White with varying opacity mottling due to calcite inclusions was observed. White and light brown micro laminations were also present. The shapes of the cuttings were largely blocky to sub-blocky and occasionally sub-platy. The texture was dominantly a grainstone, varying from silty to very ﬁne grain crystalline. Visible porosity was generally very poor to poor. Trace to small amounts of disseminated pyrite with occasional nodules was observed. Overall, calcareous/dolomitic cementing in parts was observed. </p>

Visible inter-granular porosity was absent to very poor. No oil staining was observed. <br/>The samples ﬂuorescence is dull yellow when observed under a ﬂuoroscope, though ﬂuorescence is most likely due to residual invert mud in the cuttings. Faint milky cuts that were observed were also attributed to the presence of invert residue in the samples. </p>

The kick-off depth of 10072’ (MD) was reached on December 16, 2014. A trip was made to pick up the curve BHA and a trip gas of 209 units was detected. The 8 *7.” hole was kicked off to the north at an azimuth of 320°. Very slow to slow diffuse milky cuts were observed due to residual invert ﬂuid after cleaning. Background gas was between 50 to 100 units. <br/>Lodgepole Formation Lithology Descriptions Composite samples were caught in 30’ intervals from 9804’ (MD) to <br/>10720’ (MD) (False Bakken Top) by manually catching rock cuttings in samples. <br/>The Lodgepole is predominately comprised of argillaceous limestone that ranged from being a mudstone to a wackestone, shades of gray, mainly microcrystalline though very ﬁne crystalline in places, ﬁrm with slightly brittle in places, occasional laminations, very earthy textures, waxy texture, and no visible porosity with differing amounts of silt through the formation. Slow milky blue cuts were observed but most likely due to residual invert drilling ﬂuid. <br/>False Bakken Shale </p>

The well bore is estimated to have been in target zone 96% of the lateral. The overall dip was 89.85°. <br/>Structural dip was 89.85° in the beginning of the lateral between the intermediate casing shoe and 13300’ (MD). This section had the lowest amount of background gas averaging from 65 to 85 units. Directly out of the shoe the wellbore entered the Lower Bakken Shale and remained out of target for 428’, between 10957’ (MD) and 11385’ (MD). <br/>From 13000' (MD) to 15000’ (MD) a localized dip of 90° was observed. During this time the wellbore was positioned slightly above the center of the target window and background gas began to increase to average between 4500 and 6500 units. Between 15000’ (MD) and 17000’ (MD) structural dip decreased to 89.85° and then decreased again to 89.7" between 17200’ (MD) and 18200’ (MD). Gas through this section of the well averaged between and 6000 units with connection gas peaks averaging 6500 to 7500 units. </p>

Total gas in this section averaged 5500 units with connection gas peaks averaging 7000 units. Overall placement of the well bore over this section was between the middle to the top of the target window. <br/>At 20000’ (MD) the formation gradually increased to 89.9° and maintained relatively ﬂat until TD at 20566’ (MDfr D). Formation gas averaged between 6000 units and 7000 units as the well bore gradually moved up in structure to reach TD at the top of the target window. Observed connection gas peaks averaged between 7000 and 7300 units. <br/>Nearly all samples exhibited spotty to even yellow/amber ﬂuorescence when examined under a ﬂuoroscope. Oil cuts were commonly slow to moderately fast, diffuse milky blue in color, leaving occasional residual rings. Many samples were contaminated with petroleum-based lubricant, which was used to achieve adequate bit weight to drill and to slide. This contamination masked some ﬂuorescence and oil cuts in some of the samples. </p>

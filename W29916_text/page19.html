The well is located in the Mondak Field in the southwest portion of the Williston Basin, North Dakota. The main well used for correlation was the vertical and curve sections of the Grizzly 16-21—16-1H3 in Section 21, T147 N, R 103 W. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Dagny Taggart 3-21-16H was spud on December 8, 2014. Brara Geologic Consulting arrived on site December 14, 2014. A Mudlogging Systems, Inc. Redbox (#ML-462) gas detection system was used for analyzing and recording total gas and chromatograph data. Surface casing for the Dagny Taggart 3-21-16H was set at 2129’ (MD). An invert mud system was used to drill out from surface throughout the landing of the curve. <br/>The ﬁrst bottom hole assembly (BHA) run included (Bit #2) an 8 ‘74” Smith MSDi616, a Hunting 1.5° mud motor, and a Weatherford Positive Pulse MWD tool. This assembly drilled 416236’ in 41 hours from surface casing to 8386’ (MD), where a trip was made due to low ROP. The next BHA included (Bit #3) an 8 V4” Smith MDi616, a Hunting 1.5° mud motor, and a Weatherford Positive Pulse MWD tool. This assembly drilled 1707’ in 23 hours to the kick-off point (KOP) at 10072’ MD, 10069.6’ TVD, (-7868.6’ SS). The KOP was reached at 22:13 on December 16, 2014, and a trip was made for the curve assembly. <br/>Curve Section Drilling operations resumed on December 17, 2014 at 12:40 with the <br/>curve assembly. This BHA included (Bit #4) an 8 V4“ Smith MDi516 bit paired with a Weatherford 2.5° bend mud motor and Weatherford Positive pulse MWD/gamma tool. This assembly drilled 828’ in 14.5, at an average of 75 ﬁlm ROP, to the landing of the curve at 10900’ MD, 10575.9’ TVD, (-8374.9’ SS). The curve was landed at 10:00 on December 18, 2014 at an inclination of 82.89° and an azimuth of 319.59°, in Section 21, T 147 N, R 103 W, (748’ FNL & 2468’ FWL). Seven inch (7") intermediate casing was set at 10584’ (MD), and cemented. <br/>Lateral Section <br/>The intermediate casing shoe was drilled out on at 20:21 on December 21, 2014 with a new BHA and a 9.7 lb/gal salt water mud system. This BHA included (Bit #5) a 6” Smith MDi513, with a Hunting 6/7 8.0 stage, 1.5° and 5’ bit to bend, an Weatherford MFR LWD (Resistivity/Gamma tool), and a Weatherford HEL (survey tool).This assembly drilled 9172’ in 100.08 hours to total depth (TD) </p>

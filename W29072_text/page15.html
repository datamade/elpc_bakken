    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation’s Tiisto 43-7H is a grassroots well located in the NE of the SE Section 7 T154N R91W in Mountrail County, North Dakota. It is a single lateral horizontal well the Middle Bakken siltstone, drilled on a 2560-acre spacing unit. The well was spudded on November 21, 2014 and reached a total depth of 17,715' at 11:15 AM CDT on December 14, 2014. Dave Edwards and Chris Calame were onsite for well site supervision, along with Scott Strahm and Stephanie Connole representing Neset Consulting Service, Inc for wellsite geological services. <br/>Wellsite services began at the logging depth of 8,100’ MD, at 4:00 PM CDT, on December 5, 2014. Two man geological services were used for the vertical, curve and lateral. A Total Gas detector was utilized for gas analysis. Samples were caught every thirty feet throughout the vertical section and curve. Samples were caught every ﬁfty feet through the lateral. All samples caught were saved to be archived at the ND Core and Sample Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical Section </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Base of the Last salt, the main correlatory marker to this point came in at 8,365’ MD and 8,358’ TVD, 15’ high to the prognosis. <br/>MISSION CANYON 8,521’ All) 8,514’ TVD -6,160’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon top was picked at 8,521’ MD and 8,514’ TVD a drop in ROP, from .5 min/ﬂ to .9 min/ft a spike in differential pressure and torque and a change in sample texture and color. The Mission Canyon came in 1’ low of the prognosis and drilled consistently with ROP between .48 and 1.65 min/ﬂ. Samples in the Mission Canyon were primarily blocky argillaceous limestone that was brown to gray brown with traces off white to light cream gray anhydrite and medium gray dolomite throughout There were no signiﬁcant shows in the Mission Canyon. <br/>LODGEPOLE 9,210’ MD 9,203 ’ TVD -6, 84 7’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole formation came in at 9,210’ MD and TVD of 9,203’MD. The Lodgepole was encountered even to the prognosis, and picked off of differential pressure and torque, and conﬁrmed with a sudden increase in gamma. Gamma increased up from 13.54 API units to 29.02 API units to mark the top of the Lodgepole. Samples in the Lodgepole were mostly light to medium gray tan to gray brown limestone with minimal ﬂuorescence and dull weak to slow milky yellow cuts. </p>

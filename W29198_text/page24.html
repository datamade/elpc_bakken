The landing placed the wellbore 20 vertical feet into the middle Bakken. <br/>Lateral Wellbo re 11,206 ’— 21, 729’ MD <br/>When drilling activity returned to the Mrachek 21-16-5H, it represented the last lateral drilled in the 4 well series/sequence. On November 7‘“, 2014 at 1:00 am CT the bit exited the casing shoe and entered formation low to an eight foot target window. Projected at 900°, the <br/>target window was heavily drawn upon data and characteristics acquired while drilling the 3 adjacent lateral wellbores. <br/>As with all 4 other laterals, this one needed to be turned to an azimuth of 180° south. The Mrachek 21-26—5H turn was the greatest in degrees of change at 77°. Initial samples of sandy dolomite soon gave way to a more dominate gray, sand/siltstone and showed good signs of petroleum. Gas values were more modest at a background of 600 total units. In just 500 feet, the wellbore was brought up into the target window. The gamma and sample data veriﬁed the estimated position of zone and provided enough data to reﬁne the target angle to 89.85°. <br/>Over the course of the ﬁrst 3,800 feet, the wellbore weaved up and down through the 8 foot target window until slide drilling for direction was eventually completed. The multiple contacts with the top and bottom of zone exposed the same characteristics now seen in all four laterals. Gas and petroleum shows increased when drilling in the clean, tan dolomite high in zone and declined when drilling in the gray sand/siltstone low in zone. Soon aﬁer completion of the directional turn, more control of the inclination was achieved. <br/>On November 8*, 2014 at 7:10 pm CT a trip out of the hole began due to a low rate of penetration. Drilling resumed the next morning at 8 am CT. Generally seen later in the lateral, increased volumes of lubricant degrade and destroy cuttings before they reach surface. The large turn in the wellbore required an early use of wellbore lubricant. The result was poor to, at time, no samples available early in the lateral. <br/>When drilling resumed the wellbore continued to track zone, generally along the bottom line. The down-dip angle was extending ﬁlrther out into the lateral than had been expected or seen in the other 3 laterals. Gamma and any available sample data was continually verifying the target position and angle. On November 9*, 2014 at 10: 15 pm CT another trip to surface was made due to low rate of penetration. Drilling resumed the next morning at 2:30 am CT. Occasional adjustments were made, including one brief up—dip interval, as the downward trend continued. With the wellbore at the top line of the target at measured depth 17,622 feet a third trip for low penetration rates was made. The trip began November 10‘”, 2014 at 11:20 pm CT and drilling resumed the following day at 3:45 pm CT <br/>The encounter with the top of zone became an exit out of the window, followed by a rapid drop to the window’s bottom line. The vertical pass through the target returned gamma data that indicated that he formation had turned up. A new target of 900° was applied and progressively raised to 901°. Samples were still of very poor quality, however their general composition was believed to reinforce the target position. Despite their poor quality, samples </p>

The course of the wellbore would track the target zone at an azimuth of 180°. This well is located along state highway 200, 5 miles north west of Alexander, North Dakota in the NE NW ‘A Section 26 T151N R102W. The <br/>bottom hole coordinates of the Mrachek 21-26—5H are located 261' FSL & 579' FEL in the SE SE 'A of Section 35 T151N R102W. <br/>This well was spud on September 26*, 2014. Well site geological services began at measured depth 9,000 feet, within the Charles formation. One hour, ten foot, thirty foot, and ﬁﬁy foot lagged samples were caught by roughnecks, geologist/mud loggers and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Surface of the well was drilled using salt water brine and a 13.5 inch bit. Casing measuring 9 5/8” was set and cemented at 2,257 feet measured/true vertical depth. The vertical wellbore, and curve were then both drilled using petroleum based invert mud. The eight and three quarter inch wellbore was drilled to the end of the curve tangent where intermediate 7” casing was set at 11,195 feet measured depth. The lateral was drilled with a six inch bit using saltwater based drilling ﬂuid. Gas monitoring equipment was provided by Neset Consulting Services, using a Total Gas system. <br/>Vertical wellbore <br/>The 9,000 foot logging depth was reached September 30*, 2014 at 12:10 pm CT. It was the second vertical and curve segment to be drilled on the location in a four well series. For logistical reasons the previous well, Mrachek 21-26H was drilled to completion before these next 3 were drilled sequentially. The initial true vertical depth target of 10,788 feet correlated with formation depths seen on the adjacent Mrachek 21-26H <br/>Base of Last Charles Salt 9,284’ MD 9,239 ’ TVD -7,053 ’ SS <br/>The BLS was identiﬁed at the depth it had been expected at 9,239 feet true vertical depth using gamma, sample and rate of penetration data. Correlations made with the marker suggested no change in the targeted landing depth. Sampled cuttings from the Charles revealed alternating beds of, translucent to clear blocky salt, limestone, dolomite, and anhydrite. Petroleum shows in the Charles were better than average and gas was over 100 total units in the short interval that was logged. <br/>[Mission Canyon 9, 506’ MD 9,461 ’ TVD -7,275 ’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation top was identiﬁed at measured depth 9,506 feet, and true vertical depth of 9,461 feet, also with gamma, sample and rate of penetration data. Lagged samples indicated a dolomitic cap overlying a thick bed of limestone, ranging in colors of tan, brown, light brown, gray to light gray, and cream. The deposits were crystalline to </p>

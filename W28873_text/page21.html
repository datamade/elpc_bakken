Once finish grade was established, a milling machine was used to combine commercial grade Portland cement with sub~grade. The milling machine pulverized and mixed the soil and cement together at a depth of 8". Water was added to milling process, as necessary, to meet optimum moisture content of soil. <br/>Once milling process was complete, a smooth drum roller compacted milled material into place. A motor grader then established ﬁnal surface grade. <br/>Affected area was then left untouched for approximately 24 hours to allow for curing process of treated area. <br/>  <br/>                                <br/>      <br/>Hess Bakken Investments ll, LLC 701-420-6900 Address <br/>Minot ND 58701 Signature /' Printed Name <br/> mam <br/>Title Date Senior Re ulato Technician March 26, 2015 Email Address <br/>rtrieloff hess.com <br/>FOR STATE USE ONLY <br/>Date  <br/>            </p>

Commingled gas from the discharge of Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU) compressors will be metered and allocated back to the individual wells based upon each well prorated share of continuously metered oil volumes from the treater Coriolis meters and not producing well stream GOR. This reflects that for similar crude oils gas volumes in solution within "saturated separator barrels" leaving treaters is primarily a function of separation "flash" conditions and not producing GOR from the well. The coriolis meters at the treaters will be measuring "saturated" separator barrels containing the soon to be liberated tank gas vapor still in solution before finally flashing at tank conditions. <br/>Continuous Metering: Individual Well "Monthly Well Water Production": <br/>Continuously metered well water meter volume will be used for individual well produced water volume. Produce water meters will primarily be used for production reporting and assigning produced water cost to the pertinent interest owners. </p>

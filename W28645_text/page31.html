The wellbore would begin rising gradually in the formation following the drilling of the shoe. A downslide was put in at 10,820’ MD to counter this rise. This downslide would send the wellbore dropping in the formation. A high side slide was put in at 11,038’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. This slide would send the wellbore rising in the formation. 3 downslides were put in at 11,712’ MD to send the wellbore back down in <br/>the formation. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Liner: There will be an impermeable 20 mill liner beneath the entire location. <br/>Dikes: There a minimum of 3’ containment berm as measured from pad elevation around the perimeter of the location. This is in addition to the 30” average fill over the majority of the location, bringing the net dike top elevation 66" above grade. <br/>Cuttings: The cuttings will be hauled off and disposed of at an approved third party location. <br/>Surface Agreement: We have a surface agreement in place that was previously provided on July 23'“. We also have approved access to the location, as well as a special use permit from the city. Both of these documents were provided on August 7‘“. <br/>Water string: Oasis will set a 350’ water string on this well and will make all necessary associated modifications at the surface. <br/>As we discussed, Oasis Petroleum is fully committed to conducting our operations in a safe and responsible manner, including compliance with all pertinent regulatory requirements. Given these wells’ proximity to the City of Williston, Oasis is particularly sensitive to the heightened scrutiny at this location. We have worked closely with the City to ensure that we will be a good neighbor during all phases of the well, from construction to production. <br/>Please let me know if there is anything else you require to obtain approval. As stated on previous occasions, we are on an extremely tight timeframe and would like to commence construction prior to the week's end. </p>

The target zone was a ten foot thick window existing approximately ﬁfteen feet below the Upper Bakken Shale. The ground elevation is 2,627’ above sea level with a Kelly Bushing of 26’ to make the total KB at 2,653”. This well is located in Section 18 T147N R96W Dunn County, North Dakota. The LK-A QTR CIR-147-96-1807H-4 was spudded on January 5, 2015 and reached a total depth for the vertical hole and curve at 1 1,710 feet measured depth and 11,417’ true vertical depth on January 10, 2015, 6 days from spud. <br/>Total depth of the LK-A QTR CIR—147-96-1807H-4 lateral was reached at 21,805’ measured depth on January 20, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. CDT. The bottom hole location is 384.54’ FNL and 1,725.81 ’ FWL, Section 7 T147N R96W. This well was drilled using an invert based mud system for the vertical / curve, and saline-rich salt water for the lateral. Tim Purdy and Devin Pays of Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided the Well Site Geo-steering, Mud Logging and Gas Detection Services beginning at a depth of 9,030’ in the Kibbey Lime through the total depth in the Three Forks Formation. The services were provided through the curve and lateral portion of the Three Forks Fonnation. Samples were caught from lagged depths at intervals <br/>between 10 — 100 feet. <br/>Kibbey Lime 9,058 ’ MD 9,04 7’ TVD —6,394 ’ SS </p>

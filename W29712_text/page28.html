Gas Plant-Grassland Plant, Sec. 36—T148N-R105W <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>2b. ONEOK; see attachments <br/>2c. See attachments <br/>3a. Maximum Current Capacity of Gathering Segment: 35 000 MCFD <br/>3b. Current Throughput of Gathering Segment: 18 000 MCFD <br/>3c. Anticipated Capacity of Gathering Segment At lP Date: 35 000 MCFD <br/>3d. Anticipated Throughput of Gathering Segment At lP Date: 35 000 MCFD <br/>3e. There are plans to expand Lost Bridge up to 45 MMCFD (exact date of completion TBD). Lost <br/>Bridge has capacity of35 MMCFD, but the takeaway is limited to 20 MMCFD until the 16” discharge line is constructed, which is currently in ROW. Additional capacity plans include a North Dunn compressor station which will add 30 MMCFD of capacity to this area (completion dates TBD). Estimated throughput does not include the referenced wells. Forecasted volumes will exceed capacity until the Lost Bridge discharge line is constructed (completion date TBD). <br/>Flowback Strategy 4a. First production is expected 5/25/15, Gas sales connection is TBD (see 3e). 4b. Anticipated oil and gas rates: IP 1738 BOPD, 1736 MCFD <br/>Amount of Gas Applicant is Currently Flaring Sa. Statewide percentage of gas flared: 12.35% (7/2014) 5b. Fieldwide percentage of gas flared: Rattlesnake Point, 5.32% (7/2014) <br/>Alternatives to Flaring <br/>6a. Purchaser capacity is expected to be sufficient for the volumes produced from these wells. In the event that electric power is required on-site, a natural gas powered generator will be evaluated. Installation of a liquid stripping plant to be utilized in the event of upset conditions would not be economic. Such an installation will be re—evaluated as additional wells are completed and if conditions change. <br/>6b. A natural gas powered generator could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 45—60 MCFD. A liquid stripping plant could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 40%. On lease gas use by Heater/Treaters will consume approximately 25 MCFD </p>

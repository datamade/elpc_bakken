Each well will ﬂow into its own single treater. Marathon will continuously meter the oil production, and then combine the wells’ oil production into the same set of tanks for sales. Marathon will do the same for the water production. Oneok will have separate gas sales meters for each of the wells. b. Production per well is calculated as follows (for each oil and water): i. Well metered volume — The production that is metered continuously directly from the treater outlets by Marathon. ii. Total metered volume — Sum of all metered volumes for the comingled wells iii. Total actual volume — Actual production for is determined by the trucked or LACT volumes iv. Correction factor — This is determined by dividing the total actual volume by the total metered volume. This will account for any shrinkage in the tanks. v.

Water -— 1.5” Turbines Inc. TMOZOO Turbine Meter with a Cameron MCIII EXP Turbine Meter Flow Analyzer <br/>b. The gas from each treater will continue to have its own separate sales meter, proved by the third party gas gatherer Oneok. <br/>c. In the event of a meter failure, well production allocation will be established by a knowledgeable person until the meter is back online. <br/>d. Once a LACT unit is installed, there will be two divert tanks, only one will be diverted into at a time. When Divert TK 1 is full, the LACT divert will be manually switched to the Divert TK 2. Divert TK 1 will then be isolated, gauged, recycled to a speciﬁed treater, and then gauged again. This recycled oil total (calculated from the level change in Divert TK 1) will then be subtracted from the metered total for the oil from that speciﬁed treater. </p>

Gas levels peaked at 544 total gas units. Drilling rates averaged .66 minutes per foot while landing the curve. <br/>Lateral 11,409’ — 20,298’ MD <br/>The intermediate casing shoe was drilled out at 12:00 PM CST February 24‘“. Invert was displaced with salt water as drilling ﬂuid for the lateral. A Security MM64 was installed as hit number 6. The landing was made about 15 feet below the Upper <br/>Bakken Shale. Middle Bakken thickness was estimated at 28 feet. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Immediately below the Upper Bakken Shale there was a cool zone of 50-60 API, which was seen only during the landing. Upper target zone and above showed layered and inconsistent gamma levels from 75-100 counts. A consistent cool-gamma zone of 4070 API provided a marker at 10 feet below the Upper Bakken Shale. The top of the D facies at approximately 16 feet below the Upper Bakken showed the top of a tighter, more consistent zone with 85-95 APIA <br/>Wherever cooler-gamma sections appeared, rate of penetration would slow down and be prone to deﬂections in inclination. These lower-gamma areas typically showed less clay content, and appeared to be harder than the higher-gamma areas, judging from drilling behavior. Samples in these areas also did not readily take tooling striations from the drillstringi Cutting fragments tended to be larger. </p>

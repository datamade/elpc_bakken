The initial phase of the P Vance 154—97-16-9—21-16H3 is a vertical hole, followed by a curve landing in the Three Forks Cycle 1 formation. The Vance 154—9716-9-21-16H3 spud December 8, 2014 and reached a total depth of 21,812’MD on January 1, 2015. Wellsite geological services began at 9,000 feet just above the Base of the Last Salt formation. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota and at Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation in Denver, Colorado. <br/>Vertical 9, 000’ — 11,306’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 9,000 feet measured depth in The Charles Formation. Gas detection system was recalibrated and tested before logging depth with system functioning correctly. Drill rates averaged 0.74 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 11 to 3435 total units. <br/>Base of Last Salt 9,235 ’ MD 9,234 ’ TVD 7,1 4 7’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered at 9,234’ TVD; 7,147’ SS. Base of the last salt was picked by the last sample with salt present, this was accompanied by an increase in ROP. The rig auto driller was set to 125 feet per hour through the salt in order to help ease fall in from the brittle salt. The salt was opaque to off white in color, brittle, subangular, and massive. Samples then became beds of limestone, anhydrite, and occasional shale, until the Mission Canyon. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,439’ MD 9,438 ’ T VD 7,351 ’ SS <br/>Mission Canyon was picked from lithology change and the offset log, gamma also cleaned up once we entered the formation. ROP averaged 0.71 minutes a foot. Samples consisted of a mottled limestone, light grey-brown to cream, ﬁml, micro to very ﬁne crystalline, no visible intercrystalline porosity, abundant anhydrite, trace dark brown to olive green oil stain, scattered to even yellow ﬂuorescence, fast yellow-green milky cut, to a faint blue yellow cut. Gas ranged from 51 to 505 total units while drilling in the Mission Canyon. </p>

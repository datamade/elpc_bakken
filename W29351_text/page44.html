    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Bergstrom 11-13TFH is a Three Forks well laterally drilled by Unit 120 for Whiting Oil and Gas Corp. (API# 33-105-03746) and is located at Section 12 T156N R97W 630’ FSL & 835’ FWL. The bottom hole coordinates are in Section 24 T156N R97W, 269.65’ F SL & 1,312.18’ FWL. The well was spudded on October 26, 2014. A total measured depth of 20,555’ MD was reached at 12:00 pm on January 4, 2014. All data is either logged by Jonathan Stoltman or Anthony Sarnoski, of Neset Consulting. Wellsite geological services began at 7,225’ MD above the Tyler on October 31, 2014 at 3 :20 am CST. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 7,225 ’—9, 684’ MD <br/>Mudlogging service began above the Tyler formation 'on October 31, 2014 at 3:20 am CST at 7,225' MD. The entire vertical section was drilled with invert diesel, and alter intermediate casing the drilling ﬂuid used was Brine. Rates of penetration for the vertical <br/>section averaged 55 feet/hour with a maximum of 235 feet/hour. The vertical ended at the KOP of 9,684’ MD on November 3, 2014. <br/>Tyler 7,244’ MB 7,23 7’ T VD -4,9 73 ’ SS <br/>The Tyler formation was reached shortly after logging began. It came in at 7,244’ MD and 7,237’ TVD. This was 12 feet high to prognosis. Gamma was the main indicator <br/>in identifying the Tyler. Typical samples were red siltstone with trace amounts of light gray limestone. </p>

Gamma was used 'to pick the top of the Kibbey Lime. Samples in the Kibbey were a mix of limestone, siltstone and anhydrite. ROP averaged 48 ft/hr and background gas had a max of 51 units. <br/>Charles 7,919’ Ml) 7,911 ’ T VD -5,647’ SS <br/>The Charles was encountered at 7,919’ MD and 7,911’ TVD which was 14 feet high to prognosis. The Charles was picked using a combination of gamma and samples. Shortly after the top of the Charles came in the samples switched from a red, brown, siltstone with moderate cream, white gummy anhydrite. ROP ranged from 11 ﬁ/hr to 337 ﬁ/hr. Background gas averaged 37 units with a maximum of 67 units and a minimum of 22 units. </p>

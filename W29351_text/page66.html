    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The inclination of the formation was calculated at an 896° overall dip. After drilling out of the shoe, the wellbore climbed up to a 94°. The directional team used slides to bring the wellbore back down within a degree of the overall dip and also in the target window. Samples up this high were: DOLOMITE: Light brown, light tan, cream, brown, light gray, gray, oﬁ‘ white, light blue, silty, microcrystalline, very ﬁne, microsucrosic, mottled, calcareous, carbonaceous, soft to ﬁrm, argillaceous, moderate pyrite, poor intergranular porosity, dull yellow ﬂuorescence, very weak streaming cut. <br/>At 11,402’ MD the wellbore entered the top of the target window. Samples here looked like this: DOLOMITE: Very light to light tan, light to medium brown, light gray, light blue green, cream, oﬁ‘ white, silty, microcrystalline, very ﬁne, sucrosic, mottled, calcareous, carbonaceous, soft to ﬁrm, argillaceous, poor intergranular porosity, dull orange to yellow ﬂuorescence, very slow cloudy cut. The gas detector went down at 11,471 ’ MD. A new machine was brought out and began reading gas counts again at 11,789’ MD. <br/>The wellbore stayed inside the target window until 12,500’ MD where it climbed up above the window. The samples here were: DOLOMITE: Light gray tan, very light blue gray, light tan, very light brown, cream, off white, silty, microcrystalline, very ﬁne, microsucrosic, mottled, calcareous, carbonaceous, soft to ﬁrm, argillaceous, trace pyrite, poor intergranular porosity, dull orange ﬂuorescence, very weak cloudy cut. The wellbore continued to above the target window until 14,415’ MD where it dropped back into the window. <br/>After staying in the target window for a little over 2000 feet the wellbore climbed up out of the top of the window. Samples here were: DOLOMITE: Light brown, cream, light blue gray, very light tan, light gray, silty, microcrystalline, very ﬁne, microsucrosic, mottled, calcareous, carbonaceous, soft to ﬁrm, argillaceous, moderate pyrite, poor intergranular porosity, dull orange ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy cut. The wellbore 'reentered the target window at 17,400’ MD. Upon reentering the window formation kicked the inclination of the wellbore to an 87.5°. At this steep of an inclination we went right through the window and out of the bottom. Directional used slides to bring the wellbore back up into the window. On January 1, 2015 at 18,281 ’ MD Unit 120 made a trip for a <br/>mud motor at 2:45 pm CST. Drilling operations resumed at 11:00 am CST on January 2, 201 5. </p>

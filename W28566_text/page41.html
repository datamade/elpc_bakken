Gas ranged from 17 to 120 units with a small drilling break at approximately 10,780’ MD producing a 543 unit show. Additionally, a gas show of 884 units was seen from the Scallion. At 10,358’ MD KOP was reached and a trip was made to pick up curve assembly and begin drilling the curve. This trip produced 53 units of trip gas. While drilling the curve very poor build rates were seen and at 10,740’ MD a trip was made to pick up a cone bit to get better results. The Lodgepole came in 7’ high to prognosis. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Upper Bakken Shale 10,870’ MD 10, 774’ T VD -8, 5 01 ’ SS <br/>The Bakken Shale was picked from gamma change. Samples were shale, black, non—calcareous, carbonaceous, pyritic, smooth, ﬁssile in part, blocky to sub-blocky, no porosity, abundant dull green ﬂuorescence, immediate bright milky yellow cut. Gas increased to a high of 435 units. The Upper Bakken shale came in with prognosis. <br/>Middle Bakken 10, 928 ’ MD 10, 794’ T VD -8, 521 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken Member was picked from gamma change. Samples were dolomite, light gray brown, light brown, tan, minor cream, microcrystalline, rarely pyritic, moderately silty, moderately calcareous, slightly argillaceous, earthy, microsucrosic in part, poor intercrystalline porosity, rare spotty dark brown oil stain, scattered dull yellow green ﬂuorescence, with an immediate bright milky white to yellow cut. Gas ranged from 70 to 145 units with connection gases ranging from 101 to 212 units. The Middle Bakken Member came in 1’ low to prognosis. <br/>The curve was drilled to a depth of 11,093’ MD at 6:30 pm CT on January 13, 2015. Casing was set at 11,081’ MD, 10,809.81’ TVD and 436.37’ VS. BHL of casing was 1,205.99’ FNL & 1,472.32’ FEL in Sec 25, T150N, and R97W. <br/>Lateral 1 11,081 ’ — 20,202 ’ MD <br/>Casing was exited on February 2, 2015 at 11:30 am CT. Casing was set approximately 16’ into the Middle Bakken. Build rates toward the end of the curve showed to be dropping off so extra slide was put in at landing. However, at TD of curve the last survey showed a very high build rate which resulted in a much higher than anticipated angle at landing. The planned target was a 22’ window with emphasis put on a hot marker approximately 9’ into the target zone to use for steering reference. Drilling began with the bit coming out of casing at 93° and showing high gamma counts indicating the hot marker. Corrections were made and the bit leveled oﬁ‘ 3-4’ below the top of target zone. At 11,450’ an azimuth turn was started. Slides were held slightly on the down side to bring the bit down to targets near the hot marker. At 11,900’ MD the hot marker was seen, giving a good dip calculation and verifying that formation was closely following the previous well. After seeing the hot marker a jump in angle was seen due to a bounce off of the hard streak in, or just slightly below the hot marker. Corrections were made and the bit came down and passed through the hot marker. At </p>

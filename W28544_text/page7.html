The following assurances apply: 1. The well is equipped with new 29#, 7" casing from surface to 11,656' MDI 11,272' TVD with an API burst rating of 8,160psi/11,220psi 2. The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.80* API burst rating to determine the max pressure. 3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment. 4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during the flowback than during the frac job. 5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates. 6. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing. 7. A 300# gauge will be installed on surface casing during flowback operation. <br/>   <br/>       <br/>                                                                            <br/>  <br/>       <br/>XTO Ener .Inc. 303-397-3735 P.O.

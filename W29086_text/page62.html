This well is located on the NENW corner of Section 15, T14ON, R99W in Stark County, North Dakota. The Cymbaluk Federal PH was spudded on December 24th, 2014 and reached a total depth of 21,223’ MD at 4: 15 AM MST on January 9th, 2015; sixteen days from spud. Wellsite geologic services were provided by Neset Consulting Service and began logging at a depth of 8,050’ MD in the Amsden Formation, at 7:30 AM MST on December 28th, 2014. Samples were caught, cleaned and described by the mudloggers for the entirely of the well. Thirty to one hundred foot lagged samples were caught and saved to be archived at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Total Gas Ltd was used to monitor and record gas in correspondence with Rig Sense EDR. <br/>Tyler 8,203 ' MD 8,200' TVD -5, 55 6 ' SS <br/>Logging started at 8,050’ MD in the Amsden formation. The Tyler Formation was encountered at 8,203’ MD. The top of the formation came in 5 feet low to the prognosis. The top of the formation was deﬁned by a heat up in gamma. As drill rates declined the decision was made to trip out of the hole to replace the BHA at 8,43 7’ MD. The rig crew started tripping out of the hole at 2:00 PM MST on December 28th, 2014. After changing out the BHA and tripping back to bottom, they resumed drilling the vertical at 10:00 PM that evening. <br/>Kibbey Lime 8, 654 'IWD 8,651 ' TVD ~6,007' SS <br/>The Kibbey Lime Formation was next encountered, samples changed in lithology from a cream colored anhydrite to a light to medium gray limestone at the top of the Kibbey Lime. The top of the Kibbey Lime formation came in at 8,654’ MD and was deﬁned by correlating drill rates with an offset well and later conﬁrmed by gamma. The <br/>top of the formation came in 8 feet high to prognosis. Background gases averaged 17 units throughout the formation. <br/>Charles 8, 791 ’ MD 8, 788' T VD -6,144' SS <br/>The top of the Charles Formation was deﬁned by a gamma marker as the MWD tool crossed the top of the formation, along with a change in samples from a light to medium gray limestone, to a clear, frosty, blocky salt. The top of the Charles formation <br/>came in 12 feet low to the prognosis. The Charles consisted of interbedded layers of salt, limestone, and anhydrite. Background gas was recorded at an average of 78 units throughout the formation. </p>

At this time a trip to surface was made to run and cement intermediate casing. <br/>Lateral Wellbore 10,640' — 21,223 ' MD <br/>Intermediate casing was set at a measured depth of 10,880’ MD. The ﬁrst run of the lateral was made with a Smith Z613, 6” drill bit. They started drilling the lateral at 1:15 PM MST on January 2'“, 2014. <br/>The landing for the curve was lower than planned, landing at the base of the ten foot target window. To get back in to zone as soon as possible the directional driller put in a slide soon after drilling out of the shoe. The well plan called for a 60 degree turn in the lateral so as the directional driller performed slides for the turn he was also able to steer the wellbore up in inclination. <br/>At 1 1,481 ’ MD there was an MWD failure and a trip to surface to pick up a new BHA. The rig crew started tripping out of the hole at 9:00 PM MST on January 2nd, 2015. Aﬁer picking up a new BHA and tripping back to bottom they resumed drilling the lateral at 10:00 AM MST on January 3”. <br/>As drilling proceeded the directional driller continued to steer the wellbore up in inclination, so as to encounter the clean gamma bench along the top of the zone. The <br/>differentiation between the cool and warm gamma bench would be used to calculate formation dip throughout the lateral. <br/>Having encountered the clean gamma the directional driller turned the wellbore back down in inclination to steer it back into the target window. Formation dip was initially calculated at 90 degrees out to 12,500’ MD. At this point dip started to increase and was found to be at 90.4 degrees. As they drilled ahead, the directional team kept the wellbore in the middle to lower section of the target window, out to 15,600” MD, where the inclination dropped to 87.7 degrees, dropping the wellbore out the base of the target window. <br/>The directional driller implemented a series of slides to steer the wellbore back up in inclination. At 15,877’ MD drill rates had dropped below 100 ﬁ/hr and as a result a trip to surface was made at 4:00 AM MST on January 5'“, 2015, to replace the BHA. Aﬁer picking up a new BHA and tripping back to bottom they resumed drilling the lateral at 4:15 PM MST that afternoon. Upon returning to drilling the MWD tool quit responding. They rotated the rest of the stand down to try and get a response from the tool with no result. At 15,929’ MD they started tripping out of the hole at 5:45 PM MST to pick up a new MWD tool. Aﬁer picking up the tool and tripping back to bottom they resumed drilling the lateral at 6:30 AM MST on January 6th, 2015. <br/>As they drilled ahead the directional team steered the wellbore back up in inclination to enter back in to the target window. The wellbore entered the base of the target window at 16,350’ MD and was allowed to climb in zone, up to the top of the </p>

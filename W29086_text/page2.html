Gamma correlations revealed a formation dip of 91 degrees starting at 16,500’ MD and continuing to 16,950’ MD, The wellbore encountered the clean gamma section along the top of the zone at 17,000’ MD. Drilling continued along the top of the zone out to 18,200’ MD at which point the gamma started to climb indicating that the sensor was getting close to the LBS remnant. The directional driller put in a few slides to turn the wellbore down in inclination and back into the target window. As the wellbore came down drill rates started to slow down and the decision was made to trip out of the hole to replace the BHA at 18,417’ MD. The rig crew started tripping out of the hole at 11:15 AM MST on January 7‘”, 2015. Aﬁer picking up the new assembly and tripping back to bottom they resumed drilling the lateral at 1:30 AM MST on January 8m, 2015. <br/>Once drilling continued the directional team kept the wellbore in the middle of the target window out to 19,600’ MD at which point it dropped below the base of the window. In this area slower drill rates were also experienced. The directional team put in a series of slides to turn inclinations back up and steer the wellbore into the target window. At 20,3 00’ MD the wellbore re-entered the target window and formation dip was calculated at 90.75 degrees. Once inside the target window, drill rates started to increase. The wellbore was then rotated out to a TD of 21 ,223 ’ MD. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation Cymbaluk Federal #41-15PH reached a total depth of 21,223’ MD at 4: 15 AM MST on January 9"“, 2015. This well is currently awaiting completion. <br/>Braden Mickelsen Wellsite Geologist </p>

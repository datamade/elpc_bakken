Wisness 150—100-23-148H, a horizontal well, was drilled by H&P 255 in the Middle Bakken targeting the Middle Bakken Dolomite 10 to 20 feet into the Middle Bakken. The Wisness 150-10023-14-8H well spudded December 27th, 2014 and reached a total depth of 21, 146’ MD on January 9, 2014 Wellsite geological services began at 8,800 feet in the Kibbey Lime Formation. The gas detection system used was Neset Total Gas. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected in the vertical section and curve. Fifty foot samples were collected in the horizontal. All lagged samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 8,800 — 10, 736’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 8,800 feet measured depth in the Kibbey Lime Formation on December 29th, 2014. Drill rates ranged from 0.9 to 8.1 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 20 to 471 units. <br/>Charles 8,875 ’ MD 8,85 7’ TVD -6,538’SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">picked due to an increase in ROP related to the Charles Salt, mixed with anhydrite. Samples consisted of a mix of Salt, Anhydrite, and Limestone. Sample characteristics showed clear, angular, crystalline, translucent, moderate anhydrite, rusty brown to orange, reddish brown, off white to cream white, trace limestone, white mineral to dull <br/>yellow ﬂuorescence, and no cut. Base Last Salt 9, 622 ' MD 9,568 ’ TVD - 7,249 ' SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered at 9,622’ MD; -7,249’ SS, and was picked by the last sample with salt present, as well as an increase in the rate of penetration of the last salt bed. Samples then became beds of limestone and anhydrite, until the Mission Canyon. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,841 ' MD 9, 778' TVD -7,459' SS <br/>Mission Canyon was picked from lithology change as well as changes in the ROP at 9,841’ MD; -7,459’ SS. Samples consisted of a Limestone that was brown, brown gray, dark gray in part, light gray to cream gray, dark gray staining in part, cream to off white, microcrystalline, mudstone, slightly argillaceous, carbonaceous, fair induration, fair intercrystalline porosity, yellow to dull green ﬂuorescence, with a weak thin cut. </p>

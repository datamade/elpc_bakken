Coming out of the shoe, the assembly took a deﬂection upwards ﬁ'om a hard streak. From that point, the well bore was drilled above the “Blue Marker” line as illustrated on the Well Tracker. There were multiple hard streaks that consisted of heavier amounts of iron pyrite and trace amounts of quartz. The well bore came back down in zone and crossed into the desired drilling window at a depth of 13,500’ MD. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The second section of the Lateral was drilled following a calculated formation dip of 89.77 to 8989 degrees until a depth of 17,500’ MD. During this section, the well bore tracked quite well along the “Green Marker” line as illustrated on the Well Tracker. There were minimal amounts of iron pyrite although multiple hard streaks were encountered. These hard streaks consisted of a higher induration in the sample cuttings. <br/>The last section of the Lateral was drilled following a steeper calculated formation dip of 89.5 degrees. During the transition to the now steeper dip, the assembly crossed above the “Blue Marker” line as illustrated on the Well Tracker. Again, sample cuttings provided increased amounts of iron pyrite and trace amounts of quartz. The assembly was turned down and resumed drilling in the desired window at 18,500’ MD to Total Depth. <br/>The entirety of the Lateral was drilled in the target window 5—20’ TVD into the <br/>Middle Bakken. The geology was mostly Dolomite which was gray brown to gray, light brown, light cream gray in part, dark beige, with trace to moderate pyrite in localized zones, microcrystalline, subrounded to subangular, calcareous, carbonaceous, argillaceous, moderate to well induration, fair to good intercrystalline porosity, even dull green to trace yellow ﬂuorescence, with a rapid cloudy cut. <br/>Throughout the Lateral, we experienced an average dip of 89.7 degrees. The well was drilled entirely in the desired window, and shale was not encountered throughout the Lateral. The Geo-steering Plan was communicated and carried out according to local calculated dips. <br/>Conclusion </p>

The curve was executed 2’ TVD within the planned target. Throughout the entire Lateral, gas averaged 431 units with values as high as 5,943 units. The wellbore was in the planned target zone for the majority of the well and the Geo-steering Plan was carried out according to local calculated dip angles. The casing point was landed 7’ TVD into the Middle Bakken Formation. The Lateral was drilled mainly 10-20’ TVD into the Middle Bakken, with no shale strikes. The Wisness 150-100-23-14-8H well was drilled in <br/>14.5 days. <br/>Jesse Freborg Wellsite Geologist </p>

(API# 33-105-03747) and is located at section 12 T156N R97W 630’ FSL & 880’ FWL. The bottom hole coordinates are in section 1 T156N R97W 261.23’ FNL & 1945.43’ FWL. The well was spudded on October 24, 2014. A total measured depth of 20,440’ MD was reached at 10:20 am CST on December 24, 2014. All data is either logged by Jonathan Stoltman or Anthony Samoski, of Neset consulting. Wellsite geological services began at 7,225’ MD above the Tyler on November 8, 2014 at 4:15 pm CST. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 7,225 ’— 9,5 9 7’ MD <br/>Mudlogging service began above the Tyler formation on November 8, 2014 at 4: 1 5 pm CST at 7,225' MD. The entire vertical section was drilled with invert diesel, and after intermediate casing the drilling ﬂuid was Brine. Rates of penetration for the vertical <br/>section averaged 63 feet/hour with a maximum of 273 feet/hour. The vertical ended at the KOP of9,597’ MD on November 11, 2014. <br/>Tyler 7,252’MD 7,250’ TVD -4,986’SS </p>

It came in at 7,252’ MD and 7,250’ TVD. This was 6 feet lower than the prognosis. The gamma ray response spikes right above the top of the Tyler and then drops down slightly at the top of the formation, this is the main indicator used in identifying the Tyler. Typical samples were dark red siltstone with interbedded dark gray to black shale and the top and bottom of the formation, with light to medium gray limestone in the middle. ROP averaged 81 feet per <br/>hour, background gas had a max of 513 units, and the gamma ray response ranged from 10 to 347 API. <br/>Kibbey Lime 7, 764 ’ MD 7, 762’ TVD -5,498 ’ SS </p>

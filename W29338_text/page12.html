Once the well was turned around it dropped slightly and then maintained formation dip, with an average ROP of 118 feet per hour, at the top of the target window. Samples consisted of: SILTSTONE: Light cream, very light gray, tan, light brown, light cream tan light gray tan, very ﬁne, sub rounded to sub angular, moderately sorted, argillaceous, calcareous, dolomitic, poor intergranular porosity, dull yellow to white ﬂuorescence, slow cloudy out. At 18,295’ a MWD tool failure forced a trip at 12:15 pm CST, on December 22, 2014. Drilling operations resumed 17 hours and 20 minutes later at 5:20 am CST on December 23, 2014. <br/>The well bore continued an updip projection at 9031", the gamma ray response values were increased as well, with a maximum reading of 168.56 API at a MD of 19,152’. This high value indicated that the well was close to the Upper Bakken Shale, but was still much lower than the values seen in the shale. Samples from the top of the formation consisted of: SILTSTONE: Light to medium cream tan, light gray, light brown, tan, light gray tan, very ﬁne, sub rounded to sub angular, moderately sorted, slightly argillaceous, calcareous, dolomitic, poor intergranular porosity, dull yellow to white ﬂuorescence, slow cloudy cut. <br/>At this point the well was turned around and descended back down towards the window at an inclination of 87.65°. The structure map project this well to continue its updip trend throughout the entirety of its path. As the well bore descended deeper the gamma signature remain consistent to what was seen above the window. The well bore reached a maximum depth of 10,122.52’ TVD at 20,008’ MD. The gamma signature is similar to what is seen at the top of the target window but was not as clean and consistent as previously seen. Sample were typical of the top of the target window: SILTSTONE: Light gray, medium cream, gray tan, light brown, light tan, cream gray, very ﬁne, sub rounded to sub angular, moderately sorted, slightly argillaceous, calcareous, dolomitic, poor intergranular porosity, dull yellow ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy out <br/>From there the well began to rise again to a maximum inclination of 924°, reaching TD at a measured depth of 20,440’ MD, with a TVD of 10,113.14’. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The Kaldahl 24-12H reached its ﬁnal destination at a MD of 20,440’ and TVD of 10,113.14’ at 10:20 am on December 24, 2014. The well is currently awaiting completion. </p>

The sidetrack began at a depth of 9,91 8’ MD at 1:30 am CST on November 13, 2014. The time drilling schedule was to trough brieﬂy and then drill at 5 minutes per inch for 4 feet and then 4 minutes per inch for 3 feet. When this was completed a slide with a tool face of 45R was initiated for 57 feet to separate the sidetrack from the original well bore. The sidetrack was successful. <br/>Samples below KOP were: LIMESTONE: Light to medium gray tan, light brown, light to medium gray, tan, cream, mottled, packstone to wackestone, soft to ﬁrm, argillaceous, carbonaceous, calcareous, dolomitic, poor intergranular porosity, dull scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy cut. Reached EOC of 10,465' MD at 8:30 pm CST on November 13, 2014. </p>

The False Bakken is identiﬁed by a sharp increase in gamma ray response, but it quickly goes back to the average response seen previously in the Lodgepole Formation. This marker came in 1 foot deeper than the prognosis and which correlated to the original landing target. Trace amounts dark gray to black shale where found in the gray limestone samples. Background gas peaked at 505 units and the maximum gamma ray response reached 93 API. <br/>Upper Bakken 10,258’ MD 10,086’ TVD -7,822 ’ SS <br/>The Bakken Shale was entered at 10,258’ MD with a TVD of 10,086’. This came in three feet deeper than the prognosis and only shifted the landing target one foot deeper. This is obvious due to the gamma ray response rapidly increasing from 31 API in the Scallion to 257 API at the top of the Upper Bakken Shale in 7 feet. The gamma ray response further increases to a maximum of 588 API. The Upper Bakken Shale is also easily visible in samples due to the change from gray limestone to black to dark gray carbonaceous shale, which are typical for the Upper Bakken Shale. Background gas peaked at 1218 units and averaged 767 throughout the Upper Bakken Shale. </p>

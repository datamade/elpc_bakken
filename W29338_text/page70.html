The top of the Charles is indicated by a steady decline in gamma ray response as well as a change from red siltstone to clear salt. Typical samples are transparent salt with minor amounts of sandstone, towards the bottom samples change to light gray limestone with minor amounts of salt, anhydrite, and dark gray to black shale. The average ROP was 82 feet per hour, with a max background gas value of 107 units, and the gamma ray response ranged from 8 to 132 API. <br/>Base ofLast Salt 8,596’ MD 8,597’ TVD -6,330’ SS <br/>The Base of Last Salt came in at 8,596’ MD and 8,597’ TVD, this was 5 feet lower than the prognosis. At the Base of the Last Salt the ROP sharply slows down from 240 feet per hour to 90 feet per hour and then further slows down after that. The gamma ray response also increases slightly at the top of the Base of the Last Salt and salt is no longer present in the samples. The samples after the last salt are light to medium gray limestone with minor amounts of dolomite. ROP averaged was 40 feet per hour, with a max background gas value of 202 units, and the gamma ray response ranged from 11 to <br/>59 API. </p>

A sharp drop in gamma ray response, from 59 API to 15 API over 4 feet, is what marks the top of this formation. Samples in the Mission Canyon were light gray to cream limestone with trace amounts of anhydrite. The average ROP through the formation was 58 feet per hour, background gas peaked at 224 units, and the gamma ray response ranged from 8 to 65 API. <br/>Lodgepole 9,430’ MD 9,428’ TVD -7,164’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole was identiﬁed at 9,430’ MD and 9,428’ TVD, which was 40 feet higher than the prognosis for this well. The top of the Lodgepole is evident by a change from a light gray limestone to darker gray limestone and a decrease in ROP. The Lodgepole Formation is a limestone that is medium gray in color with minor amounts of dolomite and argillaceous stringers. Drilling rates averaged 37 feet per hour, the <br/>maximum background gas value seen was 314 units, and the gamma ray response ranged from 11 to 68 API. </p>

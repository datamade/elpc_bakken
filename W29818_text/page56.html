    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">90.0 degree dip rate and wellbore inclination was kept at 90 degrees for the first 3500’ vertical section. <br/>Drilling ahead past 12,500’ to 13,500’ MD wellbore was moving towards the top of the target window when the clean gamma marker at the top of the geologic zone of interest. Wellbore appeared to bounce down, off ofa hard streak. Correlations suggested that formation dip was ﬂat overall but with signiﬁcant short term clips of up 0.4 degrees toe-up to toe-down. Gamma stayed in the range of 105 to 130 API units. Gas was from 225 units to 2, 000 with increases at connections. Penetration rates were between 150 to 375 feet per hour. The typical sample was, SILTSTONE: Medium gray, gray, gray brown, cream gray, off white, dark gray, cream, microcrystalline, platy, calcareous cementation, dolomitic, trace calcite, trace pyrite, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, dull blue yellow ﬂuorescence, slow yellow spotted white cloudy cut. <br/>Drilling from 13,500’ to 14,500’ the wellbore transitioned from below the center of our target window to above our target window for approximately 250’ MD. At 13,572’ MD the wellbore went below the center of our target window and we continued to drill below the center line. Continuing to drill ahead wellbore gradually moved down and up towards center of the target window, generating moderate conﬁdence correlations. While drilling ahead past 14,3 83’ MD, the decision was made to raise the target 1’ and increase inclination from 90.0 degrees to 90.5 degrees in order drill with the formation dip. Continuing to drill ahead wellbore remained in the lower half of the target window and appeared to be tracking with formation. Penetration rates averaged 350 — 450 ﬁ/hr and gamma continued to average 95 — 135 API units. Gas was between 275 to 900 units with increases of connection gas. The typical sample was; SILTSTONE: Medium gray, gray, gray brown, light brown, off white, dark gray, microcrystalline, platy, sucrosic in part, calcareous cementation, dolomitic, scattered pyrite, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, even blue white ﬂuorescence, slow weak cloudy cut. <br/>Continuing to drill ahead past 14,500’ to 15,500’ MD wellbore inclination decreased causing it to move lower in the bottom part of the window. Correlations remained fair to good, but suggested formation dip had steepened and was now estimated at 90.6 to 90.8 degrees. Targets were not changed as confidence in correlations were good and the other wells on this pad showed formation was likely to ﬂatten. The use of Enviro-Torq used to minimize torque and anti-foam agents, altered any potential oil shows. Total gas continued to average around 300 — 1,550 units with increases at connections. Gamma was between 104 to 138 API units. Penetration rates were from 150 to 400 feet per hour. The typical sample was; SILTSTONE: Medium gray, gray, gray brown, light gray, cream gray, light brown, off white, dark gray, microcrystalline, platy, calcareous cementation, dolomitic, scattered calcite, trace pyrite, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, dull blue yellow ﬂuorescence, slow weak yellow cloudy cut. <br/>Over the next 1,000’ MD from 15,500’ to 16,500’ MD wellbore climbed rapidly to keep up with formation dips of 90.3 to 90.9 degrees, the wellbore was mainly in the lower part of the target window and gamma remained steady with few ﬂuctuations. Correlations were good, but still consistently suggesting steeper dips then the target. The target inclination remained at 90.5 degrees in order to keep up with formation. It was also anticipated that formation would begin to level off later in the well. Drilling ahead past 15,500’ MD wellbore remained in the lower halfof the target window suggesting formation had ﬂattened. Latest correlations suggested well was drilled mainly in the upper half of the geologic zone of interest and dips remained high. Total gas was between 200 to 1,500 units with large increases for connections. Gamma was between 100 </p>

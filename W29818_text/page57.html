The typical samples was; SILTSTONE: Medium gray, gray brown, gray, light gray, light brown, off white, dark gray, microcrystalline, platy, sucrosic, calcareous cementation, dolomitic, trace calcite, trace pyrite, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, dull blue yellow fluorescence, slow yellow white cloudy cut. Samples were of little help with conﬁnning well’s position in zone as they continued to make very little if any change in consistency. <br/>Drilling ahead past 16,500’ to 17,500’ MD wellbore was drilled throughout the target window. The wellbore was drilled predominantly in the upper portion of the geologic zone of interest. Total gas was between 225 to 2000 units with major increases for connections. Gamma was between 85 to 140 API units. Penetration rates were from 225 feet per hour to 450 feet per hour. With wellbore drilled throughout the target window sample showed many changes typically consisting of; SILTSTONE: Gray brown, medium gray, gray, light brown, off white, dark gray, microcrystalline, sucrosic, calcareous to siliceous cementation, dolomitic, trace pyrite, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, dull even blue scattered pale yellow ﬂuorescence, slow diffuse cloudy white cut. <br/>Continuing to drill ahead past 17,500’ MD to 18,500’ MD wellbore was drilled throughout the drilling target window. The formation leveled off, and it was decided at 7,500’ VS to lower target inclination 90.5 to 90.2 degrees. Gas was between 145 to 400 units with slight increases for connections. Gamma was between 95 to 137 API units. Rates of penetration were from 250 to 450 feet per hour while drilling. The typical sample was; SILTSTONE: Gray, medium gray, light gray brown, cream gray, light brown, dark gray, off white, microcrystalline, sucrosic, calcareous cementation, dolomitic, scattered pyrite, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, dull blue white fluorescence, slow weak yellow cut. <br/>From 18,500’ MD to 19,500’ MD correlations suggested formation was now up-dip at around 90.1 — 90.2 degrees. Wellbore continued to stay above the center of the drilling target window. During this time gas was between 175 to 425 units with increases for connections. Gamma continued to average 104 — 134 API units, suggesting that we were staying in the same part of the structure. Rate of penetration at this interval was between 200 to 390 feet per. Latest interpretations showed well was several feet below the clean gamma marker at the top of the geologic zone of interest. Samples remained unchanged, and they typically were consisting of; SILTSTONE: Medium gray, gray, dark gray, light brown, cream gray, off white, microcrystalline, platy, calcareous cementation, dolomitic, trace calcite, trace pyrite, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, dull blue yellow ﬂuorescence, slow yellow white cloudy cut. The use of Enviro-Torq used to minimize torque and anti-foam agents, altered any potential oil shows. <br/>Over the last 1,000’ of lateral, penetration rates continued to averaged 250 — 300 ft/hr, total gas averaged 850 — 1,200 units and gamma was still consistently averaging 110 — 1205 API. Formation dip appeared to once again be ﬂat to slightly toe-up at 90.0 — 90.2 degrees with wellbore slowly driﬁ‘ing up in formation and finishing several feet above the center of the geologic zone of interest. Final depth of the Middle Bakken lateral was reached at 20,619’ MD on February 15, 2015at 9:41 am CST. A projection to bit showed wellbore ﬁnished approximately 3’ above the center of the geologic zone of interest. </p>

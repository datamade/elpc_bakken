    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Conclusion <br/>The SC-Norma-LE-l54-98-0706H-l was drilled as a north Middle Bakken lateral in the Truax ﬁeld. As the structure map indicated and past wells in the area had shown, formation dip was expected to change several times throughout the lateral. Dip was expected to be mostly ﬂat through the beginning portion of the lateral and then transition to a slight toe-up through the middle portion, while the last few thousand feet was expected to once again flatten. Average dip rate was expected to be around 90.29 degrees over the entire lateral. <br/>Gamma signature and correlations were fair to good and target was adjusted as needed throughout the lateral. Formation dip for the ﬁnal 2,000’ was estimated at 90.1 to 89.8 degrees, similar to the way other wells on the pad had ﬁnished. Even though formation dip changed several times throughout the lateral, overall wellbore position was estimated to be near the center of the geologic zone of interest for the majority of the lateral. <br/>Lithology made several color transitions as wellbore moved down, through the zone and then back up into geologic zone. Samples typically showed light gray to light gray brown dolomitic siltstone with dull blue yellow ﬂuorescence and a slow weak cut. Through most of the lateral, total gas typically averaged around 250 — 1,500 units with increases at connections. Well was drilled at an average target inclination of 90.34 degrees with average formation dip estimated at 9022 degrees for the entire lateral. Upon reaching total depth of the lateral it was estimated well was drilled 98% in zone. <br/>Jared Bryl T 0m Osadc/zuk Wei/site Geologists </p>

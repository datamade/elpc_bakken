    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The divert oil tanks, labeled on the Process Flow Diagram, are intended to receive diverted oil from the LACT units. The LACT units will begin diverting oil when a BS&W (Basic Sediment & Water) standard is not met. The divert tanks are plumbed in parallel to allow for the LACT to divert to one tank while the other tank is isolated. The isolation is important when trying to clean up bad oil because however much oil gets sent back through a treater will end up getting metered twice, once the first time through and again when sent back through the treater. To compensate for this, the volume of oil diverted will be measured (by gauge) and noted before being sent back through the treater. The volume of diverted oil can then be subtracted from its respective oil meter upstream of the LACT unit. The re-treatment of oil back through the treater is intended to remove whatever contaminants were carried into the well’s dedicated oil tanks. <br/>The divert tanks will not be pumped off to re-treatment until such time has allowed the liquid phases to separate and form the interface from which the interfacial height, along with the overall liquid column height, can be determined. A method of doing this would be taking an initial divert oil liquid height by gauge, starting the recycle pump, and re-gauging the tank when oil enters the recycle pump. By subtracting the two liquid heights minus the volume of the suction piping to the recycle pump, the volume of the water and a volume of the oil can be determined manually. <br/>Because a batch of bad oil commingles with good oil immediately before reaching the LACT unit, an unknown amount of good oil has presumably been contaminated by bad oil and will accompany the bad oil into divert and the re-treatment process. For this reason, the re-treated oil must be allocated to all of the wells in producing into the LACT unit based on recent production percentages for each well. in practice, this contamination is rare, as lease operating staff is responsible for maintaining sellable oil. </p>

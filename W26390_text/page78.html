This location also ﬁts within the Seasonal Operations window we have established with the Little Missouri State Park to avoid disruption to <br/>summer ’lOUl’lStS. <br/>Pad T is a new tri—well pad located in the NIB/4 of Section 26E Tl47N-R95W. This pad will include the CCU Bumer 41—26TFH, CCU Burner 41-26MBH and CCU North Coast l l~25TFHg these wells are scheduled to be drilled early in 2014. <br/>Pad U was initially a dual well pad in the SW/4 of Section 31, Tl48N-R95W. This pad was relocated to the SW/4 of Section 18, Tl47N-R95W and it was converted into a quad pad to accommodate TF wells. This pad was moved in order to mitigate environmental risk of having a well location on the drainage path of the Little Missouri River. This location has been reviewed by a state inspector. The wells on this pad are the CCU Pullman l4~7TFH, CCU Pullman l47MBl-l, CCU Pullman 24-7TFH and the CCU Pullman 24-7MBH; these wells are scheduled to be drilled in 2014. <br/>Pad V was initially a dual well pad in the NW/4 of Section 5, Tl47N—R95W. This pad was relocated to the SE/4 of Section l8, Tl47N—R95W and it was converted into a quad pad to accommodate TF wells. This pad was moved in order to mitigate environmental risk of having a well location on the drainage path of the Little Missouri River. This location has been reviewed by a state inspector. The wells on this pad are the CCU Pullman 34—7TFH, CCU Pullman 347MBI-l, CCU Pullman 44—7TFH and the CCU Pullman 44-7MB H; these wells are scheduled to be <br/>drilled in 2014. </p>

It was moved so it could be closer to HWY 22 in an effort to minimize surface disturbance. The wells on this pad are CCU Red River 24-9MBH, CCU Red River 34—9TFH and CCU Red River 34—9MBH; these wells are scheduled to be drilled in early <br/>2014. </p>

Construction of the CTB was completed in 2012. <br/>The location of the CCU Powell CTB #2 was initially on the border of Sections 28 and 29, T147N-R95W and was moved west to the NW/4 of Section 29, Tl47N—R95 W closer to the existing lease road in an effort to minimize surface disturbance and better serve the surrounding well pads.

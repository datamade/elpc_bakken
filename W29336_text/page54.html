    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Miller 14-12H is a Middle Bakken well laterally drilled by Unit 120 for Whiting Oil and Gas Corp. (API# 33—105—03740) and is located at Section 12 T156N R97W, 630’ FSL & 700’ FWL in Williams County, North Dakota. The well was spudded on January 18, 2015. A total measured depth of 20,027’ MD was reached at 11:30 pm on March 13, 2015. All data is logged by either Jonathan Stoltman, Anthony Samoski, or Jeff Johnson of Neset Consulting Services. Wellsite geological services began at 7,225’ MD above the Tyler Formation on January 22, 2015 at 11:00 pm CST. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Gas monitoring equipment was provided by Neset Consulting Service, using a Total Gas system. </p>

The entire vertical section was drilled with invert mud, and aﬁer intermediate casing the drilling ﬂuid was brine. The average rate of penetration for the vertical section of the well was 54 feet per hour. The vertical section ended at the kick off point of the curve, a measured depth of 9,524’ on January 26, 2015. <br/>Tyler 7,2 72 ’ MD 7,2 70 ’ TVD -5, 006’ SS <br/>Shortly after logging began the top of the Tyler Formation was reached. It was encountered at a measured depth of 7,272’ and a true vertical depth of 7,270’. The top of the Tyler is identiﬁed by a sharp increase in the gamma ray response, followed by a sudden decrease. Typical samples consisted of: SILALE: Red, tan red, reddish brown, silty, very ﬁne grained, anhydrite, limestone cementation, interbedded dolomite, light to medium gray, microcrystalline, no visible porosity, scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, very weak cloudy cut. These samples included trace amounts of anhydrite and light gray limestone. </p>

A sudden decrease in gamma ray response is the main identiﬁer for the Kibbey Lime, quickly dropping from 50-60 API to slightly under 10 API. API values staying fairly consistent and rose to 20 API over the next roughly 40 feet. The Kibbey Lime consists of varying amounts of light to medium gray limestone, reddish brown siltstone, and off </p>

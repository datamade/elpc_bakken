The gamma ray response signature is very difficult to correlate above the 3 ’ set line because the values are highly variable. Overall the samples are very clean with gamma values between the high 20’s and low 40’s API but stringers oﬁen spike gamma ray values up to the 80’s API, making the overall signature very ratty and difﬁcult to decipher. The wellbore stayed above the target window for about 1,100’ feet. While above the window the lateral reached its minimum true vertical depth of 10,100.66’, at a measured depth of 13,717’. At this point the wellbore was about 5.5’ feet from the top of the target window, this would be the furthest the wellbore strayed for the entire lateral section. Above the window samples typically were: SILTSTONE: Light cream tan, light tan, light gray, cream, light to medium gray tan, sub rounded to sub angular, ﬁne to very ﬁne, soft to ﬁrm, calcareous, slightly dolomitic, argillaceous, poor intergranular porosity, dull scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, very weak cloudy cut. <br/>The wellbore was turned around and descended towards the target window. To make sure that the wellbore would not enter the window too steeply, it was ﬂattened out brieﬂy about 2’ from the window and then turned down slightly before traveling parallel along the top of the window until roughly 14,900’ MD. At 15,000’ MD the formation dip was changed to 90°, from here the dip rose gradually to a maximum of 904° at 16,000’ MD and was back to 90° at 17,000°. Formation dip was right around horizontal <br/>until 19,000’ MD where it was changed to 89.78°, which would remain until the end of the well. <br/>Aﬁer entering the window there it descended through the target window reaching an inclination on 89.010 on its way down. The wellbore was turned around as it reached the bottom of the window. From here to the end of the well the direction drillers kept the path of the well in the target window, with a maximum inclination of 92.02° and a minimum inclination of 88.27°. The projection to bit placed the end of the wellbore right above the bottom of the window, with a true vertical depth of 10,115.31’, at a measured depth of 20,027’. Samples at the end of the well consisted of: SILTSTONE: Light to medium cream tan, light tan, very light brown, light gray, light gray tan, ﬁne to very ﬁne, subrounded to subangular, calcareous, slightly dolomitic, argillaceous in part, poor intergranular porosity, faint even yellow to orange ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy cut. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The Miller 14—12H reached its ﬁnal destination at a MD of 20,027’ and TVD of 10,115.31’ at 11:30 pm on March 13, 2015. The well is currently awaiting completion. <br/>Jonathan Stoltman and Anthony Sarnoski Wellsile Geologists </p>

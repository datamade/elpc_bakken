    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Lateral 10, 704’ — 20,295 ’ MD <br/>Due to a hardline requirement and the well’s surface location, intermediate casing was not set at the end of the curve. After landing the curve, bottoms up was circulated, and a trip was performed to pick up a lateral assembly, including an 8% inch Ulterra U616M bit, Baker Ultra XL/MS 6% mud motor, and MWD tools were picked up and tripped in the hole. The lateral section of the wellbore began at 12:00 AM CST on February 4”, 2015. <br/>The Sanish ﬁeld targeting methodology was used for the duration of the lateral wellbore. A nine foot targeting window was used, with the top of the window initially set at 10,256 feet true vertical depth at 10,415 feet measured depth, and projected at an anticipated dip rate of 90.55 degrees. The target line was set six feet below the top, with the base of the window an additional three feet below the target. The observed dip rate of the lateral varied, averaging between 90.45 and 90.7 degrees. The wellbore remained within the D facies for the duration of the lateral, making proper dip determinations difﬁcult, as gamma changes were very slight. <br/>Lateral drilling began at 12:00 AM CST on February 4, 2015. Drill rates while rotating averaged between 60 and 80 feet per hour, and 15 to 20 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 358 units. The wellbore remained within the target window for the duration of the day, with an anticipated dip rate of 90.55 degrees. <br/>Through the full drilling day of the 4TH of February, drill rates continued to average between 60 and 80 feet per hour while rotating, and from 20 to 30 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas decreased slightly to an average of 245 units. Drilling paused between 8 and 9 AM CST while a leaky seal on the stand pipe was repaired. The wellbore exited the top of the target window following 11,150 feet measured depth, following corrective slides, the wellbore reentered the target window at 11,670 feet measured depth. Anticipated dip rate remained 90.55 degrees. <br/>On the 5TH of February, 2015, drill rates while rotating averaged between 50 and 70 feet per hour, and from 5 to 10 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 305 units. The wellbore remained within the target window for the duration of the drilling day, descending to near the base of the window. No signiﬁcant gamma markers were observed, and anticipated dip rate remained 90.55 degrees. <br/>Drilling continued through the 6TH of February, with drill rates while rotating averaged 40 to 50 feet per hour. Background gas averaged 273 units. Drilling was again paused between 7:30 and 9:30 AM CST to replace the saver sub, and swap a washed out joint of pipe. Aﬁer drilling resumed, the wellbore remained near the base of the target window, ascending to the middle of the window into the morning of the 7m. Anticipated dip rate remained 90.55 degrees, with no correlative gamma markers observed. <br/>On the 7TH of February, 2015, drilling continued through 7:00 AM CST, when the intermediate casing point was reached, at 12,863 feet measured depth, with the wellbore in the middle of the target window. Alter circulating bottoms up, a short trip was performed to above the top of the Charles salts, and back to bottom. The drill string was tripped out, laying down 5 inch pipe. <br/>Seven inch casing was run and set at 12,843 feet measured depth and cemented into place. Bit number six, a Baker T406 and directional BHA were picked up and tripped in the hole. On the morning of the 9TH of February, 2015, the ﬂoat and cement were drilled, and a casing pressure test was successfully completed. The shoe and ten feet of open formation were drilled, and a formational integrity test was successﬁilly performed. </p>

    <p class="styleSans31.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The US Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has received a proposal to authorize land use for Two Bakken and Three Forks Oil Wells Located on One Well Pad on the Fort Berthoid Reservation. <br/>The well pad would be located approximately 3 miles east of Mandaree in the SE% NE‘A Section 7, Township 149 North, Range 93 West, Dunn County, North Dakota, within a 1,280-acre spacing unit. This location would contain the following wells: <br/>0 Snow #149-93-7A-12H o Rain #l49-93-7A-l2l—l TF <br/>Associated federal actions by BIA include determinations of impacts and effects regarding environmental resources for developments on tribal lands. <br/>The potential of the proposed actions to impact the human environment is analyzed in the attached addendum to an existing EA, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act. Based on the recently completed addendum to the EA, 1 have determined that the proposed project will not signiﬁcantly affect the quality of the human environment. No Environmental Impact Statement is required for any portion of the proposed activities. <br/>This determination is based on the following factors: <br/>1. Agency and public involvement solicited for the preceding NEPA document was sufﬁcient to ascertain potential environmental concerns associated with the currently proposed project. <br/>2. Protective and prudent measures were designed to minimize impacts to air, water, soil, vegetation, wetlands, wildlife, public safety, water resources, and cultural resources. The remaining potential for impacts was disclosed for both the proposed actions and the No Action alternative. <br/>3. Guidance from the US. Fish and Wildlife Service has been fully considered regarding wildlife impacts, particularly in regard to threatened or endangered species. This guidance includes the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 432l et seq.), the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668d, 54 Stat. 250), Executive Order l3186 “Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds”, and the Endangered Species Act (l6 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). <br/>4. The proposed actions are designed to avoid adverse effects to historic, archaeological, cultural and <br/>traditional properties, sites and practices. Compliance with the procedures of the National Historic Preservation Act is complete. <br/>5 Environmental justice was fuin considered. <br/>6 Cumulative effects to the environment are either mitigated or minimal. <br/>7. N0 regulatory requirements have been waived or require compensatory mitigation measures. 8 <br/>The proposed projects will improve the socio—economic condition of the affected Indian community. <br/>y/J/W <br/>Date <br/>  </p>

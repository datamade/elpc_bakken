Here shale samples were generally dull black to very dark gray and very dark brown, blocky, ﬁssile, carbonaceous, spotted dark yellow to dark green to black ﬂuorescence, with instant to fast blooming milky cuts. <br/>The curve section landed in the Middle Bakken at an 8520" angle at 9,700' MD/9,363.00’ TVD on November 19, 2014 at 12:40 AM CST. The ﬁnal curve TD depth of 9,700’ MD was conﬁrmed when the bottoms up sample at this depth contained light bluish gray Middle Bakken dolomite with trace amounts of very dark gray to black shale slough off. <br/>Horizontal Section </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">After the intermediate casing shoe was set to 9,697’ MD, drilling began in the horizontal section at 12:40 AM CST on November 20, 2014. The Middle Bakken top was ofﬁcially determined at 9,678’ MD/—7,457’ SS from a decrease in gamma values as the gamma tool transitioned from the UBS into the Middle Bakken dolomite. The curve was generally leveled off within the drilling window at a ~90° angle near measured depth of 10,900’ MD, and the GR Marker was ﬁrst encountered at 9,933’ MD/-7,468’ SS. The formation dip angle from 9,700’ — 10,700’ MD averaged 90 degrees, and from 10,700’ - 14,500’ MD averaged 90.15 degrees. Then the formation ﬂattened out with a slight down clip from 14,500” — 15,150’ MD, then slightly dipped upward from 15,150 — 15,650’ MD. <br/>Middle Bakken 9,678 ’ MD 9,361 ’ T VD -7,45 7’ SS GR Marker 9,933 ’ MD 9,3 72 ’ TVD -7,468’ SS <br/>The ﬁrst section of the horizontal for Parshall 88-3029H was drilled from the landing target window of9,375 — 9385’ TVD set at 9,700’ MD, to Way Point 1, set at 1 1,000’ MD, with a target window of 9,375 — 9,385 ’ TVD. Within Way Point 1, the GR Marker was encountered for the second time at 10,647’ MD/-7,469’ SS. Between the landing target and Way Point 1, drilling involved sliding to make an azimuth turn from approximately 120 degrees to approximately 136 degrees, which was accomplished near 11,000’ MD. </p>

The third and ﬁnal horizontal section of Parshall 883029H was set to Way Point 3TD at 15,830’ MD, with a target window of 9,360 — 9,370’ TVD. Within Way Point 3TD, the GR Marker was encountered for the third, fourth, and ﬁfth times at 14,302’ MD/-7,458’ SS, 15,130’ MD/-7,463’ SS, and 15,437’ MD/—7,462’ SS respectively. The Upper Bakken Shale was encountered at 15,636’ MD/-7,450’ SS after the decision was made to rotate out after sliding became ineffective near the end of the well, and TD was reached within Way Point 3TD with the bit approximately 14’ into the Upper Bakken Shale at 15,650’ MD. All Way Points were published by Tony Rios of EOG Resources. <br/>GR Marker 14,302’ MD 9,362’ TVD -7,458’ SS GR Marker 15,130’ MD 9,367’ TVD -7,463’SS GR Marker 15,437’ MD 9,366’ TVD -7,462’ SS </p>

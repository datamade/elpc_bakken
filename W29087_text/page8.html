Discussion was held with the directional company personnel to proceed with caution and away from the Van Hook 1-13H well (which resulted in drilling in a southerly direction). During drilling operations over the next 24 hours the well bore was drilled attempting to get build rates to land the well at 84“ 1-2 feet into the Middle Bakken and attain a legal setback for the 7" casing shoe. Dog legs were generated in the range of 15—21“ attempting to drill the well per plan (that is at 150° azimuth and to land the well at 84°). Several phone conversations were held with rig personnel during this time monitoring the operations. The BHA was considered to be the strongest building BHA with a tri-cone bit. The Middle Bakken was drilled into and the projected angle at TD wasjust 69° and the Bottom Hole Location was 123 feet West of the 500 foot setback, thus an illegal location. Both ofthese measurements result in the request to sidetrack the well. <br/>Plan Forward <br/>EOG plans to set a Smith open hole whip stock at a depth of 8,940 feet, 60 feet above the original KOP of 9,000 feet. With tubing tail pipe to TD, 9,627 feet, a cement plug will be set from TD to a planned top of 8,740 feet, or 200 feet above the whip stock. The cement plug will effectively plug the open hole from TD to the whip stock. The 200 feet of cement above the whip stock will be dressed off and the well will be sidetracked at a depth of 8,940 feet. From there the curve will be drilled with plans to tie back into the original directional plan of an azimuth of 150° and 7" casing set at least 500 feet from the West line of Section 13 or at least 196 feet East of the surface location. </p>

No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface caslng. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and easing plan as per the APD.

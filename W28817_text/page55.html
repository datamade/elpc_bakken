    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">SANDSTONE: Light gray to light gray brown, brown to tan, cream tan, very ﬁne to ﬁne, subrounded to subangular, moderately sorted, argillaceous, fair calcareous to dolomitic cementation, trace siltstone, light gray to gray, fair induration, fair intergranular porosity, fair brown oil stain, even yellow green ﬂuorescence, fair milky cut <br/>The oil shows varied from weak to fair milky cuts, with even dull to bright yellow green ﬂuorescence throughout Lateral. Gas ranged from 11 - 7189 units with an average of 547 units throughout the lateral. A 1’-10’ ﬂare was observed while drilling the lateral and a 15’-20’ ﬂare while circulating out trip gas. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The Simpson 151-102-5-8-1H Lateral reached a total depth of 20,809’ MD on November 19, 2014 at 12:45 PM MST. The bottom hole location was projected at MD 20809 / INC 89.30/AZ 178.50/TVD 10886.54/VS 10143.53. The Gamma ranged from 63 - 107 API with average of 84 API. Gas averaged 547 units throughout the lateral. The lateral section was drilled 100% in the Middle Bakken formation with poor to moderate intergranular porosity seen throughout the lateral, light to fair brown oil staining in samples, and weak to fair milky cuts and even dull to bright yellow green ﬂuorescence. The indications of good gases, a ﬂare 1—10 feet observed while drilling, and fair oil shows in the lithology while drilling indicate this well will be a good oil producer. The Simpson 151-102-5-8-1H will be awaiting completion to go online producing oil. </p>

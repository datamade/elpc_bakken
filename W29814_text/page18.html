Repositioning of the target zone and an inaccurate bit projection placed the wellbore near center of the 8 foot window as it exited casing. The lateral began with a planned 34° turn to an azimuth of 180° south. Through this interval the wellbore tracked low to center of the initial target, projected at an estimated 90.15°. Accumulated gas circulated up reached over 3,000 total units before settling in at a background average of 480 total units. Cuttings sampled represented the sedimentary dolomite lithology expected and produced strong shows of petroleum in ﬂuorescence under ultraviolet light and when cut with solvent. <br/>The directional turn was completed by measured depth 12,650 feet and allowed for and increased drill rate. By measured depth 13,000 feet the wellbore was still tracking low within zone when a new target was calculated and applied. The change shifted the zone up three feet and applied a new angle of 902°. The wellbore continued to easily track the target both above and below its center for the next 1,600 feet at which time the angle was increased to 903°. This leg of the lateral continued as the previous, having the same dolomitic lithology with increased amounts of clastic, detrital sediment lower in the column. The dolomitic cuttings continued their strong shows of petroleum, as gas values were also maintained mid-way through the lateral. <br/>Approaching measured depth 15,000 and as the targeted angle was raised to 903°, the wellbore began to rise and track zone high within the 8 foot target. Samples became notably less clastic, lighter in color and demonstrated stronger shows of hydrocarbons. The interval also produced a marked increase in gas which reached a peak of3, 100 total units. The brush with the upper portion of zone lasted roughly 200-3 00 feet. Changing lithology and lighter petroleum shows were noted as the wellbore lowered within the target. A more sustained occupation of the top half of the target was eventually achieved out at measured depth 16,500 feet. <br/>Throughout the lateral the tool assembly had a tendency to drop in inclination while rotating. This behavior made wellbore placement, high in zone, not just difﬁcult but increased risks of a strike with the upper shale. As the formation ﬂattened to 900° from measured depth 16,500 to 18,500 feet, tracking the top half of the window became less of a threat. Tracking the target’s upper extent over most of this interval returned the same increased petroleum shows associated with the same clean, tan and occasionally translucent dolomite lithology as seen previously. Average gas values rose to over 1,300 total units as cuttings from the same depths produced stronger ﬂuorescence and streams when cut. <br/>Falling below the middle of the target was again associated with a decrease of hydrocarbon shows as the wellbore passed measured depth 17,500 feet. The lowering inclination took the wellbore out the bottom of the target window and would not recover a position within until past measured depth 18,600 feet. Sharp, intermittent gas spikes of 1,500 feet began to characterize the center of the target window when the wellbore began to track this position from </p>

The limited amount of Charles formation logged produced an average gas value of over 250 total units and unremarkable shows of petroleum. The BLS marker came in at the vertical position where it had been expected, lending credibility the adjusted landing target. </p>

Lagged samples were interpreted as altered layers of dolomite within a thick bed of limestone, ranging in colors of tan, brown, light brown, gray to light gray, and cream. The composition eventually gave way to unaltered limestone. The deposits were crystalline to microcrystalline, slightly argillaceous and having little, to no visible porosity, Fluorescence and cut were week in cuttings sampled while gas values maintained their previous average just below 300 total units. </p>

Since it also came in at the vertical position expected, the Lodgepole top did not suggest any change to the previously adjusted landing target 11,171 feet true vertical depth. Still high within the Lodgepole formation, the kick-off point for the curve was reached at measured depth 10,655 feet on December 7‘”, 2014 at 10: 15 am CT. Following a <br/>trip to surface for the curve building assembly, drilling of the curve began that same evening at 9:00 pm CT. </p>

Shows of petroleum ranged from good to poor with most samples described by the latter. The upper Lodgepole had weak shows with an overall low gas values that averaged 200 total units. In the lower portions of the Lodgepole, slight increases to over 400 total units were recorded. Stronger petroleum shows in the cuttings from the same depth were also noted. <br/>Gamma markers of the lower Lodgepole were indicating that the Bakken’s position would be lower than previously expected. A new landing target of 11,175 feet true vertical depth was calculated and applied. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">measured depth 19,500 feet. At this stage in the lateral, the formation was calculated to be lying at an angle of 90.42°. Efforts to hold the wellbore within the top half of zone were being met with more success as it tracked above center out to measured depth 20,400 feet. A sudden loss of inclination and vertical depth coincided with a motor failure at measured depth 20,395 feet. The result was a trip to surface on December 14‘“, 2014 starting at 1:35 am CT. Lateral drilling resumed at 6:45 pm CT later that same evening. <br/>Drilling resumed with one last, successful effort to bring the tool assembly above the 90.420 dip angle and into the upper extent of the 8 foot window. The wellbore returned signiﬁcant increases in gas values as it cut along the top line of the projected windowi Samples returning had become poor in quality and low in quantity. The low grade cuttings were generally of the lithology expected from the top half of zone. The aggressive cleaning of the cuttings from these depths left no residual hydrocarbons behind for visual identiﬁcation. The last contact with the top line of the target was followed by a sharp drop in inclination and eventual exit out the bottom of the target zone. </p>

The wellbore ended low to the 8 foot target window that had been most recently projected at 9042". The target and formation had risen 60 feet over the course of the entire lateral. The wellbore is estimated to have occupied the 8 foot target window for 93% of the lateral. <br/>The lithology of the cuttings recovered indicated a heavily clastic, detrital sand/siltstone, darker in color and bioturbated in the lower portions of the middle Bakken. The upper extent of the member was represented by a tan and occasionally translucent dolomite that lacked any signiﬁcant amounts of sedimentary material. Notable to strong shows of hydrocarbons were identiﬁed throughout the entire lateral. The strongest of the shows were produced while drilling in the top half of the target window, within the more pure dolomite, and closer to the upper Bakken shale. <br/>John Nygard Wei/site Geologist </p>

The State 154-102-25-36— 10TFH was spudded on November 10, 2014 with surface drilled and cased to be resumed at a later date. Patterson 320 spudded the State 154—102-25-36-10TFH on December 25, 2014 and reached a total depth of 20,309’ MD on February 2, 2015. Wellsite geological services began at 8,600 on December 27, 2014 at 3: 15 PM MST. The initial phase of the State 154-102-25-36-10TFH is a vertical and curve landing in the Three Forks Formation on December 31, 2014. The single lateral well targeting the Three Forks Formation approximately 7’-14’ below the base of the Lower Bakken Dolomite was started on January 25, 2015. Thirty-foot samples were collected throughout the vertical and curve with ﬁﬁy foot samples collected in the lateral. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 8, 600’ — 10,3 75’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 8,600’ MD in the Charles/Madison formation on December 27, 2014 at 3: 15 PM MST. Gas detection system was tested before logging depth with system functioning correctly. Drill rates before encountering the Base Last Salt ranged from 011-727 minutes per foot and averaging 1.07 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 17-62 units averaging 36 units. A typical sample was: HALITE: Clear, translucent, frosty, jagged, trace siltstone, dark red, light red, chalky, argillaceous in part, trace limestone, poor to fair induration, trace imbedded white anhydrite, mineral ﬂuorescence, fair cloudy cut. </p>

Drill rates below the Base of the Last Salt ranged from 05—328 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 0.81 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 28-62 units averaging 45 units. A typical sample was: LIMESTONE: Light brown gray, light brown, light gray, gray, micro-crystalline, argillaceous, carbonaceous, dolomitic, moderate to well induration, poor intergranular porosity, trace anhydrite, even yellow green fluorescence, fast yellow cloudy cut. <br/>Mission Canyon 9, 446’ MD 9,422 ’ T VD -7,275 ’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was picked 7 feet higher than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and differential pressure. Drill rates in the Mission Canyon formation ranged from 0.21—4.53 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 0.77 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 28-90 units averaging 43 units.

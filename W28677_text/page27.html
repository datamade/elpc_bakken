The surface location of this well is located on the SW SW corner of Section 33 Township 151N Range 92W, in Mountrail County, North Dakota. The bottom-hole location is in the SW SE comer of Section 9 Township 150N Range 92W, 249.96’ ﬁom the South line (F SL), and 1,862.64’ from the East line (FEL). <br/>The Roggenbuck 4-9HY spud on September 4th, 2014. Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided services that began on September 14‘“, 2014, which included mud log creation, sample descriptions, gas monitoring, and geologic steering. Gas monitoring equipment was provided and maintained by Pason Systems Corporation. Lagged samples were caught through the vertical and curve sections at 30’ intervals, and the lateral section at 100' intervals. Reached a Target Depth of 21,375’ MD on September 24th, 2014 at 2:30 PM CST. <br/>Curve 10,450’ — 11,313’ MD <br/>Kicked—Off at 3:30 PM CST on September 14“, 2014, at 10,450’ MD, 9,916' TVD. Drilling rates in the Lodgepole through the curve ranged from 0.5 to 9 minutes per foot. Gas levels remained near 12 units for the entire curve. Pason Gas was called out but did not am've <br/>for maintenance before the end of the curve. All Lodgepole markers consistently correlated within 6’ of the target landing of 10,385’ TVD. </p>

Reached the end of curve Target Depth of 11,313' Ivﬂ) at 11 AM CST on September 15m, 2014. The 7” casing was set at 11,293’ MD on September 17m, 2014. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Samples through the curve consisted of Limestone with scattered interbedded gray Shale through the Lodgepole formation, changing to carbonaceous earthy black Shale through the Upper and Lower Bakken Shale formations, and ending with ﬁne grained Mudstone with scattered sucrosic Dolomite within the Three Forks formation. The curve was landed at an azimuth of 179.12°, and a depth of 10,391.48’ TVD. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 10,890’ MD 10,238’ TVD -8,186’ ss <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was entered at a depth of 10,890’ MD, 10,238’ TVD, which correlated to a landing of 10,383’ TVD. The Upper Bakken Shale was identiﬁed by observing a rapid and extreme increase in gamma API, going from 20 API to over 400 API, along with a slight ROP increase ﬁom 1.5 to 0.5 minutes per foot. The Shale formation was conﬁrmed by collecting and identifying samples consisting of earthy, blocky, carbonaceous dark brown to black Shale, with trace light gray interbedded Limestone, no ﬂuorescence, and an instant thick streaming milky cut. </p>

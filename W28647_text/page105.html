    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">2 high side slides were put in at 12,255’ MD and 15,910’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. Drilling would continue in the lower portion of the target window until a high side slide was put in at 16,735’ MD that would send the wellbore back into the clean “B” facies at 16,899’ MD. This encounter would indicate a slight ﬂattening in the formation to 89.37 degrees. <br/>4 downslides were put in starting at 16,985’MD to counter the rise seen in the formation. These slides would send the wellbore back down in the formation and through the BIG contact at 17,737 ’ MD. This encounter would conﬁrm the projected dip rate of 89.43 degrees. A deﬂection up was taken shortly after this encounter would send the wellbore rising back into the clean “B” facies at 17,853’ MD. This encounter would indicate a steepening in the formation to 89.23 degrees. <br/>2 downslides were put in at 17,995’ MD to send the wellbore back down in the formation. These slides would send the wellbore through the BIG contact at 18,367 ’ MD. This encounter would indicate a steepening in the formation to 89.08 degrees. <br/>A high side slide was put in at 18,467 ’ MD to level the wellbore off. This slide as well as a deﬂection up at 18,706’ MD would send the wellbore rising in the formation. This rise would send the wellbore into the clean “B” facies at 18,915’ MD. This encounter would indicate a steepening in the formation to 89.29 degrees. <br/>6 downslides were put in starting at 19,017’ MD to send the wellbore dropping in the formation. The steepening in the formation and the rise in the wellbore would send it into the “A” faices at 19,236’ MD. The wellbore would re-enter the clean “B” facies at 19,703’ MD and continue dropping in the formation. <br/>This drop would send the wellbore through the base of the clean “B” facies at 20,248’ MD. This encounter with the BIG contact would indicate a signiﬁcant steepening to an average of 89. 15 degrees for this section. The wellbore would deﬂect up shortly aﬁer this encounter and re-enter the clean “B” facies at 20,315’ MD. <br/>The remainder of the well was drilled in rotation in the clean “B” facies to the TD of 20,475’ MD, reached at 1:30 AM CDT on November 1 1, 2014. </p>

Total depth of 20,160' MD; 10,375.46' TVD; 1,046.07' VS reached at 2120 hrs MST 22 Dec 2014. <br/>Meredith Remmich, Alan Chappell of Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided geological services from a measure depth of 7,450’. One set of samples was collected in thirty foot intervals for the vertical and curve, and in one hundred foot intervals during the lateral. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Pason Gas Detection was utilized for gas detection, <br/>VERTICAL / CURVE WELLBORES 7,450’ -— 10, 745’ MD <br/>Drilling <br/>An oil-based mud system was used in the vertical and curve wellbores. <br/>Logging began at 1325 hrs MST 13 Dec 2014 ﬁom 7,450’ MD in the Amsden Formation. TOOH due to low ROP from 8,098' MD at 2130 hrs MST 13 Dec 2014; resumed drilling vertical wellbore at 0430 hrs MST 14 Dec 2014. TOOH for curve assembly from 9,850' MD at 2355 hrs MST 14 Dec 2014; resumed drilling and began building the curve at 0950 hrs MST 15 Dec 2014. The target was set at 10,383’ TVD, 10’ into the Middle Bakken. Curve ROP averaged 1.0 min/ﬂ (60 feet per hour) and total gas averaged 150 units with a peak recorded reading of 685 units. The Middle Bakken TVD target window was established as an 8’ window, with the target top 5’ below the Upper Bakken Shale and the target bottom 7’above the Lower Bakken Shale, with a total Middle Bakken Member thickness estimated at 20’. <br/>7” casing was set at 10,734’ MD and cemented. <br/>F ORAlA T IONS Tyler 7,521 ’ MD 7,519’ TVD -5,600’ SS <br/>The Tyler Formation was observed at 7,521 ’ MD (7,519’ TVD; -5,600’ SS), 23’ higher than the prognosis. The Tyler top was identiﬁed by GR signature and rate of penetration (ROP). ROP averaged 0.6 minutes per foot (100 feet/hour). Background gas averaged 40 units and a peak reading of 130 units was recorded. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Tyler Formation. <br/>LIMESTONE: Rust red, scattered black and white grains; calcareous, silty, moderate porosity, moderate induration; little to no ﬂuorescence, pale white slow cut. </p>

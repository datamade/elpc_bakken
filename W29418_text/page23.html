The Kibbey Lime marker was picked by the change in ROP and GR signature. ROP through the Kibbey averaged 0.9 minutes per foot (67 feet/hour). Background gas averaged 92 units and a peak reading of 13 units was recorded. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Kibbey Formation. <br/>A representative sample: <br/>LIMESTONE: Light tan, off white to white, trace light brown, trace argillaceous, moderate induration, tight, scattered pale yellow ﬂuorescence, slow clear very pale yellow cut. <br/>Charles 8,240’ MD 8,238’ TVD -6,319’ SS <br/>The Charles Formation was encountered at 8,240’ MD (8,238’ TVD; -6,319’ SS), 9’ lower than the prognosis. The Charles was identiﬁed by ROP, GR signature, and cuttings lithology. ROP through the Charles Formation averaged 0.5 min/ﬂ (120 feet/hr). Background gas averaged 98 units with a peak recorded reading of 134 units. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Charles Formation. <br/>A representative sample: SALT: Clear, hard, massive; trace anhydrite, limestone, shales; no shows. <br/>Base of Last Salt 8,886 ’ MD 8,884 ’ TVD -6,965 ’ SS <br/>The BLS was identiﬁed via rate of penetration, GR signature, and cuttings lithology at 8,886’ MD (8,884’ TVD; -6,965’ SS), 15’ higher than the prognosis. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,099’ MD 9, 097’ TVD -7,178’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon Formation was observed at 9,099’ MD (9,097 ’ TVD; 7,178’ SS), 15’ higher than the prognosis. The Mission Canyon top was identiﬁed via GR signature, ROP, and cuttings lithology. ROP averaged 0.5 minutes per foot (120 feet/hour). Background gas averaged 160 units and a peak reading of 208 units was <br/>recorded. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Mission Canyon Formation. <br/>A representative sample: LIMESTONE: Light tan, cream, carbonaceous, moderate to good induration, poor intergranular porosity, patchy pale yellow ﬂuorescence, rapid cloudy pale yellow cut. <br/>Lodgepole 9,577’ MD 9,575’ TVD - 7,656’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation top was observed at 9,577 ’ MD (9,57 5’ TVD; -7,656’ SS), 20’ higher than the prognosis. It was identiﬁed by GR signature, differential <br/>4 </p>

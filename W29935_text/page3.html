Last good survey was 22775 MD, 12131 N and 979.8 W. They <br/>were in middle of spacing unit so east/west hardlines were not close. They requested to drill to 23212 which was 50' from hardline. I approved to drill to 23150' MD and that would put them at a projected distance of 12505 N and 100' from hardline. <br/>  <br/>  <br/>r.“ w .   t .. m.

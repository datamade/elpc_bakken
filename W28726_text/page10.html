This reflects that for similar crude oils gas volumes in solution within “saturated separator barrels" leaving treaters is primarily a function of separation “ﬂash” conditions and not producing GOR from the well. The coriolis meters at the treaters will be measuring “saturated” separator barrels containing the soon to be liberated tank gas vapor still in solution before finally ﬂashing at tank conditions. <br/>Continuous Measurement: Individual Well “Monthly Well WATER PRODUCTION”: Produced Water: A continuously measured well water meter volume shall be used for individual well produced <br/>water volume. </p>

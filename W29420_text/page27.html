The D facies presented as grayish brown to gray with grayish tan platiness and poor intercrystalline porosity. Tray ﬂuorescence was pale and solvent cut ﬂuorescence presented as slow, clear, and pale yellow to pale greenish yellow. The C facies presented as a lighter brown to brownish gray and also some platiness, however the plates in the C facies tended to be lighter with darker staining than those observed in the D facies. Porosity was also poor. Tray ﬂuorescence was scattered and dull greenish yellow, and solvent cut ﬂuorescence presented as moderately rapid to rapid, cloudy, and pale to dull greenish yellow. The A facies presented as light to medium browns and brownish grays, with some scattered unconsolidated quartz sand. Tray ﬂuorescence was even and dull greenish yellow. Solvent cut ﬂuorescence was rapid, streaming, cloudy dull greenish yellow. <br/>Gas readings in the lateral phase averaged 143 units with a high of 2,468 units. . Please refer to Figure 1 for wellbore schematic with corresponding gas readings. <br/>No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed while drilling the lateral phase <br/>of the wellbore. Please refer to Sample Descriptions or to the mudlogs for individual sample descriptions. <br/>Formation Dip/Inclination </p>

As expected, the formation came up very quickly initially, coming up 30’ of TVD in the ﬁrst 2,500’ of measure dept while making the directional turn, averaging a dip of 90.5 degrees. The formation turned over at 13,300’ MD. The formation continue to move downward until 18,900’ Nﬂ), dropping 26’ of TVD, with the dip averaging 89.5 degrees in that interval. At 18,900’ MD, the formation turned back up and began its predicted upward movement, coming up ~6’ TVD until TD at 21,775’ MD, averaging a dip of 90.4 degrees in that interval.

It was spudded on 02 Nov 2014. The vertical wellbore reached TD of 9,810’ MD (9,809’ TVD). The curve wellbore reached TD at 10,608' MD; 10,393.61' TVD. 7” casing was set at 10,600’ MD. Total depth of21,775' MD; 10,369.24' TVD; 10,023.48' VS reached at 1837 hrs MST 19 Nov 2014. </p>

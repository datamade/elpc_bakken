    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">GR Signature <br/>The GR signature of the D facies was the most reliable marker for steering the wellbore. This GR signature was warm and very consistent, with values ranging from 80 units API to 100 units API. When this signature was observed, slides were implemented to bring the wellbore back in the target window. The GR signature of the C facies (the target window) generally presented as cooler gamma than that below the target in the D, with values ranging from 50 units API to as high as upper 80s API, although a warm peak in the center of the target window read has hot as 100-105 units API. When the wellbore was out the top of the TVD target window and into the A facies, the GR signature was also warm but very inconsistent, giving it a ratty look to it. The GR signature of the A facies was not as consistent or reliable as the C/D contact and slides were implemented to bring the wellbore back in to the clean gamma the C facies when the A facies was observed. <br/>No unexpected gamma values were encountered while drilling the lateral phase of <br/>the wellbore. Please refer to Figure 1 for wellbore schematic with corresponding GR signature </p>

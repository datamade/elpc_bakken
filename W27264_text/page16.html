Volumes of gas will be metered at a dedicated treater (at central facility) using an orifice meter. <br/>2. The total gas volume leaving the central production facility will be metered by custody transfer â€œgas sales" meter prior to delivery into a gas gathering pipeline system. <br/>a. Gas Sales metered volumes for the month are termed "Actual Monthly Gas Sales". <br/>3. Determine a theoretical monthly gas production volume for each continuously measured well as follows: <br/>a. Theoretical Monthly Gas Production = Total gas volume continuously measured for a month with Volume corrected as necessary by responsible operations/metering personnel for known upsets/malfunctioning of equipment or measurement devices that impact accuracy of well gas volumes. <br/>4. Sum all the individual well "Theoretical Monthly Gas Production" volumes to determine the 'Total Theoretical Monthly Gas Production" for the central production facility. <br/>5. Calculate a sales factor by dividing the total "Actual Monthly Gas Sales" by the "Total Theoretical Monthly Gas Production" volumes for the central production facility corrected as necessary for any time well was producing but measurement was not operational. <br/>6. Determine "Allocated Monthly Gas Sales" for each well by multiplying the respective individual well "Theoretical Monthly Gas Production" volume by the sales factor calculated in step (5) above. <br/>7. Gas Sales meter used in the measurement will be calibrated and maintained according to gas gathering contracts with commercial gathering entities and/or industry standard practices if performed by Emerald directly. <br/>8. Well gas allocation meters will be checked and calibrated on a standard times span reflective of gas volume magnitude (large volumes quarterly, lower volumes every 6 months. <br/>9. Volumes will be reported to appropriate agencies through routine gas production reports filed monthly. <br/>Associated Oil Tank Gas (aka. Vapors) Recovered And Sold With Separator Gas: <br/>lf central facility separator gas is 1) active on gas sales system and 2) vapor recovery is required for emissions compliance and/or vapor recovery otherwise economic then a Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU) will be installed to recover tank gas prior to entry into atmospheric tanks. <br/>1. Commingled gas from the discharge of Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU) compressors will be measured and allocated back to the individual wells based upon each well prorated share of continuously measured oil volumes from the treater Coriolis meters and not producing well stream GOR. This reflects that for similar crude oils gas volumes in solution within "saturated separator barrels" leaving treaters is primarily a function of separation "flash" conditions and not producing GOR from the well. The coriolis meters at the treaters will be measuring "saturated" separator barrels containing the soon to be liberated tank gas vapor still in solution before finally flashing at tank conditions. </p>

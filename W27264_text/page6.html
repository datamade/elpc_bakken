Volumes of oil will be metered at a dedicated treater (at central facility) using coriolis meters. 2. The total oil volume leaving the central production facility will be metered by LACT unit prior to trucking oil or entry into an oil gathering pipeline system. a.

Sum all the individual well “Theoretical Monthly Oil Production" volumes to determine the "Total Theoretical Monthly Oil Production" for the central production facility. Calculate a sales factor by dividing the total "Actual Monthly Oil Sales" by the "Total Theoretical Monthly Oil Production" volumes for the central production facility corrected as necessary for any time well was producing but metering was not operational. Determine "Allocated Monthly Oil Production" for each well by multiplying the respective individual well "Theoretical Monthly Oil Production" volume by the sales factor calculated in step (5) above. LACT meter used will be proved according to the section below entitled "Current Emerald Oil Sales LACT Proving". Well oil allocation meters will be proved on a quarterly basis using either a positive displacement proving loop or to a test tank. <br/>Volumes will be reported to appropriate agencies through routine oil production reports filed monthly. <br/>Current Emerald Oil Sales LACT Proving: The time between LACT proving depends on the amount of oil sold through the pipeline/truck LACT <br/>as follows: <br/>1. LACT ships 2,000 bbls or more in a month: LACT pr0ved every month. <br/>2. LACT ships less than 2,000 bbls in a month: LACT is proved every quarter. <br/>3. In addition, to establish a comparative meter factor for a new LACT, the initial proving is <br/>followed by a second proving a month later, regardless of how much oil is shipped through the LACT for that month. </p>

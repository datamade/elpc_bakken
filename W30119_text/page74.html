    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">A sharp rise in the wellbore inclination combined with a sudden change in formation dip resulted in a brief exit out the top of the target widow at measured depth 18,500 feet. The resulting gamma data was used to calculate new target angle of 89.75° and shifted the target down 7 feet at the time of the change. The wellbore was tracing the top line of the new zone by measured depth 19,200 feet and down into the center of the target ﬁve hundred feet past that. The dolomitic lithology in this segment did not deviate from what had been seen previously in the lateral or what was expected at the top of the target. Stronger petroleum shows generally expected from the top half of zone were also noted and seen in the increased gases, now with a 955 total unit average and intervals over 1,200 total units becoming common. </p>

    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Near the end of the lateral segment, a ﬁnal target change was applied from measured depth 20,000 feet. The new estimated angle of 900° shifted the eight foot zone up one foot at the time it was applied. Slide drilling efforts kept the assembly within zone and brought the wellbore back to the target’s top line approaching measured depth 20,600 feet. On January 20th, 2015 at 5:20 pm CT a trip to surface for tools began after a mud motor failure at measured depth 20,685 feet Drilling of the lateral resumed the following day at 10:30 pm CT. One hour and forty ﬁve minutes later on January 215‘, 2015 at 12:15 pm CT total depth of the Shirley Moen 44-34-3H was reached, achieving a measured depth of 20,812 feet and true vertical depth of 11,144 feet. <br/>Completed in just over 14 active drilling days from spud, the Shirley Moen 44-34-3H is a lateral well within the middle member of the Bakken formation. The unofﬁcial estimate places the lateral wellbore within the target for 81% of the horizontal length. The typical geologic makeup of the middle Bakken was present in the form of tan, translucent light brown dolomite and little if any clastic material high within zone. The upper portion of the target also continues the trend of returning better petroleum shows than seen low with zone. One notable difference observed in the lithology includes a declined amount of clastic detrital sediments held within the dolomite of the lower portion of the middle member of the Bakken formation. </p>

The initial sample was a tan dolomite, following samples would also include limestone more dolomite and layers of evaporitic deposits, all of variable thicknesses. The base of the last Charles Salt was initially identiﬁed, using rate of penetration, at 9,576 feet true vertical depth. This marker as well as the depths of all other formations logged were aided by the accuracy of available gamma data. Review of the BLS and other data concluded that no target adjustment was needed. Gas and petroleum shows in the Charles were weak, ranging from 45 to 125 total units. Occasional signs of ﬂuorescence were attributed to the petroleum based drilling ﬂuid. <br/>Mission Canvon 9. 790’ MD 9. 784’ T VD -7.43 7’ SS </p>

Samples began as light brown dolomite and transitioned into limestone ranging in colors of tan, brown, light brown, gray to light gray, and cream. The limestone was consistently crystalline to microcrystalline, with varying amounts and sizes of detrital sediments. Little to fair porosity was noted throughout the formation and petroleum shows in the form of ﬂuorescence and a solvent cut were modest to pronounced. Gas values of the Mission Canyon increased slightly to those seen in the lower Charles and averaged 150 total units. <br/>Lodgepole 1 0,29 7’ MD 10,291 ’ T VD - 7, 944’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Identiﬁed by it’s gamma signature, the top of the Lodgepole formation came in at 10,297 feet measured and a true vertical depth of 10,291 feet. Limestone samples collected across the transition were noted to change in color from brown/light brown to gray. The top of the Lodgepole formation was used to again evaluate the landing target and it also conﬁrmed the previously adjusted mark of 11,140 vertical feet. <br/>Curve 10,616’ —11,470’MD <br/>Soon aﬂer identifying the Lodgepole formation on January 13‘“, 2015 at 12:05 am CT, with a measured depth of 10,464 feet, low rates of penetration resulted in an early trip to surface for the curve assembly. Drilling resumed at 9:30 pm the same night and the kick off point was reached at measured depth 10,616 feet. <br/>Lithology of the Lodgepole was typical for the area. Light brown to light gray brown, occasionally dolomitized and detrital limestone. The occasional clastic inclusions were primarily ﬂocks of gray silt. Petroleum shows of the Lodgepole were normal throughout the formation with the exception of a pair of brief spikes of gas. The ﬁrst spike came in near measured depth 10,900 feet reaching over 1,800 total units and raised the background gas value by 500 total units. The second noted increase in LP gas was recorded just past measured depth 11,100 feet </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation Shirley Moen 44-34-3H is a horizontal well intended to ﬁirther develop production of the Bakken formation in the Amegard ﬁeld of the Williston Basin. Drilled to a horizontal position within the Bakken, the wellbore was turned approximately 40° to an azimuth of 0°/360° north and tracked zone for over ten thousand feet. The Shirley Moen 4434-3H is located 5 miles southwest of Amegard, North Dakota in the SE SE Section 34 T150N RIOOW. The well was spud on January, 15‘, 2015 and drilled to 2,310 feet true vertical depth. 9 5/8 inch surface casing was set at 2,301 feet, cemented, and rig relocated over to the second of the two wells being drilled, <br/>The second of this pair of wells is the Lois Moen 44-34HU which spud on January 2"“, 2015 and is situated 45 feet directly west of the Shirley Moen 44—34-3H. Batch drilling the wells was made possible a hydraulically self-propelled, walking drill rig Pioneer 77. Once established in the middle member of the Bakken, both laterals were designed to proceeded north, parallel to one another. The close proximity of the two laterals in both time and distance along with three other horizontal wells previously drilled on this location, provided valuable information aiding the Geosteering of each subsequent lateral. </p>

    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">On site geological services began at 11:15 am CT on January 12”‘, 2015 from the measured depth of 9,300 feet, low within the Charles formation. Ten foot, thirty foot, ﬁﬁy foot lagged samples were caught by geologist/mud loggers, and roughnecks. A single set of cleaned and dried samples were preserved for archive at The North Dakota Geological Survey's Wilson M. Laird Core and Sample Library on the University of North Dakota campus in Grand Forks. The bottom hole coordinates of the Shirley Moen 44-34-3H are 244’ FNL 1,310’ FEL Section 27 T150N R100W, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. <br/>Aﬁer drilling surface hole with salt water brine, the vertical wellbore, and curve were drilled with petroleum based invert mud. An eight and three quarter inch wellbore was drilled to the end of the wells curve. Then an intermediate 7 inch casing was set and cemented at 11,460 feet measured depth. The lateral leg was drilled with a six inch bit using saltwater based drilling ﬂuid to a total depth of 20,812 measured feet. On site Geologic Consulting and Total Gas Detection monitoring equipment were provided by Neset Consulting Services, Tioga, North Dakota. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The original well plan had called for a landing target of 11,132 feet true vertical depth. Applying formation depths seen while drilling the Lois Moen 44-34HU days earlier, the landing target was lowered to 11,140 feet true vertical depth as soon as logging began. This depth was intended to place the wellbore 18 vertical feet into the middle Bakken member. If achieved, the wellbore would be at the bottom of an eventual 8 foot target window yet to be calculated for the lateral leg of the well. </p>

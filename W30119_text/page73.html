    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The drilling assembly exited casing high within the target window as slide drilling to achieve the planned 40° right turn to 0°/360° north began. While turning, the wellbore was lowered into zone where it maintained a position within lower half of the target for over 800 measured feet. Still slide drilling for directional turn the assembly continued dropping in zone with inclinations lower than that of the estimated target. Around 13,000 feet measured depth, gamma data alerted to a target change. A new estimated angle of 900° was applied to the window, resulting in a three foot shift up of the target at the time. Drill cuttings sampled through this initial interval were typical and reinforced the target model. Clean dolomite, generally tan to light brown to translucent brown was the dominate lithology returning while high within zone. Cuttings recovered while low in zone were noted to have increasing amounts of clastic sediment within the dolomite. Gas values over this span averaged 650 total units with occasional spikes as high as 1,400 units Petroleum shows on washed samples and ﬂuorescent streams seen when cut with solvent were consistently fast and present on most samples. <br/>With the wellbore low to the target, the directional turn was completed near measured depth 13,000 feet and allowed for an increased rate of penetration. On January 17‘“, 2015 a failure of the MWD tools resulted in a trip to surface for a new assembly at 7:45 am from measured depth 13,518 feet. Lateral drilling resumed later the same day at 6:55 pm. Multiple target changes were now projecting an estimated 90. 15° with the wellbore still low and out of the target zone. Effort to push the assembly up and into the window were met with success by measured depth 14,500 feet when the wellbore crossed up and into the eight foot target window. <br/>The wellbore’s inclination was taken up over 91° to achieve a position within the projected target. Once there, gamma data revealed a different target position and a down dip angle of 898°. The vertical change of the target was less than 3 feet and the assembly’s high inclination was arrested as it reached the top line of the target. The wellbore would be centered within zone before measured depth 16,000 feet. This interval of the lateral produced a pass through the target zone from low to high and the same lithology was reﬂected in the sampled cuttings. Tan dolomite at the top with stronger shows of petroleum and sandy to silty dolomite at the bottom of the target and slightly weaker signs of it. </p>

    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">With the assembly now centered in the target, a mud motor failure occurred at measured depth 15,937 feet and was followed by a trip to the surface on January 18‘“, 2015 at 1:20 pm CT. Drilling resumed the following morning at 3:00 am CT. For the next 2,500 measured feet, drilling rates reached their highest levels of the entire well while keeping the wellbore within the eight foot target window. Gamma data was monitored closely and used to calculate only minor adjustments to the target. <br/>Sampled cuttings began to degrade in quality and decline in recoverably amounts. When available and cleanable, samples of tan dolomite were identiﬁed originating from the same vertical depths that the latest target model suggested. A ﬁve hundred foot stretch of this interval was spent on the bottom line of zone. Inclusions of detrital sediment within the dolomite were only minor and less pronounced than generally expected. Petroleum shows were still respectable while gas increased to an average background of 810 total units by measured depth 19,000 feet. </p>

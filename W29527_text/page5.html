    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">RIH with 9â€”5/8" 36.0# /J55 / LTC surface casing to 2,193' (A . 1 <br/>Attempt to gain circulation prior to cement job on H6 and communication was discovered between the H6 and H7 that had been drilled and cemented 27 hrs prior. The communication was coming up the 9 5/8" annulus on the H7 although there were no apparent issues with the H7 cement job with full returns throughout, the plug was bumped and floats held. After discussing this with the Noble 2 crew it was noted that 6 joints from set depth, displacement returns were lost on the H6 and the DSV was not notified. Decision made to POOH 9 5/8" casing on the H6 to the depth where displacement returns were lost (2193') to attempt to regain circulation. Pulled a total of 10 joints of casing attempting to gain circulation on the H6. Noted continued communication between the H6 and the 9 5/ " annulus on the H7. Decision was made to install dry cap with needle valve/gauge on the H7 dry cap and continue to RIH with casing on the H6. RlH with casing on the H6 with full displacement returns noting pressure fluctuations on the H7 dry Cap of a maximum of 50 psi. Casing was landed on the H6. Shoe: 2,362', Float Collar: 2,284'. Circulation was established with no issues on the H6. <br/>Circulate and condition wellbore prior to cementing at 328 gpm / 250 psi with good returns. PJSM with Halliburton, Noble Rig crew, Fluid Pro, and Hess DSV. Break off circulating swedge and install cement head with top and bottom non rotating plugs, R/U high pressure lines. <br/>Pressure Test Lines to 3500 psi <br/>Pump 20 bbls Flush @ 5 bpm. <br/>Pumping 261 bbls (495 sks) Lead Cement [60% excess] mixed @ 11.5 ppg Varicem 2.97 yield @ 5 bpm. + 90# of Tuf fiber <br/>Pump 59 bbls (165 sks) tail cement [20% excess] mixed @ 13.0 ppg Varicem 2.01 yield @ 5 bpm. Displace cement with 177 bbls fresh water @ 5 bpm. <br/>Slow rate to 2 bpm at 20 out and 1 bpm at 5 out. <br/>Bump plug with 500 psi over FCP of 270 psi. <br/>Pressure held @ 730 psi. Check floats- Received 0.5 bbl back at bleed off after holding pressure <br/>Good returns throughout cement job. <br/>Calculated cement to surface: 108 bbls <br/>Actual cement to surface = 90 bbls. <br/>Cement in place at 14:32 hrs. <br/>Rig down Halliburton high pressure lines and cement head. <br/>While circulating the H6 prior to the cement job, the needle valve on the H7 dry cap was closed and the gauge was removed in order to check for a vacuum. Once the needle valve was opened a vacuum on the H7 9 5/8 annulus was noted. Replaced gauge on needle valve. Once cementing began on the H6, pressure of 250 psi was noted on the gauge of the H7 dry cap and this pressure remained constant throughout the H6 cementjob. The H6 cement job was pumped as planned with full returns throughout and 90 bbls of cement to surface. Pressure of 250 psi remained on the H7 dry cap after the H6 cement plug was bumped. After bleeding back 0.5 bbl on the H6 cement job after holding pressure on the cement plug the pressure on the H7 dry cap remained at 250 psi. Decision made to leave dry cap with needle valve/gauge on the H7. </p>

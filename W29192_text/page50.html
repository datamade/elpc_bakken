The initial phase is a vertical and curve, landing 15.54 feet within the Middle Bakken Member of the Bakken Formation. The Rennerfeldt 7-30H spudded on October 7, 2014 and reached a total depth of 21,522’ MD on December 13th, 2014. The Bottom Hole Location is 236.68' FSL & 640.23' FEL Section 31 T155N R98W, Williams County, North Dakota. </p>

Thirty foot lagged samples were collected during the straight hole and curve while one hundred foot lagged samples were caught during the lateral. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at <br/>the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, ND. Vertical 9,400’ — 11,404 ’ 1WD <br/>Logging services began at 9,400 feet in the Charles formation on November 15“‘, 2014 at 3:27 PM CST. Drill rates averaged 1.63 minutes per foot throughout the vertical section, with the gas averaging 112 units, with the highest peaks coming from the just above the Upper Bakken Shale at 3,387 units. <br/>Base of the Last Salt 9,512’ MD 9,511 ’ T VD -7,203 ’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Charles Salt was encountered at 9,511’ TVD and 7,203’ SS, 16’ high to prognosis but 5’ lower than the adjacent Rennerfeldt 8—30H1 well. The Base of the Last Salt was picked by the last sample with salt present, an ROP change, and gamma data. Drill rates in the Base of the Last Charles Salt averaged 0.58 minutes per foot with gas up to 66 units. Typical samples were medium to dark gray brown Limestone, micrite and wackestone, argillaceous, moderately to well indurated, poor intergranular porosity with interbedded Anhydrite that was cream, soﬁ to pasty, and comprising a maximum concentration of 30% in collected samples. Cuts and ﬂuorescence ‘shows were sporadic and questionable due to the oil-based mud, with the exception of bright white mineral ﬂuorescence displayed by any present Anhydrite. <br/>Mission Canyon 9, 721 ’ MD 9, 720’ T VD -7,412’ SS <br/>The top of the Mission Canyon was picked at 9,720’ TVD, which was 16’ high to prognosis but 1’ lower than the adjacent Rennerfeldt 8-3 0H1 well. The pick was based off of the gamma marker and sample change, along with drill breaks in ROP and differential pressure. Drill rates in the Mission Canyon averaged 0.67 minutes per foot with gas up to 91 units. Typical samples were medium to dark gray brown, tan gray, and cream gray Limestone, micrite to wackestone, argillaceous, banded, moderately </p>

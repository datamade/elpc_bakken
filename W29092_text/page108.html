P Vance 154-97—14-9-21-15H <br/>The above cement volumes are approximate and were calculated under the assumption that a gauge hole will be achieved with a 10% excess factor. Actual cement volumes may vary due to variations in the actual hole gauge and will be determined by running a caliper log on the drilled hole. <br/>All waiting on cement (WOC) times will be adequate to achieve a minimum of 500 psi compressive strength at the casing shoe prior to drilling out. <br/>5. MUD PROGRAM - <br/>     <br/>Fluid Loss <br/>70/30 OWR 15cc’s <br/>1 True Vertical Depth. 2 Measured Depth. <br/>       <br/>       <br/>Sufﬁcient mud material(s) to maintain mud properties, control lost circulation and contain a blowout will be available at the well site during drilling operations. <br/>6. EVALUATION PROGRAM <br/>Logs : The logging program will be run by Schlumberger and will consist of their Platform Express plus BHC Sonic from 11893' to 2425'. The Gamma Ray and resistivity log will be pulled back to surface. <br/>  <br/>DST’s : DST’s will be run as warranted by logs and/or shows - none are scheduled at this time. <br/>Cores : None anticipated at this time. <br/>  <br/>The evaluation program may change at the discretion of the well site geologist, with prior <br/>approval from the Authorized Ofﬁcer, North Dakota Field Ofﬁce, Bureau of Land Management. <br/>Stimulation : No stimulation or frac treatment has been formulated for this test at this time. The drill site, as approved, will be of sufﬁcient size to accommodate all completion activities. <br/>COMPLETION <br/>The planned top of the 4.5” 1 1.6” production liner will be 50-100 ft above the kick off point. This liner will be cemented throughout the lateral and a wet shoe sub will be set at the toe of the liner. The frac string will be 12.75# P-110 with TSHP threads and stung into a PBR run </p>

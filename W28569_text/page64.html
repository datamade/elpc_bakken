    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Gadeco, LLC Alexander 26-35 STF H well, was drilled as a single lateral horizontal well, targeting the Three Forks. Surface location of the Alexander 26-35 5TFH is 262’ FNL and 2,282’ FEL Section 26 T155N R99W, William County, North Dakota. Bottom hole location of Alexander 26-35 STFH is 21 1.90’ FSL and 1,522.58’ FEL, Section 35 T155N R99W, Williams County, North Dakota. <br/>The Alexander 26-35 STFH spudded on June, 25 2014 and reached a total depth of 21,017’ on August 28, 2014 72 days from spud. The well was drilled vertically from surface to a MD of 10,543’ at kick off point (KOP). Drilling continued to intermediate casing point and seven inch intermediate casing was set at MD 1 1,506’. Ultimately TD was reached on August 28, 2014. Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided mud logging services from a measured depth of 7,800' on June 25, 2014 at 8:42 AM CDT. Heidi Smith was the main wellsite geologist for the entire well, while Dennis Beehler took temporary duties from August 8, 2014 to August 14, 2014. Pati Clausen was the regular mudlogger. Samples from a measured depth of 7,800” were caught, described and logged by Neset Consulting personnel. Neset Consulting Services included, sample logging, gamma monitoring and gas monitoring. Neset Consulting Gas provided Total Gas detection equipment. Thirty-foot samples were caught through the vertical and curve while 50 foot samples were captured in the lateral. There was one side-track on this well in the vertical, it occurred at a MD of 14,630’ due to a Lower Bakken shale strike. The original well bore was cemented back to MD 1 1,800’ where time-drilling began the side track. <br/>Logging began in the Amsden Memeber at 7,800’ on June 25, 2014 at 8:24 AM CDT. Drilling continued to intermediate casing point (MD 11,521) in the Three Forks, approximately 16’ beneath the Lower Bakken Shale. The curve was landed at 88 degrees and TVD 11,143’. <br/>VERTICAL MD 7,800’—MD 10,543’ CURVE MD 10,543’—MD 11,521’ <br/>While logging the upper hole no signiﬁcant geological features were logged. Drilling went as expected ranging mostly between 40 ft/hr to 75 ft/hr. Samples were consistent with known lithology. Gas values logged ranged from 35 units to around 250 units, most of the higher gas values were logged in the Mission Canyon Formation. Some sliding was utilized to correct deviation from the veltical. Gamma data was not gathered until MD 10,160’ in the lower Mission Canyon, therefore the formation tops above this depth were chosen on based on sample and ROP changes. </p>

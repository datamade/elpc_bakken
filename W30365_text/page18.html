Additional capacity plans include the Big Gulch compressor station which is scheduled to come online mid2016 and will add 35 MMCFD of capacity to this area.

Purchaser capacity is not expected to be sufficient for the volumes produced from these wells. In the event that electric power is required on-site, a natural gas powered generator will be evaluated. Installation of a liquid stripping plant to be utilized in the event of upset conditions would not be economic. Such an installation will be re-evaluated as additional wells are completed and if conditions change. <br/>6b. A natural gas powered generator could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 30-40 MCFD. A liquid stripping plant could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 40%. On lease gas use by Heater/Treaters will consume approximately 15 MCFD </p>

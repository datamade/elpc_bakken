Additional TF wells were added to the Development Plan based on sucoessful TF drilling and completions in and around CCU and promising initial results from Burlington’s pilot wells. Burlington plans to continue evaluating the TF formation in 2013 which may result in additional TF well locations being added to the DeveIOpment Plan. The CCU drilling schedule is affected by facility constraints, minimizing rig moves, and seasonal operations in the Little Missouri State Park. Additionally, the pad and facility sites in the Development Plan were initial projections subject to change. Burlington has made every effort to accommodate landowner concerns, minimize surface disturbance, and consolidate pads where terrain and economics allow. <br/>These quarterly updates are intended to provide the NDIC with advanced notice of permit applications and modiﬁcations to the Development Plan for CCU and will not be ﬁnalized until permits are approved and well pads are built. <br/>Exhibit “A” contains a listing of wells drilled in 2012 and Wells planned for 2013-2014. Wells are grouped by well pad and include the target formation and current status of each well. <br/>Exhibit “B” illustrates the wells drilled with green lines, wells permitted and approved for 2013 with blue lines, wells permitted and still being processed with yellow lines, wells planned but not permitted for 2013-2014 with red lines. and existing wells drilled prior to unitization with grey lines. <br/>  </p>

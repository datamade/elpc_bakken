Drilling times in the Lodgepole below KOP were between 3 5-105 minutes sliding. Gas varied between 22— 331 units. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the Lodgepole to correlate to the <br/>Peterson 11-34H. Target was changed from 10,3 79’ to 10,3 74’ based on Lodgepole correlations. </p>

Background gas was from 157 to 561 units in the shale. A typical sample was Shale: Black, dark grey, platy to blocky, trace cream to grey limestone, very carbonaceous, dull yellow pinpoint to no ﬂuorescence, instant bright yellow milky cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,461 ’ MD 10,340’ TVD -8,154’ SS <br/>At 10,340’ TVD the Middle Bakken was encountered. This top was picked ﬁom both lithology and gamma changes. The upper portion of the Middle Bakken exhibited limestone that was light gray, gray tan, tan, slightly argillaceous, dolomitic in part, microcrystalline, poor intergranular porosity, with pale yellow ﬂuorescence, slow weak yellow-green milky cut. After the upper portion of limestone, sample lithology changed to sandstone A typical sample exhibited white to cream sandstone, with dark grey inclusions, dark grey in part, very ﬁne to ﬁne grain, calcareous grains, dolomitic in part, friable, poor calcareous cement, sub round to sub angular, fair to poor sorting, poor to fair visible porosity, pail yellow ﬂuorescence, fast milky yellow green cut, slow yellow streaming cut. This middle sandstone Facies D member was the target zone. <br/>The curve was landed at 10,622’ MD. Casing point was reached at 10,375.28’ TVD on august 12, 2014. . <br/>Lateral 10,622’ - 20,366 ’ MD <br/>The Peterson 41-33XH Middle Bakken Lateral was begun at 10:00 pm CDT August 13, 2014. A lateral turn was started immediately after coming out of the Casing shoe. 30 foot surveys would be used per state requirement until the completion of the lateral turn. The lateral turn would be completed at 11,000 MD, where the directional team would resume shooting 90 foot surveys. The initial dip rate of the lateral would be at 89.45 degrees. The wellbore would be drilled along this dip rate for the ﬁrst day of the lateral. </p>

OXY intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drillin rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the Nch per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43.02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previoust outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43.02-03-55 of the NDAC, Is being requested to take advantage of the cost and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. OXY understand NDAC 43.02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced Immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43.02-03-19 at 19.1). OXY will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the well Is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after pudding the well with the smaller drilling rig. <br/>OXY USAINC. 713 350-4921 PO BOX 27757 Z” °°"° HOUSTON TX 77277-7757 <br/>I Ludwin Franco DRILLING ENGINEER Jul 1, 2014 Ludwin - __Franco@ox .com <br/>    <br/>                                                                            <br/>     <br/>   <br/>   <br/>      <br/>  <br/>g <br/>Ti""ENGINEERING TECHNICIAN </p>

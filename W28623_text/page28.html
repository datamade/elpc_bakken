The Bakken Shale marker was chosen based on an abrupt jump in gamma and a drastic change in samples makeup. The Bakken Shale gamma reached levels over 400+ API with background gases increasing from 10 units to over 165+ units. Samples changed from limestone over to dark black, dark brown shale with ﬁrm to hard, brittle texture, and a rough, waxy, platy, jagged, blocky, heavily carbonaceous structure. The shale carried spotty greenish white ﬂuorescence, pale yellow thick cloudy/fast milky cut. </p>

Testing the sample with hydrochloric acid, it was clear that the sample was made up mostly of siltstone. The mixture of sandstone and dolomite had poor to moderate induration, with poor to fair intergranular porosity. In whole, the dolomitic and siltstone samples in the Middle Bakken can be characterized as very fme grained, soft to ﬁrm, silty, subrounded to rounded, somewhat subangular, with even light yellow ﬂuorescence, and a good streaming cut. Background gas while drilling through the Middle Bakken averaged 150 - 155 units of total gas. The Middle Bakken siltstone/dolomite was encountered three feet higher than expected, according to the adjusted prognosis. Samples consisted siltstone: Cream tan brown, light brown tan, light gray, cream tan, tan beige, colorless, off white, white, very ﬁne to ﬁne grained, soﬁ to ﬁrm, dolomitic cement, argillaceous, pasty, mottled, fair induration, rounded to subangular, poor intergranular porosity, scattered spotty thin brown oil staining, even pale yellowish ﬂuorescence, instant cloudy broad streaming to milky cut with olive/ green halo. <br/>Three Forks 10,800 ’ MD 10,663 ’ TVD -8,5 71 ’ SS <br/>The Three Forks samples were composed of very ﬁnely grained sandstone to siltstone. The sandstone had poor to moderate induration, with poor to fair intergranular porosity. In whole, the samples in the Three Forks can be characterized as very ﬁnely grained, soft to ﬁrm, silty, subrounded to rounded, somewhat subangular, with an even light yellow ﬂuorescence, and a slow pinpoint streaming cloudy yellow cut. Background gas while drilling through the Three Forks averaged 50 - 55 units of total gas with a maximum background gas of 958 units. A typical sample presented as SANDSTONE: Cream tan-gray, light to medium cream tan, medium cream brown, light to medium gray, light cream gray, very ﬁne grained, silty in part, moderate to poor induration, slightly argillaceous, moderate to well sorted, moderate porosity, interbedded light gray green shale, rounded to sub round, slightly calcareous, gritty to smooth, blocky, argillaceous, even light yellow ﬂuorescence, quick cloudy slow streaming cut. </p>

ROP in the lateral averaged 0 6 min/ft. with background gas averaging 54 units with a max of 148 units. <br/>At a MD of 14,174’ and a TVD of 10,671 ’ we encountered the McKenzie shale. Once the <br/>shale strike was conﬁrmed by the bottoms up sample it was decided to side track. The rig tripped </p>

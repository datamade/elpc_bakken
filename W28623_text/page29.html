    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">back to 13,600’ MD and began to time drill. Once timed drilling was completed the directional team attempted to drill ahead by sliding. It was conﬁrmed quickly that separation was not achieved, and the rig tripped out of the hole for a new BHA. Once the new BHA was picked up, the rig tripped back in to the wellbore to 13,550’ MD and began to time drill once again. Separation was achieved and we began to drill ahead. While drilling ahead in the sidetka we started experiencing some issues with our MWD tool ﬂat-lining and the readings from the tool were not accurate. After drilling to a survey point at 14,336’ MD the rig tripped out of the hole once again to replace a faulty MWD tool. At this time it was also decided that when we picked up the new tools we would re-log the gamma for the sidetka starting at a MD of 13,550’. <br/>Once the faulty BHA was replaced and the rig tripped back in the hole we began relogging the gamma through the sidetrack. Once we reached bottom drilling was resumed and continued with the sidetrack wellbore. While drilling to the measured depth of 16,653’ MD / 10680.62 TVD we encountered the lower three forks shale because the target was set to low in section of the zone. This lower shale strike exposed twenty-eight feet of shale. <br/>Due to targets being set of the lower side of the zone using a down dip for inclination the drilling assembly encountered the shale at these three other areas 17,906’ MD / 10682.93 TVD / 7263.60 VS , —18,932’ MD/ 10683.23 /8284.90’ VS, - 19753’ MD/ 10679.87’ TVD/ 9063.96’ VS. While drilling the Field Trust 7-6 #8TFH we conducted three trips during the lateral section of the wellbore. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The Statoil Oil & Gas, LP, Field Trust 7-6 8TFH well was drilled to a total depth of 20,580 feet measured depth on October 03, 2014 at 10:30 AM CDT in the Three Forks formation. The Statoil Oil & Gas, LP, Field Trust 7-6 8TFH was completed in Section 6 T154N R101W of the Todd ﬁeld with bottom hole coordinates of SW, SE, Section 6 T154N R101W 269.46’ FSL & 2,411.75' FWL. The overall porosity, ﬂuorescence, and cuts ranged from none to fair, with a majority of the lateral showing poor to fair results. The Statoil Oil & Gas, LP, Field Trust 7-6 8TFH is currently awaiting completion. </p>

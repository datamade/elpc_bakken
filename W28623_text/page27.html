The well is located in the Todd ﬁeld with surface hole coordinates of 400‘ FSL & 2,006' FEL in Williams County, North Dakota. The Statoil Oil & Gas, LP, Field Trust 7-6 8TFH was spud on June 21, 2014. A total measured depth of 20,580 feet was reached on October 3, 2014 at 10:30 AM CDT in the Three Forks formation. A 9 5/8” surface casing was set at 2,237 feet MD and 7” intermediate casing to 10,906 feet measure depth in the Three Forks formation. <br/>Nathan Schrum and Buckley Thoreson of Neset Consulting Service provided mudlogging and geological services. Well site geological services began on July 16, 2014 at 7:30 am Central Stande Time at 9,000 feet measured depth and continued through to total depth was reached. Pason EDR logging system service was utilized throughout the entire well for monitoring the gas and providing drilling parameters. The Kelly Bushing for the Statoil Oil & Gas, LP, Field Trust 7-6 8TF H, well was 2,092 feet & the ground elevation was 2,066 feet. Thirty and ﬁﬁy foot sample intervals were collected, cleaned, and cataloged to be archived at Statoil Oil & Gas, LP. in Austin, Texas and at the North Dakota Geological Survey core library. <br/>Vertical 8,600’ — 10,906’ MD <br/>Mud-logging began in the Charles Salt formation at a depth of 9,000 feet. Neset Gas Detection was utilized for monitoring gas. Logging services began on July 16, 2014 at 7:30 AM CDT. The Mission Canyon and Lodgepole read very low, averaging between 10 — 25 units. Throughout the Mission Canyon and Lodgepole, the rate of penetration averaged somewhat better, at 40 — 60 FT/HR. <br/>Lodgepole 9,891 ’ MD 9,896’ T VD -7,804’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,891’ feet, 9,896’ true vertical depth, and a sub-sea of -7,804’ The Lodgepole formation was picked based on a slight change in sample coloration and penetration rates. The color of the limestone transitioned from a dark gray, gray brown color over to a medium to light gray tan, light gray, cream gray coloration. The limestone was of a microcrystalline structure, ﬁrm to hard, blocky, fragmented, jagged structure. The limestone of the Lodgepole was also varied from slightly to very argillaceous, less carbonaceous at the beginning and then becoming very carbonaceous; chalky porosity with dull to even green/white, green/yellow ﬂuorescence and oil cuts ranging from none to a cloudy cut with thin streaming towards the lower portion of the zone. <br/>Gas levels ranged from 10 — 20 units, with the average gas staying around 15 units. Drill rates were consistent for the ﬁrst part of the zone, averaging 1.0 to 1.5 min per foot and then becoming erratic while sliding ranging from .5 to 4.0. The vertical portion of the wellbore was drilled successfully to our KOP of 9,900’ foot measured depth. We reached KOP at 10,190' MD on July 17, 2014 at 11:30 am central standard time in the Lodgepole formation. <br/>Curve Section 10,190’ - 10,906’ MD </p>

The curve began in the Lodgepole formation heading towards the target Middle Bakken formation. Upon entering the Upper Bakken shale, penetration rates increased from 2.5 min/ﬂ to 1.0 to 1.5 min/ﬂ averaging roughly 1.2 min/ﬂ and background gases rose from around 90 units to over 200+ units and then increasing to an average of 25 units. The samples in the False Bakken & Kinderhook Lime exhibited a cream gray tan/light gray tan, light gray/ gray, light gray brown/brown, light brown/tan, ﬁrm/hard, microcrystalline/crystalline, <br/>3 </p>

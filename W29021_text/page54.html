    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">blocky, carbonaceous shale, with trace amounts of dolomite and limestone, with a scattered yellow green ﬂuorescence, and instant cloudy, slow streaming yellow green cut, <br/>with cut drying to a good yellow gold ﬂuorescence halo, and under white light, gradually turning strong amber. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,385 ’ MD 10,225 ’ TVD -8,260’ SS <br/>Middle Bakken was picked at 10,385 feet measured depth; 10,225 feet true vertical depth marked by a sharp drop in gamma, and transition from shale to dolomitic, silty limestone noted in samples. Samples consisted of light to medium cream, cream gray, tan, moderately pyritic, slightly banded and platy in part siltstone, with light to medium gray, cream gray, gray brown, gray tan, ﬁrm to soft, hard in part, tight, dense, microcrystalline, argillaceous, fragmental limestone, and cream gray, cream tan, tan, ﬁnely grained to silty, sub to well rounded, sub angular in part, fairly sorted, slightly pyritic sandstone with tight calcareous cementation and fair to good intergranular <br/>porosity. <br/>The curve was landed at 10,529 feet driller’s measured depth, and a projected 10,248.40 feet true vertical depth, approximately 23 feet within the Middle Bakken shortly before 9:30 PM CDT on October 12”, 2014, 11 days from spud. <br/>Lateral 10,529 ’ —— 1 7,360’ MB <br/>Seven inch casing was run and set at 10,514 feet measured depth and cemented into place. Bit number six, a Hughes 4062, directional BHA, and four inch drill pipe were picked up. On the morning of the 15TH of October, 2014, the ﬂoat and cement were drilled, and a casing pressure test was successﬁrlly completed. The shoe and ten feet of open formation were drilled, and a formational integrity test was successﬁilly performed. The lateral section of the wellbore began drilling ahead at 9:00 AM CDT. <br/>The Sanish ﬁeld targeting methodology was used for the duration of the lateral wellbore. A nine foot targeting window was used, with the top of the window initially set at 10,243 feet true vertical depth at 10,385 feet measured depth, and projected at an anticipated dip rate of 90.45 degrees. The target line was set six feet below the top, with the base of the window an additional three feet below the target. The observed dip rate of the lateral rolled, averaging between 90.4 and 90.7 degrees between multiple B to C facies gamma contacts. <br/>The ﬁrst day of lateral drilling, the 15TH of October, 2014, began at 9:00 AM CDT, with drill rates while rotating averaging between 100 and 130 feet per hour, and 50 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 440 units. The ﬁrst surveys out of intermediate casing saw inclinations of 87.82, well below the EOC projection of 9023 degrees. The wellbore dropped into the C facies following 10,510 feet measured depth, and out the bottom of the target window following 10,550 feet measured depth. Multiple upward slides, as well as slides to ﬁnish the planned turn were implemented over the ﬁrst day of drilling. Samples consisted primarily of light to dark gray, gray brown, cream gray, siltstone, which was pyritic, argillaceous, moderately to heavily dolomitic, and moderate dark gray striations, with fair induration.

The well is located in the NW ‘A, SW ‘/4, Section 4, Township 153N, Range 92W of Mountrail County, northwest of New Town, North Dakota. <br/>This well was spud in on October I“, 2014 at 1:30 AM CDT. Well site geological services began at 8,300 feet measured depth on October 8TH, 2014 shortly before 3:00 AM CDT. Ten, thirty, and ﬁﬁy—foot lagged samples were caught by mud loggers and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>A thirteen and one half inch wellbore was drilled to 2,126 feet measured depth, and nine and ﬁve eighths inch casing was run and set. The remaining vertical wellbore and curve was drilled, and seven inch intermediate casing was ran and set at 10,514 feet measured depth. One six inch bit was used while drilling lateral number one. Total gas hotwire monitoring system was used for the duration of logging services. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Dishman #13—19—2H vertical wellbore, with original curve, reached a total depth of 10,529 feet measured depth shortly before 9:30 PM CDT on October 12”, 2014, approximately 23 feet into the Middle Bakken, 11 days from spud. Horizontal leg began at 9:00 AM CDT on October 15”, 2014, reaching a total measured depth of 17,360 feet on October 20”, 2014 shortly aﬁer 1:30 PM CDT, 19 days from spud, <br/>Began logging in the Charles Formation <br/>Logging services began at 8,300 feet measured depth in the Charles formation at 3:00 AM CDT on October 8”, 2014. Charles consisted primarily of anhydrite, limestone, and interlaminated dolomite. Drill rates ranged from 05-15 minutes per foot. Background gas averaged 30 units. A trip was performed within the Charles at 8,462 feet measured depth at 1:00 PM CDT on October 8”, 2014 due to slow drill rates. Bit number three, a Smith MDSi616 was picked up and tripped in, drilling resumed shortly after 10:00 PM CDT. Base of the last salt was picked at 8,578 feet measured depth, 8,577 feet true vertical depth, with a drill break of .5 to 1 minute per foot. Samples following consisted primarily of beds of anhydrite, limestone, and minor dolomite, with interbedded shale through the Mission Canyon. <br/>Mission Canyon 8, 757’ MD 8, 756’ T VD -6, 791 ’ SS <br/>Mission Canyon was picked at 8,757 feet measured depth using MWD gamma data. The Mission Canyon consisted of predominantly light to medium cream gray, microcrystalline, fairly argillaceous limestone, off white to cream white anhydrite and light tan brown, tan, rnicrocrystalline dolomite.

Background gas averaged 40 to 70 units through the Mission Canyon. <br/>Lodgepole 9,404 ’ MD 9,403 ’ TVD - 7, 738’ SS <br/>Lodgepole was picked at 9,404 feet measured depth using MWD gamma data. A minor change in sample coloring, from medium to dark brown, to light to medium gray, as well as a slight increase in porosity noted across the Lodgepole top. Drill rates <br/>averaged .5 minutes per foot in the initial portion of the Lodgepole. Background gas averaged 80 to 110 units through the Lodgepole. </p>

    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Curve 9, 703 ’ — 10,529 ’ MD <br/>Kick off point was selected within the Lodgepole at 9,703 feet measured depth, and was reached shortly after 8:00 PM CDT on October 9”, 2014. A trip out of the hole was performed, and the curve assembly, including a Hughes IDSI616 bit was picked up and tripped in the hole. Drilling of the curve began at 9:00 AM CDT on October 10“, 2014. Drill rates averaged one to two minutes per foot through the curve. <br/>Correlations were made with the Dishman #13—19H as well as the Dishman 1319TFH MWD gamma logs using seven individual Lodgepole correlative markers and formation tops. The initial landing target based on the geological prognosis was set at 10,251 feet measured depth. Prior to beginning the curve, the target was moved up to 10,245 feet true vertical depth, and remained through the duration of the curve. The indicated landing target based on correlative Lodgepole gamma markers was slightly shallower at 10,238 feet true vertical depth, the landing of this curve was intentionally dropped from the normal 13 feet below the base of the Lower Bakken to be in line with the target window, based on the anticipated thickness of the B facies of the Middle Bakken. Typical samples in the lower Lodgepole consisted of light to medium gray, brown, gray tan, cream, cream gray, medium tan to tan, light brown, very ﬁne to microcrystalline, slightly argillaceous limestone, with trace anhydrite, and scattered light brown oil staining. <br/>False Bakken 10,313’ MD 10,192’ TVD -8,227’ SS <br/>False Bakken was picked at a measured depth of 10,313 feet, 10,192 feet true vertical depth. The Scallion was logged at 10,318 feet measured depth, 10,195 feet true vertical depth. Background gas increased to a peak of 4,467 units following the Scallion. A trip was performed following the Scallion at 10,339 feet measured depth shortly before 8:00 PM CDT on October 11”, 2014, to pick up a tri—cone bit due to turn rates needed. A Smith F30T was picked up and tripped in the hole, drilling of the curve resumed at 11:00 AM CDT on October 12TH, 2014. A trip gas of 5,842 units was circulated with bottoms <br/>up. </p>

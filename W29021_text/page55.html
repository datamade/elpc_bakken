    <p class="styleSans790.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>consisted of light to medium brown, off white in part, ﬁner to very ﬁnely grained, sub rounded to sub angular sandstone, with fair to poor intergranular porosity. <br/>Through the second day of lateral drilling, the 16TH of October, the wellbore was approaching the bottom of the target window, with slides increasing the inclination to above 92 degrees for the majority of the previous evening. The wellbore re—entered the base of the target window at 11,447 feet measured depth, with a calculated 90.44 degree dip rate between the previous contacts at 10,506 and 11,447 feet. Drill rates averaged between 120 and 140 feet per hour while rotating, and 30 to 40 feet per hour while sliding. Backgron gas averaged 110 units. Following a survey at 11,802 feet measured depth, the inclination of the wellbore dropped to near 885 degrees, and the wellbore exited the base of the B facies and into the C again at 12,108 feet measured depth, with a calculated 90.31 degree dip. <br/>On the morning of the 17TH of October, the wellbore re-entered the base of the B facies at 12,586 feet measured depth, with a calculated 90.88 degree dip rate between the contacts at 12,108 and 12,586 feet measured depth. Drill rates while rotating continued to average between 120 and 140 feet per hour, and from 30 to 40 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 110 units. Through the drilling day of the 17TH of October, the wellbore continued to ascend through structure, and exited the top of the target window at 13,530 feet measured depth, and into the A facies between 13,800 and 13,890 feet before being turned down. The wellbore had just re—entered the B facies as of morning report on the l8TH of October. <br/>During the fourth day of lateral drilling, the 18TH of October, drill rates averaged between 100 and 130 feet per hour while rotating, and 30 to 50 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas increased to an average of 180 units. The wellbore continued to descend, and dropped below the base of the B facies and into the C facies following 14,466 feet measured depth with a calculated 90.44 degree dip rate between the previous contacts at 12,586 and 14,466 feet measured depth. <br/>The wellbore remained within the C facies through 15,065 feet measured depth, re—entering the base of the B facies with a calculated dip rate of 90.77 degrees. The inclination of the wellbore rose to 94.97 degrees following a survey at 15,195 feet measured depth, leaving the top of the target window, and entering the A facies following 15,276 feet measured depth. Immediate corrective slides were implemented, and the wellbore returned to the target window and into the top of the B facies following 15,435 feet measured depth. <br/>Through the morning and aﬁernoon of the 19TH of October, drill rates while rotating averaged 100 to 130 feet per hour while rotating, and from 20 to 40 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 158 units. The wellbore continued to descend through the target window, and exited the base of the B facies and into the C following 16,010 feet measured depth, with a calculated 90.4 degree dip rate between the contacts at 15,065 and 16,010 feet measured depth, Corrective slides returned the wellbore to the base of the B facies, with a calculated dip rate of 90.7 degrees between contacts at 16,010 and 16,466 feet measured depth. Corrective slides were implemented again, and decreased the inclination of the wellbore from 9295 degrees to 8988 degrees on the survey at 16,748 feet measured depth, and the wellbore remained within the target window just above the target line going into the morning of the 20TH of October. <br/>6 </p>

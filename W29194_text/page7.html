Field gas is gathered and transported through the system to Hiland Partners’ Watford City Plant (Sec. 6-151N-102W) for processing. The system has interconnections to allow offloading excess gas volumes to Hess’ Tioga plant (Sec. 26-157N-95W) and to OneOK’s Stateline plant (Sec. 21—155N—103W). <br/>See attached plats. <br/>Gathering Segment Name: WC—Egging — Lakeside Gathering System <br/>3a. 3b. 3c. 3d.

Statewide percentage of gas flared: 11.31% (5/2014) 5b. Fieldwide percentage of gas ﬂared: Brooklyn, 2.4% (5/2014) <br/>Alternatives to Flaring <br/>6a. Purchaser capacity is expected to be sufficient for the volumes produced from these wells. In the event that electric power is required on-site, a natural gas powered generator will be evaluated. Installation of a liquid stripping plant to be utilized in the event of upset conditions would not be economic. Such an installation will be re-evaluated as additional wells are completed and if conditions change. <br/>6b. A natural gas powered generator could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 45-60 MCFD. A liquid stripping plant could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 40%. On lease gas use by Heater/Treaters will consume approximately 23 MCFD </p>

As the wellbore came down in inclination it left the clean gamma bench along the top of the target window and entered into a warmer gamma bench roughly 7 feet <br/>below the base of the LBS remnant. These gamma markers would be used to calculate formation dip throughout the rest of the well. </p>

As drilling continued the wellbore tracked along the bottom of the target window with the directional driller implementing slides to keep inclinations ﬁom becoming too extreme. <br/>Drilling continued along the base of the target window out to 13,600’ MD at which point the wellbore began to climb in inclination. At 14,300’ MD the clean gamma bench along the top of the target window was encountered and formation dip was <br/>calculated at 89.9 degrees. The directional driller put in a slide to steer the wellbore back down in inclination. <br/>From 15,400’ MD the wellbore was drilled in the bottom half of the target window out to 17,400’ MD at an averaged dip of 89.6 degrees. At 17,950’ MD the wellbore once again made contact with the clean gamma bench along the top of the target window. Drilling continued along top of the target window from this point out to 19,500’ MD at which point the BHA made contact with the LBS remnant. This was evident by a heat up in gamma up to 130 api. The directional team put in a series of slides to steer the wellbore away from the LBS remnant and back down into the target window. Once the warmer gamma bench inside the target window had been encountered formation dip was calculated at 89.1 degrees. The wellbore was allowed to drop to the bottom of the target window before the directional driller put in a series of slides to bring inclinations closer to dip. At this point the wellbore was rotated out to a TD of 21,080’ MD. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation Dolyniuk #34-23PH reached a total depth of 21,080’ MD at 4:30 AM MDT on August 4th, 2014. This well is currently awaiting completion. <br/>Braden Mickelsen Wellsite Geologist </p>

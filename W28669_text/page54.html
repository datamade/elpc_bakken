The lithology consisted of black, dark gray brown, ﬁrm to soﬁ, moderately compacted, carbonaceous, shale with trace gray tan limestone, showing patchy dull yellow ﬂuorescence, and instant cloudy yellow to fast fair streaming <br/>cuts. Drill rates, while sliding through the Upper Bakken Shale, averaged 100 ﬁ/hr.

The formation top was evaluated using samples, drill rates, and gamma. Samples in the Middle Bakken <br/>formation consisted of a light gray tan silty limestone.

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The top of the Pronghorn member of the Three Forks formation came in at 10,614’ TVD. The top of the formation was called where the gamma cooled down to 80 api. Remnants of the Lower Bakken Shale were exhibited through a warmer gamma marker at the base of the Middle Bakken/top of the Pronghorn formation. The Pronghorn member is in the upper portion of the Three Forks formation and was the primary interest of this well. Initially the formation consisted of light to medium brown, gray brown, medium tan, gray tan, argillaceous, micro to very ﬁnely crystalline dolomite. <br/>The curve was landed at 11,015’ MD/10,622’ TVD at 90.74 degrees at 6: 15 AM MDT on July 30‘“, 2014. At this time a trip to surface was made to run and cement intermediate casing. <br/>Lateral 11,015’-—21,080’ MD <br/>Intermediate casing was set at a measured depth of 11,005 feet. They began drilling the lateral at 6:30 PM MDT on July 313‘, 2014. The lateral wellbore was drilled with a Security MM64D, six inch drill bit. The target window, for drilling, was placed 5 feet below the base of the LBS remnant and extended 10 feet down into the pronghom formation. Formation dip was initially proposed at 89.6 degrees. In the ﬁrst portion of the lateral, the directional team had to make a turn as per the well plan. </p>

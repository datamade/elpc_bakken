Burlington Resources respectfully request a waiver from the tbglpkr requirement included in NDAC43-02-03-021: Casing, Tubing, and Cementing requirements during the completion period immediately following the upcoming fracture stimulation. The following assurances apply: <br/>. The well is equipped with new 32# 7" casing from surface to 11579.6 MD with an API burst rating of 11640 psi <br/>. The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.80* API burst rating to determine the max pressure <br/>. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment <br/>. The casing is exposed to signiﬁcantly lower rates and pressures during the flow back than during the frac <br/>. The frac ﬂuid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates 6. Productin equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing 7. A 300# gauge will be installed on surface casing during flowback period <br/>   <br/>24~HOUR PRODUCTION RATE <br/>              <br/>                  <br/>    <br/>  <br/>  <br/>Company Telephone Number Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Com any LP 281 -206-5362 FOR STATE USE ONLY Address <br/>600 N.

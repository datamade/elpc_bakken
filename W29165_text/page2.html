Continuing through the middle portion of the well the Basal Clean marker was contacted several times, conﬁrming well‘s position in zone. Persistent and signiﬁcantly steeper dips continued to make targeting difficult. Over the last few thousand feet of the lateral, targets were raised several times and inclination changed from 90.4 to 90.6 degrees before ﬁnishing at 90.2 degrees. Gamma continued to suggest wellbore was in the center of zone and correlations suggested an approximate average dip of <br/>target formation to be 90.2 degrees. Lithology made several color transitions as wellbore moved down, through basal clean gamma <br/>and then back up into geologic zone, helping confirm gamma correlations and overall wellbore position in the geologic zone. Samples typically showed light blue gray to light gray brown dolomite with dull blue yellow ﬂuorescence and a slow weak cut. Through most of the lateral, total gas typically averaged around 300 — 800 units with slight increases at connections. Well was drilled at an average target inclination 90.4 degrees. Average formation dip for the entire lateral was estimated to be 90.33 degrees, even though formation dips averaged 90.48 degrees for the majority of the lateral. Average formation dip was 0.05 degrees above the original anticipated dip of 90.28 degrees. Upon reaching total depth of the lateral it was <br/>estimated well was drilled 85% in zone. </p>

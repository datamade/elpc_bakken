Two (2) chokes with one (1) remotely controlled from the rig ﬂoor. 8. Two (2) kill line valves and a check valve [two (2) inch minimum]. 9. Upper and lower kelly cock valves with handles available. <br/>10. Safety valve(s) and subs to ﬁt all drill string connections in use. <br/>1 1. Inside BOP or ﬂoat sub available. <br/>12. Pressure gauge on choke manifold. <br/>13. Fill-up line above the uppermost preventer. <br/>B. Pressure Rating: 5,000 psi C. Testing Procedure: Annular Preventer <br/>At a minimum, the Annular Preventer will be pressure tested to 50% of the rated working pressure for the high test. A Low pressure test shall preformed to 250 psia for ﬁve (5) mins and a High pressure test shall be preformed to 2,500 psia for ten (10) minutes. At a minimum, the above pressure test will be performed: <br/>1. When the annular preventer is initially installed; <br/>2. Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken; 3. Following related repairs; and <br/>4. At thirty (30) day intervals. <br/>In addition to the above, the annular preventer will be functionally operated at least weekly. <br/>Blow-Out Preventer <br/>At a minimum, the BOP, choke manifold, and related equipment will be pressure tested to the approved working pressure of the BOP stack (if isolated from the surface casing by a test plug) or to 70% of the internal yield strength of the surface casing (if the BOP is not isolated from the casing by a test plug). Pressure will be maintained for a period of at least ten (10) minutes or until the requirements of the test are met, whichever is longer. A Low pressure test shall preformed to 250 psia for ﬁve (5) mins and a High pressure test shall be preformed to 5,000 psia for ten (10) minutes. At a minimum, the above pressure test will be performed: <br/>1. When the BOP is initially installed; <br/>2. Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken; 3. Following related repairs; and <br/>4. At thirty (30) day intervals. <br/>In addition to the above, the pipe and blind rams will be activated each trip, but not more than once each day. All BOP drills and tests will be recorded in the IADC driller’s log. The Blow-Out Preventer (BOP) and all related pressure control equipment will be certiﬁed for service in a sour gas (H23) environment in compliance with both Onshore Oz'l & Gas Order Number 2 and Onshore Oil & Gas Order Number 6. <br/>D. Choke Manifold Equipment: <br/>All choke lines will be straight lines unless turns use tee blocks or are targeted with running tees, and will be anchored to prevent whip and vibration. </p>

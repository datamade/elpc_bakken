Sandstone, dolomite, and siltstone stringers interbedded and interlaminated through the upper Three Forks. Background gas averaged 150 to 200 units through the end of the curve. </p>

Aﬁer drilling cement and pressure testing casing, the lateral section of the wellbore began drilling ahead shortly before 9:30 AM CST. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Sanish ﬁeld targeting methodology was used for the duration of the lateral wellbore. A 38 foot total targeting window was used, with the top of the window initially set at the top of the Three Forks at 10,406 feet true vertical depth and 10,664 feet measured depth, and projected out at the anticipated over all dip rate of 89.75 degrees. An internal ﬁirther targeting window was set between 15 and 25 feet below the top of the window, with the bottom of the window set 38 feet below the top. The observed dip rate of the lateral was initially steeper than anticipated over <br/>the ﬁrst 2,000 feet, averaging between 89.3 and 8945 degrees, decreasing to between 89.7 and 899 over the last 5,000 feet. <br/>Lateral drilling began shortly before 9:30 AM CST on the 15TH of November, 2014, with drill rates while rotating averaging between 170 and 200 feet per hour, and from 40 to 60 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 274 units, with a 6,155 unit trip gas circulated with bottoms up. A dip rate calculation of 89.37 degrees was made between correlative points at 10,907 and 11,359 feet measured depth. <br/>Samples caught throughout the lateral consisted of shale which was light to medium blue gray, light gray in pan, silty, rough, sub blocky to blocky, speckled, and argillaceous. Samples also consisted of sandstone, which was light to medium brown, tan, buff, cream tan, very ﬁner to ﬁnely grained, silty, fairly to moderately well sorted, unconsolidated in part, and had good intergranular porosity. Cream to cream gray, off white, thin, platy, laminated siltstone with dark gray striations also present in some samples. Composition of samples had higher concentrations of shale and siltstone while logged gamma was above 80 API, and <br/>higher concentrations of sandstone while below 80, a trend which was noted for the duration of the lateral wellbore. <br/>Going into the second day of lateral drilling, the 16TH of November, drill rates continued to average between 180 and 200 feet per hour while rotating, and from 20 to 40 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 752 units. Multiple slides were implemented early in the drilling day to correct the direction of the well path, which was over 170 feet to the right of <br/>the proposed well path. Observed dip averaged 8944 degrees between multiple correlative contacts. </p>

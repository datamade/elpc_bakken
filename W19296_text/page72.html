    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">ST #3 Curve <br/>Set whipstock at 9,171' MD. Started building ST #3 curve at 4: 13 AM on September 19, 2014 <br/>False Bakken MD 10,076’ TVD 9, 760’ SS -7, 702’ <br/>There was a 2’ section of deﬁned False Bakken. ROP averaged 1.06min/ﬁ, while sliding, with background gas of 162 units. A sample from this section; ARGILLACEOUS DOLOSTONE: Dark gray, medium gray, granular, calcareous, moderate induration, no visible porosity, spotty yellow ﬂuorescence, no cut. <br/>Upper Bakken MD 10,131 ’ TVD 9, 779’ SS -7, 721 ’ <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was picked from ROP, gamma and lithology change. ROP was controlled at 1.26 minutes a foot with background gas averaging 55 units with a <br/>high of 253 units. Gamma was off the charts. Typical sample is: SHALE: Black, calcareous, trace sandy, carbonaceous, gritty, blocky, no ﬂuorescence, bright white cut. <br/>Middle Bakken MD 10,184’ TVD 9, 796’ SS - 7, 738’ <br/>The Middle Bakken came in at MD 10,184’; TVD 9,796’. This pick was made off gamma and lithology change. ROP averaged 1.24 minutes a foot with background gas of 101 units. A typical sample for this formation was; ARENACEOUS DOLOMITE: Light brown, light gray, brown, ﬁne to very ﬁne granular, argillaceous, calcareous, silty, ﬁrm to well indurated, trace intergranular porosity, rare dark brown oil staining, even greenish gray ﬂuorescence, fast milky streaming cut. <br/>Lower Bakken 10,274 ’ MD 9,82 7’ T VD -7, 769’ SS <br/>The Lower Bakken was entered at TVD 9,827’ and was 35’ thick. ROP while drilling and sliding was 0.46 min/ﬂ with 159 units of background gas. A typical sample was; SHALE: Black, carbonaceous, dolomitic, smooth, platy, faint yellow ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy cut. <br/>Three Forks 10,427’ MD 9,862’ T VD -7,804’ SS <br/>The Three Forks formation was entered at TVD 9,862’. ROP 1.01 min/ft and background gas of 157 units. A typical sample to this point was; DOLOSTONE: Light brown, tan, microcrystalline, pyrite, massive, argillaceous, trace arenaceous, trace ﬁne sucrosic, poor to well induration, trace intercrystalline porosity, trace shale, bluish green, trace limestone, wackestone to packstone, cream, soﬁ, chalky, tight, trace dark brown oil staining, faint spotty yellow ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy cut. The curve was landed at 10,610’ MD at 12:01am on September 21, 2014 in the Three Forks lst bench. We tripped out to run casing and cement. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Lateral #1 MD 10,610’ ——MD 27,141’ <br/>Drilling of the horizontal started at 11:45am on September 24 2014. The target zone for this well is 10’ thick with the curve landing 7’ Higher than target zone. Upon drilling out of casing the plan was to drill down in formation to get into the target zone. We started the lateral with a formation dip of 89.45. On September 26, 2014 the formation dip was calculated to a dip of 89.70 based upon on correlating gamma starting at 13,000’ MD. At Ml) 14,695 the decision was made to TOOH for new motor and bit. We got back to bottom and started drilling at 6:20pm on September 27, 2014. Aﬁer switching geology crews and drilling only 8’, the Lower Bakken Shale was struck at 14,703’ MD! It was decided to trip back to 14,296’ MD and sidetrack. This is sidetrack #4 on this well. The approved plan was to move down 17’ in TVD and continue ahead with an 89.20 degree dip target. The borehole moved down over 50’ in TVD in 800’ of MD and the borehole passes through the center of the target zone. It then passed through the low gamma just below the center of the target zone. It then dropped into the next high gamma point below the target zone. The descent was stopped and the borehole was kept ﬂat while we moved up through the section. The borehole moved up into the lower gamma above the center target and is near the center target high gamma marker. The calculated dip on the center target high gamma marker was 89.19 degrees when compared to the last time we saw it. This was very close to the target of 90.20 degrees. The borehole moved down during the next day of drilling, but not as fast as the formation was dropping. The low gamma just below the Lower Bakken Shale was found at 20,365’ Nﬂ), 10.009.12’ TVD. We exited this area at 20,462’ MD, 10,013.30’ TVD. This was an 87.30 degree local dip. We continued to move down and the MWD survey tool failed at 20,911’ MD at 10:45 AM CT on October 2, 2014. The overall dip found on the low gamma area just below the shale was found to be around 89.14 degrees when compared to the start of the well. The target dip was changed at 18,000' md from 89.20 to 8904 degrees. The borehole appears to be just above the target zone in the 70's gamma area. The rig tripped and changed the BHA and added an agitator. Drilling resumed at 10:00 PM CT on October 3, 2014. The target dip was changed by the ofﬁce to 89.10 degrees. The borehole moved down into the center target area. The borehole continued to move down into the low gamma below the center target area and started into the next high gamma point. The dip calculated on the high gamma at 22275' compared to 16760' md is 89.22 degrees. Drilling stopped at 22897' md at about 9 PM on October 4, 2014 when sliding became difﬁcult. The rig tripped back to 18600’ and they are tripping back into the hole. Aﬁer the short pipe trip, drilling resumed at about 10:00 AM CT on October 5, 2014. Drilling stopped at 23,118' MD at about 3: 15 PM CT. A 10 to 15 stand wiper trip was planned. Drilling resumed at about 12:15 AM CT. It appears the borehole moved up from marker #5 into marker #4, the center target area. It then moved up more and into marker #3. Drilling stopped at 23,556' MD at about 12: 15 PM CT on October 6, 2014 then tripped back to 22,683' MD and started sidetrack #5. The sidetrack ﬁnished at 9:30 AM CT and the drilling of the lateral resumed. The borehole dropped and may have struck the Bench #2. Drilled back up formation to ﬁnd correlating gamma markers. TD of 27,141 was reached on October 9, 2014. TOOH and picked up reamer assembly. Bottoms up maxed out gas equipment at 9998 units and greenish gray oil was seen ﬂowing over </p>

The average rate of penetration was 1.09 min/ﬂ and background gas averaged 333 units with a max of 602 units. Consistency of gamma markers with correlating wells throughout the curve section prompted a preservation of the initial target landing of 11,086’ TVD. The TD of the curve was reached at 11,380' MD on February 24, 2015 around 11:50 AM., CST and 7 Inch Casing was set at 11,355 1W), 11,087.4’ TVD. The curve was landed just over 6’ feet into the target window and just over 21’ into the Middle Bakken. The target zone ranged between 15’ and 25’ feet below the top of the Middle Bakken Member. Samples became increasingly carbonaceous and microsucrosic as the curve section progressed into the target zone The overall color hierarchy changed ﬁom gray to brown and silt content decreased. </p>

Sampled lithology consisted of Limestone: Light brown to brown, light gray brown to brown, tan, cream, light gray to gray, and occasionally off-white. Lithological characteristics were microcrystalline, microsucrosic, moderately indurated, with varying amount of silt, from trace to moderate, with an occasional presence of sand; samples were ﬁrm, soft in part, carbonaceous, with poor to fair intercrystalline porosity and even to even pinpoint dull yellow to yellow green ﬂuorescence. Cuts were slow to fast thin streaming, with a weak to occasionally fair cloudy presentation. </p>

The lateral section began with a formation apparent dip projection of approximately 90.4 degrees, which was based on previous well data and an interpretation of local geological structure. Drilling progressed until the warm gamma signature in the upper reaches of the target window was encountered just prior to the wellbore exiting the top of the window at 12,391’ h/ﬂ), 11,077.5’ TVD. Directional drilling returned the wellbore back to target 309’ feet later at 12,700’ 1W), 11,076.1’ TVD. Using gamma markers, a 90.3 degree overall and local dip was calculated and the formation was reprojected to reﬂect that change. Drilling ahead in the lateral, the wellbore again exited the top of the window brieﬂy at 12,902’ MD, 11,07 57 ’ TVD. <br/>From 13,000’ MD to 15,000’ MD, the rate of penetration averaged 0.31 min/ft. The background gases averaged 2,232 units with a maximum of 10,000 units. The bit reentered the top of the target widow quickly at 13,03 5’ MD, 11,075.9’ TVD, and the vertical section was utilized to calculate an apparent dip of 89.9 degrees which revealed a slight downward trend in the formation. This was interpreted as a brief undulation and the formation was re-projected at a slightly ﬂatter dip of 90.2 degree, supported by local structure data. At this point, the drilling plan was adjusted to have the directional drilling team bring the wellbore up through the target window slowly at an inclination just above projected dip to identify the warm gamma signature in the upper section of the target window. After a formation-based defection in the center of the window, the wellbore </p>

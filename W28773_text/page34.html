Approximately 18th psi on the casing. Two other wells on the pad also have pressure. The pressure was noticed by the drilling rig after drilling the third well on the pad. Knowledge of exactly where the influx is coming from is unknown. Consequently they brought cement back to the surface casing on the remaining three (C, E, 8: F) and were able to isolate the inﬂux. The 9 SIB" shoe for the 8 well Is at 2,205' and T06 is at 4,750'. The rlg capped the wells upon movin oft location. Completion came in to pad prep the wells, bled off the pressure on the surfaco casing, pumped 50 bbis of brine down the casing to keep the pressure off, and ntppled down the caps and installed tubing heads. <br/>The next step requested to take, is to monitor the backside pressure between the 7" and 9 5! " casing, and bleed off regularly before we free the well. We will run a free string and continue to monitor during the free, cleanout. and flowback. Once completions is finished and the wells are producing. we will monitor, bleed and re-evaluate the necessary steps to proceed if conditions have not changed. <br/>  <br/>    <br/>        <br/>Company Telephone Number XTO Energy (303) 397-3718 Address  “"6 En lewood CO 80112 . .4 ‘ I x...

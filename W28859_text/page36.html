The Mission Canyon came in 16’ low to prognosis. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.40 to 1.30 minutes per foot and averaged 0.58 minutes per foot. Samples from the upper Mission Canyon were majority light gray tan limestone. Samples transitioned to cream tan dolomite in the last half of the Mission Canyon. Average porosity through the Mission Canyon was good. Total gas ranged from 56 to 269 units and averaged 132 <br/>units. </p>

The Lodgepole came in 17 ’ high to prognosis. Drill rates in the Lodgepole to kick off point ranged from 0.40 to 1.77 minutes per foot, and averaged 0.79 minutes per foot. Samples in the upper Lodgepole were generally tan gray limestone with overall poor porosity. Total gas ranged from 17 to 157 units and averaged 85 units. Kick off point of 9,800’ was reached at 11:30 am on August 5, 2014. </p>

The landing target was to be 11’ into the Three Forks formation, initially set at 10,226’ TVD. Trip gas at kick off point peaked at 140 units. Drilling rates in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged from 0.47 to 3.17 minutes per foot, averaging 0.77 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged ﬁom 17 to 309 units, averaging 120 units. Samples in the lower Lodgepole were majority light gray to light gray tan limestone with overall poor to fair porosity. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the curve to correlate to the Solberg 11—2H and 21-2H wells, which are located on the same pad. <br/>False Bakken 10,156’ MD 10,102’ TVD -7, 792’ SS Scallion 1 01 63 ’ MD 1 01 07’ T VD -7, 79 7’ SS Upper Bakken Shale 10,1 75’ 114D 10,114’ TVD -7,804’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was encountered 1’ high to prognosis, the Scallion was even, and the upper Bakken shale came in 1’ high. The top of the upper Bakken Shale was picked at a sharp increase in rate of penetration and change in sample from limestone to shale. Gamma also spiked, reaching as high as 633 AP]. Background gas ranged from 236 to 847 units, averaging 717 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.37 to 1.03 minutes per foot, averaging 0.61 minutes per foot. The upper Bakken was described as very dark gray to black shale with no visible porosity and a bright fast streaming cut. </p>

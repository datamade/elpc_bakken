    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The lateral began with the wellbore approximately 2’ below the base of the target window. A 40 degree turn was planned for the beginning of the lateral, necessitating a higher slide percentage. While sliding to make the turn directional drillers were also able to slide upward in order to reencounter the base of the clean, which occurred at 11,723’. Dip rate of 90. 12 degrees was calculated between 10,517’ to 11,723’. A slight updip was expected, since the wellbore was drilled slightly to the east before turning south. In the interval from 10,533’ to 11,723’ rate of penetration ranged from 0.20 to 2.93 minutes per foot and averaged 0.39 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 17 to 2374 units and averaged 91 units. Gamma ranged from 58 to 173 API and averaged 136 API. Samples were generally described as: Sandstone; cream, off white, very light cream gray, cream tan, translucent in part, very ﬁne, subrounded, poor to moderately sorted, pyritic, argillaceous, poorly cemented; 5% shale, very light green, very light gray, pyritic, smooth, ﬁssile; 5% siltstone, cream gray, light blue gray, very light gray, laminated, platy; scattered pyrite; fair porosity; scattered dull yellow green pinpoint ﬂuorescence, fast streaming, cloudy yellow cut. The majority of this interval was drilled in the two feet under the base of the target window. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The turn was completed at 12,050’ measured depth when an azimuth of 180 degrees was reached. The remainder of the turn was drilled in the target window. In the interval from 11,723’ to 12,050’ the rate of penetration ranged from 0.23 to 1.20 minutes per foot and averaged 0.44 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 17 to 651 units and averaged 321 units. Gamma ranged from 42 to 89 API and averaged 62 API. Samples were generally described as sandstone; cream, cream tan, very ﬁne, subrounded to subangular, moderately sorted, poorly cemented, dolomitic cement; 5% shale, light green, very light gray green, pyritic, smooth, ﬁssile; 5% siltstone, very light gray, laminated, platy; rare pyrite; fair porosity; scattered green pinpoint ﬂuorescence, milky green faint streaming cut. <br/>Drilling continued in the clean gamma until reaching the warm gamma at the top of the target window at 12,619’. Several slides were put in to try to get the wellbore to drop back down into the clean gamma, but it appears the hot gamma which is approximately 2’ below the top of the target window acts as a hard streak when trying to drop down through it. At 13,155’ the clean gamma was again encountered at which time a dip rate of 89.8 degrees was calculated from 12,619’ to 13,155’. Samples were similar, but carried as much as 30% green shale. In this interval the rate of penetration ranged from 0.20 to 2.80 and averaged 0.40 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 17 to 1858 units and averaged 560 units. Gamma ranged from 52 to 130 API and averaged 98 AP]. <br/>Sliding continued to bring the wellbore lower in zone, reaching the hot gamma at the base of the window at 13,361 ’. Dip rate of 89.7 degrees calculated from 11,723’ to 13,361’. In the interval from 13,155’ to 13,361’ samples were similar to those from the previous intervals drilled in the clean gamma. Gas and gamma values were also similar. </p>

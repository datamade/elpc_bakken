The following assurances apply: 1. The fracture treatment will be pumped down the 7” casing, with treating pressures and pressure tests complying with NDIC guidelines. 2. The well is equipped with new 29# HCP-110 & 32# HCP-110 csg w/min API burst rating of 11,220 psi. 3. The annulus pressure will be monitored throughout the treatment, and any damage would be detected immediately. 4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flow back than during the frac job. 5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates 6. A production packer and tubing will be installed as soon as possible after the initial frac cleanup stage. 7.

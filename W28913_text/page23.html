Thirty foot surveys were taken through the duration of the turn, as required by North Dakota state requirements. The ideal geological window targeted a drilling line 34' into the Three Forks formation with a hard line set at 50‘. Halfway through the azimuth turn a target adjustment was made to equate the target window with expected formation dip: target adjustment #2 lowered target line 4’ and slightly lowered inclination to 89.7 degrees. The turn was continued along new targets until 13,120’ MD where it was completed and the directional team returned to taking ninety foot surveys for the duration of the lateral. Formation ran even with expected dip for the majority of the next 6,550’, but this was difﬁcult to conﬁrm as an apparent hard streak in the lower half of the target window made it very difﬁcult for the directional team to slide up into the upper half of zone to confirm dip with gamma. The high gamma values did not align with the offset very well, so gamma conﬁrmation was necessary. After struggling for approximately 2000’ to slide up into the upper section of zone, target adjustment #3 raised the target line 4’ while maintaining the existing 89.7 degree target inclination. After raising the target line the directional team was able to slide more aggressively and move into the upper section of the target window. With permission from the Operations Geologist in Houston, the wellbore brieﬂy left the target window to complete a gamma wrap. Formation dip was conﬁrmed between 89.6 — 89.7 degrees and the remainder of the lateral was drilled with no additional target adjustments. After a standard survey 130’ from proposed total depth the motor failed to resume, and the decision was made to end the lateral at this point. The well was completed 2’ high of the target drilling line, in the upper half of the ideal geological window. <br/>Total depth was reached on December 1, 2014 at 12:25 pm. CST at a measured depth of 20,680’ and a true vertical depth of 10,833.19’. The Three Forks lateral took a total of 4 days and 21 hours to complete, including surveys and down time. The lateral was drilled approximately 90% in zone with an average background gas of 76 units (including connection gases). Average drill rate was 153 ft/hr including slides, with max ROP reaching 275 ft/hr continuously in sections. The EN-VP&R—154-94-2536H-1 bottom hole location would be 901 .98' FSL & 575.25' FEL in Section 36 T154N R94W. </p>

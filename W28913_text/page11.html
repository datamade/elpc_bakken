    <p class="styleSans9.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Gas Liﬁ Technology: <br/>Gas lift technology pushes high pressured gas down a well in order to lift oil that was not obtainable by other means. A portion of the natural gas produced from the well is cycled through a compressor to "pressurize" the gas which is then sent down hole. The remaining produced natural gas from the well is put into sales or flared. The "pressurized" gas returns to the surface with the produced oil and repeats the <br/>cycle. Some gas lift technologies burn part of the produced gas in a reciprocating engine as part of the compression process. Other gas lift technologies are a closed system which would not reduce any flaring onsite. <br/>Hess is not currently utilizing this system because compressed gas is piped from the TGP for gas lift wells. The company continues to evaluate this technology on remote well locations. <br/>Bi-Fuel Rig Conversion: <br/>Bi-Fuel Conversion is a process where diesel engines are converted to operate on a combination of diesel fuel and natural gas. <br/>Hess has partnered with Nabors Drilling to equip six "PACE B" rigs operating in the Bakken with Bi-Fuel Kits. GTi Altronics is a retroﬁt technology allowing diesel engines to operate on a mixture of natural gas and diesel fuel. Boiler sheds will be converted to run on 100% natural gas during winter operations. The units have a gas requirement of 50%. The Bl-Fuel System required approximately 75-100 MSCFD and the boilers require approx. 100-150 MSCFD. <br/>Hess is unable to utilize this technology on depleted wells lacking gas production. Well surging creating <br/>intermittent gas supply is another issue related to Bi-Fuel usage. Safety is also a concom as the system requires aboveground gas lines. <br/>Natural Gas Generators: <br/>Natural Gas Generators are an alternative to diesel generators to provide electricity to well pads located in remote areas. The units are tied directly into the natural gas production onsite and supplement liquid propane for use during hourly production fluctuation. Natural gas generators require liquid propane to be used when gas is not being produced from the well. As production of gas increases and decreases hourly, the units may switch from propane to natural gas and then back to propane. <br/>Hess performed two pilot programs to evaluate performance characteristics of natural gas generators from two manufacturers. Both manufacturers require further development to increase their reliability and performance of units. </p>

The systems strips out NGLs from the gas stream and refrigerates them for storage reducing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) thereby mitigating environmental Impacts by significantly decreasing emissions from flare stacks. The Units can be combined and scaled up to handle high volumes of gas. <br/>Hess has contracted with GTUIT to provide mobile gas treatment units (MTUs). As of 6/23/2014, Hess has five GTUIT units being utilized in the field and expects delivery of three additional units by 8/1/2014. The units have capacities ranging from 500 MSCFD to 1,000 MSCFD and can be relocated from one site to another. The units also can be linked onsite to provide a larger daily capacity intake. <br/>Hess is developing methodologies that will result in an order-of-merit list of candidate sites at which to deploy the MTUs, based on environmental, regulatory, economic, and operational factors. There are commercial constraints present which pertain to Hess’s commercial agreement with GTUIT; wells must produce at least half of the MSCFD unit capacity and cover the initial connection fees in order for use of <br/>the GTUIT unit to be economic. </p>

Eight Lodgepole markers were recorded before reaching kick off point at 10,330' MD. KOP was reached at 8:30 am on November 21, 2014. The rig then pulled out of the hole to pick up the build curve assembly. <br/>Build Curve <br/>The EN-VP&R-154-94—2536H-1 build curve began on November 22, 2014 at a measured depth of 10,330' in the mid portion of the Lodgepole formation and was drilled with an average drill rate of 60-80 ft/hr while sliding and rotating. The Lodgepole consisted of soft to ﬁrm limestone, that is also light gray, gray, and light gray brown in color. Landing estimations ﬂuctuated as high as 10,786' TVD and as low as 10,797' TVD throughout the Lodgepole formation with the original projected TVD set at 10,753' TVD. The ideal landing was set at 10, 792’ TVD once recording the top of the Three Forksformation at 1 0, 758 ' T VD. <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale formation was encountered at the base of the Lodgepole formation at a MD of 10,654' and a TVD of 10,616'. The lithology of shale was black in color and very carbonaceous with fair yellow oil shows. The top of the Bakken shale was 4' low from projection which projected the estimated landing to 10,795' TVD. After 29' MD and 20' TVD the base of the Bakken Shale was reached and the top of the Middle Bakken was encountered at a MD of 10,683' and TVD of 10,636', projecting landing at 10,789' TVD. Lithology moved from carbonaceous shale to light brown to brown to light brown gray sandstone. Shows maintained fair quality with yellow cuts. Drill rates decreased slightly and averaged 50-60 ft/hr while rotating and sliding. Continued to drill the Middle Bakken formation on the way to the Lower Bakken Shale which was encountered at a measured depth of 10,780' MD and a TVD of 10,702‘, trending along with projection. The lithology of the Lower Bakken Shale was similar to the upper shale and consisted of black carbonaceous shale, fairly brittle, with interbedded pyrite. Oil shows continued to be good quality and background gas ranged 150 to 1,100 units. Entered the lower shale at approximately 54 degree inclination and exited at 70 degrees inclination in the Three Forks formation. The Three Forks formation was recorded after a gamma count decrease below 150 units at 10,902' MD and 10,758' TVD, conﬁrming the final landing at 10,792' TVD which targeted 34' into the formation. Lithology moved to a light gray to light blue gray to tan sandstone, which is fairly calcareous, argillaceous in parts, with good oil shows present. The EN-VP&R-154-94-2536H-1 build curve was landed at 11,100' MD and 10,798.77’ TVD on November 23, 2014 at 3:30 pm. CST. The rig proceeded to ream the curve wellbore and trip out to lay down build curve tools before picking up 7" casing. <br/>Lateral Three Forks <br/>The EN-VP&R-lS4-94-2536H-1 Three Forks lateral began on November 26, 2014 at 11,100’ MD and a TVD of 10,789.77' after completing the build curve. Initial targets were set at 90.0 degrees based off the EN FREDA 154-94-2536 H-S Three Forks lateral. The center target line was set 9’ below landing location. Immediately upon starting the lateral the gamma data appeared to be approximately 40 units higher than expected. This was discussed between the MWD, directional, and geology personnel and was determined to be nothing hazardous to drilling (conclusions discussed: perhaps the tool was either calibrated to read higher values or this area of the Three Forks contained warmer gamma signatures, etc). The directional team drilled down to the center line before starting the 35 degree azimuth turn 11,178’ MD to move </p>

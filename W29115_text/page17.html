Botany Any sensitive or watch plant species found at a later date in the project area should be protected <br/>and their habitats should be managed to protect the species. This will be coordinated with the Forest Service Botanist. <br/>03. Chemicals and Storage <br/>A. Chemicals: Upon request, the Operator will provide the Forest Service with an inventory of the kinds, amounts, and hazards of all chemicals, additives, mud materials, and/or any other substances used during drilling and/or production of the well. <br/>B. Storage: All containers used for chemical storage during production will be properly labeled with chemical name and hazards. The maximum number of chemical containers on location shall not exceed two (2) per chemical type unless authorized by the Forest Service prior to use. Excess containers shall be neatly stored and empty containers shall be promptly removed. Chemical containers laid or turned on their side shall be supported off the ground in a sturdy <br/>cradle or stand equipped with a drip pan or catch basin. <br/>04. Cultural Resources If, prior to or during any disturbance activity, items of archaeological, paleontological, or historic <br/>value are reported or discovered, or an unknown deposit of such items is disturbed, the Operator will immediately cease disturbance activities in the affected area and notify the Forest Service. Disturbance activities will not resume until the District Ranger gives approval. <br/>05. Dikes If production facilities are constructed, each and every vessel containing production fluids of any <br/>kind must be surrounded on all four sides by an impermeable dike/berm of sufficient capacity to adequately contain the contents of the largest vessel within the dike plus one day's production. Dike material shall be free of oil, saltwater and/or other waste materials. Dike capacity will be calculated at the lowest point on the dike. Therefore, metal walkway(s) over the dike are encouraged so as to prevent the wearing down or beating down of the dike walls. Vessel containing facilities include but are not limited to individual tanks, tank batteries, heatertreaters, separators, line heaters, etc. Dikes shall be kept bare of all living and/or dead vegetation. </p>

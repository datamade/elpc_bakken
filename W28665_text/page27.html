Based on currently NDIC approved or applied for QEP spacing units, this could imply 2 to 16 commingled wells per surface location. <br/>Each pad with common interest wells will be setup with a “test train” and “bulk train” of equipment consisting of a two phase separator, heater treater, allocation meters, storage tanks, divert tank, and sales meters. Each wellhead is piped into both the bqu train and the test train. Directional ﬂow is managed by a manual valve that is changed by the operator. To test the wells and determine proper individual well allocations, each well on location will be run through the test train of equipment for an allotted period of <br/>time. (First Pod of Wells) Scenario <br/>1. Flow Back a. One well getting tested at a time through ﬂow back equipment <br/>b. Two days worth of ﬂowing back and testing for each well i. There is a Test System and a Bulk System with a row of tanks associated with each system 2. Immediately Following Flow Back a. Need a ‘snapshot’ of production to reset our original test numbers i. However many hour tests per well to include all the wells in a 24 hr period of time b. Gives us percentages that can be applied to the actual calculated daily production c. Multiple days of ‘snapshot’ testing to monitor the wells’ declines 3. Steady Flow 1 a. Will test each well for 24 hrs i. Automation will be installed for the 24 hr testing 1. Facilities are setup for manual testing as well ii. With the automation we can have a well in a 24 hr test everyday with no issues <br/>(Second Pod of Wells) Scenario <br/>1. New wells will be tested as described in the (First Pod of Wells) Scenario section. 2. All existing wells will be in the Bulk System during ﬂow back operations and will not be <br/>available for testing a. At this time the ﬁrst wells will be in a more steady ﬂow rate decline and much more <br/>predictable b. Once ﬂow back is complete, we will enter into ‘Snapshot Test’ mode to resct all of our <br/>old and original tests <br/>  </p>

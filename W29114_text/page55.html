Therefore, it is extremely important that these herbicides not be used to control noxious weeds and/or invasive species, as defined by COA Other #37-15, within those areas of the pad or road where native vegetative cover is being established under interim or final reclamation. <br/>Chemical Treatment The following mitigation measures shall apply to the ground application of all herbicides: <br/>General All chemical treatments must be approved in writing by the Forest Service prior to any surface <br/>application. A copy ofthe approval must be present on the site being treated. Failure to produce a copy of the approval may result in immediate shut down of operations. <br/>Applications, Forms, Monitoring Companies using herbicides for vegetative control or for control of noxious weeds and/or invasive species must annually complete, submit, and have approved prior to use the following documents: <br/>a. Pesticide-Use Proposal (Form FS—2100-2). b. Pesticide-Use Proposal Attachment A, Supplemental information (Form DPG-2100-2A). <br/>c. Spill Incident Response Plan for transporting herbicides. <br/>A current and blank copy of forms 2100—2 and 2100-2A can be obtained from the Forest Service District Office upon request. <br/>Do not combine vegetative control use with control of noxious weeds and/or invasive species use on the same forms. Separate forms must be submitted for each. <br/>Herbicides Oniy approved herbicides, as specified within the 2007 Dakota Prairie Grasslands Noxious Weed <br/>Management Project can be used for chemical treatment. Since this listing may change from year to year, it is the Operator's responsibility to request and submit use for the most current listing of approved herbicides. An approved current listing of vegetative control herbicides can be obtained <br/>from the Forest Service District Office upon request. <br/>Ground Application 0 Herbicides must be applied under the supervision of a certified herbicide applicator under the laws of the State of North Dakota. 0 Herbicides must be applied consistent with the instructions on the label. - No herbicide will be applied directly to surface water or where surface water from treated areas can run into iive water sources. <br/>0 A buffer of at least one hundred (100) feet from bodies of water must be maintained. 0 The buffer width \A/niilri hr: rintprminm-i hnenni nh cnil elnhn e+r~ </p>

No spraying of liquid formulations will be done if the wind velocity exceeds ten (10) mph or per herbicide labeling directions. If boom spraying is done, boom pressure will not exceed forty (40) psi to minimize drift. Herbicide use will be permitted only within the areas identified within the applications. A sign saying the area has been treated with herbicides will be posted in areas receiving treatments at least one full day (unless the herbicide label says longer) after the treatment. </p>

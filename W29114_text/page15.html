Poles for outdoor lights, if approved, shall not exceed (30) thirty feet in height. Poles will be buried a minimum of six (6) feet deep. <br/>07. Erosion Control <br/>The Operator shall prevent and control soil erosion and landslides. Soils and topsoil stockpiles shall be stabilized and vegetated with approved native species. The Operator shall take prompt action to stabilize, repair, and re-vegetate eroded or washed areas and prevent gullying. Forest Service approval is required prior to any earth disturbing activity. <br/>08. Facilities (Equipment and Accessories) <br/>A. Existing Facilities and Improvements: The Operator shall protect, in place, all existing facilities and/or improvements; underground flowlines, pipelines, electric lines, etc.; and shall repair or replace any damage as a result of actions or operations from this well. <br/>B. Production Facilities Location: The production facilities and tanks for this well will be located: <br/>  <br/>X 0n 7 Off X Federal Lease (__) Private Mineral Estate m4 NWNW Section: 22 ‘1 Township: 153N jRange: 96W <br/>  <br/>C. Production Facilities Plan: The volume of production determines the amount of production facilities needed. Prior to siting production facilities, the Operator shall notify the Forest Service and request a prework meeting/field review. During that meeting it shall be determined if the SUPO or PO adequately covers the actual production needs. If the SUPO or PO is sufficient, the facilities can be set. A distance of 125 feet must be maintained between all production facilities (i.e. between wellbore and heater treater, wellbore and tanks, etc.) unless approved otherwise by the Forest Service. <br/>If the SUPO or PO is not sufficient and additional facilities are needed, the Operator must amend their SUPO by Sundry Notice (Form 3160-5) for federal leases or by a similar form or letter to amend their private mineral PO to adjust for additional production facility needs. All Sundry Notices must be approved by the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service for federal leases and by the Forest Service for private minerals prior to implementation and must include needed adjustments to the Production Facilities and Reclamation Plan. <br/>Deferred Facilities Option For Federal Lease SUPO’s: If, at the time the original APD was filed, the lessee or Operator elected to defer submitting information under Section |ll.D.4.d. (Location of Existing and/or Proposed Facilities) of the SUPO, the lessee or Operator must supply this information before construction and installation of the facilities as described in Section D. Changes To Production Facilities. The Forest Service may require a field inspection and additional environmental analysis may also be required before approving the proposal. The lessee or Operator may not begin construction until the Bureau of Land Management/Forest Service approves the proposed plan in writing. <br/>D. Siting Production Facilities on Fill: It is undesirable to locate production facilities on fill material because of settling. However, in the event that the tank battery or heater treater(s) cannot be located on the cut portion of the pad, the fill material beneath must be compacted according to T99, Method C specifications as described in Section 204.11(c), of FP-03 Standard Specifications and Supplements for Construction of Roads and Bridges on Federal Highway Projects. T99, Method C compaction generally cannot be achieved between freeze-up through spring thaw. Therefore, siting permanent production facilities after freeze—up and prior to spring thaw will not be allowed, unless approved by the Forest Service in writing. </p>

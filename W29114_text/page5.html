    <p class="styleSans24.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">surface area would be 420 feet by 420 feet in size with total disturbance being approximately 4.6 acres. The proposed access road follows NFSR #867 in Sections 22 and 15. Approximately 2,703 feet of NFSR #867 would be upgraded in the SE portion of Section 22 from the intersection of NFSR #8814 northwest to where the road would cross onto pn'vate surface. The access road would continue northwesterly, where it reenters Federal surface in the NW of Section 22 for 209 feet and an additional 206 feet in the SW of Section 15. Utilities, which could include underground electric, ﬁber optic, oil, saltwater, freshwater, and natural gas lines, would parallel the proposed access road. Total disturbance for new construction, including the well pad, access, and utilities, would be approximately 12.1 acres. <br/>The proposed Newﬁeld Sand Creek Federal 153-96-21-28 well pad would include three wells: the Sand Creek Federal 153-96-21-28-2H, Sand Creek Federal 153-96-21-3H, and Sand Creek Federal 153-96-21-28-10H. The well pad would be located in the NENE Section 21, T.153N., R.96W., 5‘h PM, McKenzie County, North Dakota (see attached map). The well pad surface area would be 420 feet by 420 feet in size with total disturbance being approximately 4.7 acres. The access road would follow NF SR #867 from the Helsingborg 153-96-22-27 northwest through the SW of Section 15 for approximately 1,042 feet, where it would cross onto State surface. There the road turns southwest and reenters Federal surface in Section 21 for an additional 197 feet. Utilities, which could include underground electric, ﬁber optic, oil, saltwater, freshwater, and natural gas lines, would parallel the proposed access road. Total disturbance for new construction, including the well pad, access, and utilities, would be approximately 8.3 acres. <br/>The Sand Creek State #153-96-16-2H well is being proposed on State land in Section 16, T.153N., R.96W., 5lh PM, McKenzie County, North Dakota (see attached map). This access road will also be used to access Newﬁeld’s Sand Creek Federal 153-96-21-28 and Helsingborg Federal 153-96-22-27 well pads. It would be constructed from NFSR #8811-1 near the existing Sand Creek State 1-16H well site in the NW of Section 21. The access road crosses Federal surface for approximately 2,442 feet through the north portion of Section 21 before turning into Section 16. Utilities, which could include underground electric, ﬁber optic, oil, saltwater, freshwater, and natural gas lines, would parallel the proposed access road. This access and utility corridor would disturb approximately 8.3 acres <br/>In addition, a utility corridor would parallel NFSR #881 from the SE corner of Section 29 and continue north to the junction of NF SR #881-1 in Section 20. An electric line and oil, gas, and saltwater pipelines would parallel NFSR #881 for approximately 7,993 feet. The corridor would continue adjacent to NF SR #8811-1 for 1,035 feet in Section 20. It would then enter private surface and reenter Federal surface in the NW of Section 21 for an additional 1,360 feet, connecting into the proposed utilities adjacent to the Sand Creek State #153-96-16-2H access road (see attached map). Utilities could include underground electric, ﬁber optic, oil, saltwater, freshwater, and natural gas lines and would disturb approximately 17.8 acres. </p>

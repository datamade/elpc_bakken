Safety <br/>The Operator shall maintain structures, facilities, improvements, and equipment in a safe and neat <br/>manner and must take appropriate measures to protect the public from hazardous sites or conditions resulting from the operations. <br/>28. Seed Mixtures and Seeding Seeding shall be accomplished as agreed to in the SUPO or PO reclamation plan(s). <br/>A. Mixtures: The native seed mixture listed in Other Conditions of Approval, shall be used for seeding all reclamation work completed within one (1) year of completion of this well. The Operator shall request from the Forest Service updated seed mixtures for any seeding <br/>accomplished after the one-year period. Approved cover crops are included within the native seed mixtures. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">B. Report of Seeding and Certification: The mixture shall be lab tested to identify the noxious and invasive weed seed present and certified weed free by the Seed Company. A copy of the certification including the purity and viability of the seed mix shall be supplied to the Forest Service prior to planting. Upon completion of the planting, a Report of Seeding (COA Other #37288) from the Operator or the seeding contractor shall be submitted to the Forest Service verifying that the seeding is completed. <br/>C. Seeding and/or Planting Dates: The best success rates for seeding or planting are normally from the end of spring thaw to May 15 orfrom October 1 to freeze-up. Seeding will be repeated annually until such areas are accepted in writing by the District Ranger as being satisfactorily revegetated (3-5 years average but may take longer) and stabilized. <br/>D. Seeding Methods: Seeding shall be completed with grass seeders or small rangeland drills. Large grain drills are not allowed. Rangeland drills are designed to seed the larger diameter seed and seed mixes that are uniform in size. Rangeland drills should be and typically are equipped with a broadcast (dribble) box that drops the smaller diameter seed if applicable, onto the surface. A drag implement attached will provide a light soil cover over the small diameter seed. All planting will be parallel to contours and use of criss-cross patterns to prevent erosion. <br/>Broadcast seeding. by hand or by hand held seed Spreaders or with ATV mounts are allowed only on areas where it is too steep for drill equipment. When broadcast seeding, twice the normal seed mixture rate will be used. Areas broadcasted shall be raked or dragged to ensure a minimum of half-inch soil coverage over the seed. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">E. Seed Beds: The seedbed should be thoroughly worked, firm. and free of clods. Drill row spacing should be about two (2) inches. Seeding depths vary from â€œA to 1/2 inch deep and should be no deeper than one half (V2) inch. Seeding deeper than one (1) inch will result in a poor stand. <br/>F. Mulches: A variety of mulching techniques may be required on disturbed slopes to hold seed. These sites will be mulched using certified weed free clean straw or native grass hay. Mulching should not include native hay unless livestock have been excluded from the hayed site. <br/>G. Geotextiles: Seed and soil blankets, known as erosion control fabric and/or other names, may be used to stabilize disturbed areas. <br/>H. Fertilizers: Fertilizers may be used with prior written approval from the District Ranger. </p>

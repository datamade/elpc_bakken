    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">DECISION <br/>Based upon my review of the Tarpon Federal 24-20, Tarpon Federal 44-19, Helsingborg Federal 153-96-22-27, and Sand Creek Federal 153-96-21-28 Oil and Gas Wells, Access Roads, and Utilities Environmental Assessment (EA), I have decided to approve the Surface Use Plan of Operations and road design plans submitted by Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation (Whiting) and Newﬁeld Production Company (Newﬁeld) for construction of the well pads, access roads, and utilities. <br/>The proposed Whiting Tarpon Federal 24-20 well pad will include ﬁve wells: the Tarpon Federal 24-20-1H, Tarpon Federal 24-20-2H, Tarpon Federal 24-20-3H, Tarpon Federal 24-2OTFH, and Tarpon Federal 24 20-2TFH. The well pad would be located in the SESW Section 20, T. l 53N., R.96W., 5'11 PM, McKenzie County, North Dakota (see attached map). The well pad would be irregularly shaped due to location constraints and would disturb approximately 4.8 acres. The proposed access road begins at the junction of NF SR #881 and NF SR #881-3 in the SWSE of Section 20. NFSR #881-3 would be upgraded to access the site for approximately 1,592 feet in Section 20. Utilities, which could include underground electric, ﬁber optic, oil, saltwater, freshwater, and natural gas lines, would parallel the proposed access road. Total disturbance for new construction, including the well pad, access, and utilities, would be approximately 9.6 acres. <br/>The proposed Whiting Tarpon Federal 44-19 well pad will include six wells: the Tarpon Federal 44-19-1H, Tarpon Federal 44 19-2H, Tarpon Federal 44-19-3H, Tarpon Federal 44-19TFH, Tarpon Federal 44 19-2TFH, and Tarpon Federal 44-19TFHU. The well pad would be located in the SESE Section 19, T.153N., R.96W., 5th PM, McKenzie County, North Dakota (see attached map). The well pad surface area would be 440 feet by 380 feet in size with total disturbance being approximately 4.9 acres. Beginning at the Tarpon Federal 24~20 well site, the proposed access continues westerly along NFSR #881-3 through Section 20 and into the 813% of Section 19. Total length of the access road is approximately 2,854 feet. Utilities, which could include underground electric, ﬁber optic, oil, saltwater, freshwater, and natural gas lines, would parallel the proposed access road. Total disturbance for new construction, including the well pad, access, and utilities, would be approximately 11.4 acres. <br/>The proposed Newﬁeld Helsingborg Federal 153-96-22-27 well pad would include three wells: the Helsingborg Federal 153-96-22-27-2H, Helsingborg Federal 153-96-22-27-3H, and Helsingborg Federal 153-96-22-27-10H. The well pad would be located in the SWSW Section 15, T.153N., R.96W., 5lh PM, McKenzie County, North Dakota (see attached map). The pad </p>

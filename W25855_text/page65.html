After getting to bottom, the gas was circulated out, yielding a trip gas of 2,481 units. Drilling was then resumed. <br/>Slides and surveys continued to take longer. The inclination was increased to above 90 degrees, to slowly climb in section. While trying to take a survey at a hole depth of 20,123 ft, the MWD stopped working, and would not take a survey. This caused the need to trip out of the hole and replace it at a measured depth of 20,123ft. The MWD was replaced and tripped in the hole. After getting to bottom, the gas was circulated out, yielding a trip gas of 3,734 units. Drilling was then resumed after taking the missing surveys. The inclination was increased above the formational dip. This allowed the well path to climb in section. While doing so, the samples increased in grain size and oil shows. Aﬁer sliding at a measured depth of 20,791 ft, the ROP decreased while rotating to less than 20ft per hour. The decision was then made to trip out of the hole at 20,795ft. Upon getting out of the hole, it was obvious that the bit was severely damaged. The bit and mudmotor were changed out, then tripped in the hole. After getting to bottom, the gas was circulated out. This yielded a trip gas of 4,240 units. While drilling ahead rotating with the new BHA, the inclination was building slightly while rotating, causing the need to slide down. The ROP was near IOOft/hr. The background gas was near 160 units. <br/>While climbing in section, the samples increased in grain size and the gamma decreased to near 65 API. While rotating, the inclination increased to as high as 91.5 degrees at a survey depth of 2 l ,109ft. A downward slide at 21,178ft, decreased the inclination to 88.37 degrees. This caused the need to slide up, to increase the inclination. While decreasing in section, the gamma increased from near 60, to near 120 API. With the gamma change, the samples decreased in grain size. Going back thought the hotter gamma allowed a formational dip of 90.28 degrees to be calculated. The inclination was increased above formational dip to climb in section. While climbing in section, the cool gamma marker was seen in samples and gamma at a measured depth of 21,620ft. The inclination was building while rotating, causing the need to slide down often. Drilling continued to a measured depth of 22,245ﬁ. This was called total depth, due to hard line restrictions. Total depth for the lateral was reached at 4:00 am CT, December 1, 2014. </p>

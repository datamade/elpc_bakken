While drilling the curve, gamma and sample correlations were used to aid in landing within the Three Forks. The initial target TVD was for landing the curve was 1 1,005ft. While building the curve, the ROP was near lOOﬁ/hr. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale: 1 0, 94 I ft MD I 0,893 ft T VD -8, 93 7ft SS <br/>The Bakken Shale was drilled at a TVD of 10,893ﬁ. The shale was brownish black, with a slightly silty appearance. It was ﬁrm, slightly calcareous and subblocky to blocky. Occasional micro-pyrite was seen in the samples. The shale had spotty ﬂuorescence and a slow streaming cut. The penetration rate was less than 1 min/ft while in the shale. The background gas increased after ﬁrst getting into the shale to as high as 222 units, then gradually decreased to near <br/>200 units. </p>

MD 10,911ft TVD -8, 955ft SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was ﬁrst encountered in samples at a TVD of 10,91 lit. The samples were composed of Siltstone. It was medium gray to tan in color. It was moderately argillaceous, calcareous to limey in part, and had poor induration. The Siltstone had poor porosity, and interbedded dolomite. The dolomite was micro to very ﬁne grained, and limey and sucrosic in part. The samples had spotty dull yellow ﬂuorescence, and fast cloudy cuts. Background gas while drilling in the Middle Bakken Siltstone was near 250 units. <br/>Lower Bakken Shale: 11,045ft MD 10,955ft T VD -8,999ft SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale was drilled at a TVD of 10,955ft. The shale was brownish black, with a slightly silty appearance. It was firm, slightly calcareous and subblocky to blocky. Occasional micro-pyrite was seen in the samples. The shale had spotty ﬂuorescence and a slow streaming cut. The penetration rate was less than 1 min/ft while in the shale. The background gas increased while in the shale to as high as 734 units, then deceased to near 500 units. </p>

The samples were composed of medium cream gray, to medium tan, siltstone. It had moderate induration, with dolomitic to slightly calcareous cementation. The siltstone was slightly argillaceous, and graded to very ﬁne grained sandstone in part. The samples also had minor blue gray green shale. The shale was slightly calcareous, gritty to smooth in part, and had minor micro pyrite. The samples showed scattered light yellow ﬂuorescence, and moderate cloudy cuts. The background gas while drilling in the lateral was near 450 units. Drilling within the Three Forks continued to a measure depth of l 1,240ft. This was called TD of the curve at 9:52 PM CT October 18, 2014. </p>

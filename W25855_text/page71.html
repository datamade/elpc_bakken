It was located in SW SW Section 1 T152N R99W, McKenzie County, North Dakota. <br/>The Skarston 1-12 #3TF H was spudded on September 19, 2014. Well site geological services consisted of two person mud-logging unit from 9,200ft in the Charles Formation until, the end of the well. A Geospect was used for gas detection. Two sets of lagged samples in thirty, ﬁfty, and one hundred foot intervals were caught and saved to be archived. </p>

The vertical well was drilled using 5” drill pipe and collars. <br/>Base of Last Salt: 9,332]? MD 9,322]? T VD -7,43 0ft SS <br/>The last major salt bed was encountered at a depth of 9,322ft TVD. This was chosen primarily from gamma markers and an increase in penetration rates. The samples showed only a trace of salt after washing them. <br/>Ratcliﬁe: 9,396ft MD 9,386ft TVD 4,423]: ss <br/>The Ratcliffe was encountered at a TVD of 9,386ft. The formation was chosen primarily with the use of gamma. The limestone was medium to dark gray in color and was argillaceous to <br/>carbonaceous in part, and had poor to moderate induration, and poor to no visible porosity. The ROP was near 80ft/hr. </p>

The formation was composed of limestone. The limestone was light to medium gray brown, to light cream in color. The limestone grain size was wackestone to packestone, and had moderate induration. Samples had minor amounts of anhydrite. The samples showed poor to no porosity, dull ﬂuorescence, and weak cloudy cuts. <br/>Lodgepole: 10,111ft MD 10,101ft T VD -8,I45ft SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation was drilled at a TVD of 10,101ft, and was composed of medium to dark gray limestone. It had a wackestone grain size, and was argillaceous to carbonaceous in part, with poor to moderate induration. The intergranular porosity was poor to <br/>none visible. Most samples showed dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a weak cloudy cut. The background gas was near 25 units. </p>

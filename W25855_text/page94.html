The casing shoe was drilled out with a PDC bit and directional tools. Upon drilling out into open formation, the background gas was near 50 units. The curve was landed with an inclination near 87 degrees. While drilling out laterally, the decision was made to slowly decrease in section to get a full pass of the gamma section. While drilling ahead, slides for azimuth were used to turn the well path from 214 to 180 degrees. The ROP was near 55ﬁ/hr while rotating. The decision was made to trip out of the hole at 11,497ft to change out the mudmotor and bit due to slow ROP. Drilling ahead in the lateral continued with the new BHA. With the new assembly, the ROP increased to near 150ft/hr. The background gas increased to as high as 308 units at a measured depth of l 1,843ft. <br/>While drilling ahead in the lateral, the inclination decreased to as low as 87.75 degrees at a survey depth of 12,576ft. This caused the need to slide upward to level off the inclination. The ROP was near lSOﬁ/hr while rotating. The turn for azimuth was ﬁnished after a measured depth of 12,890ﬁ. The inclination increased to above 90 degrees. While climbing in section, the cool gamma marker was seen at a measured depth of 13,3 00ft. The samples increased in sandstone while in the cooler gamma. An overall dip of 89.78 degrees was calculated. The ROP started to decrease near 14,200ft. The ROP decreased to near 90 ft/hr. The ROP decreased to near 70ﬁ/hr. The ROP continued to decrease. The decision was made to trip out of the hole at a measured depth of 14,779ft. The bit, mudmotor, and MWD were changed out, then tripped in the hole. <br/>The inclination was slowly building while rotating. This caused the need to slide down only once every few hundred feet. After sliding down at a measured depth of 16,045ft, the inclination started to decrease. It decreased to as low as 87.9 degrees at a survey depth of 16,551ﬁ. The gamma increased to as high as 140 API near a measured depth of 16,600ft. <br/>After sliding down at a measured depth of 17,414ft, the inclination started to decrease while rotating. The inclination decreased to as low as 86.98 degrees at a survey depth of 17,606ft. Several slides were used to increase the inclination to near 90 degrees. After leveling off, the inclination stayed slightly above 90 degrees, and then would decrease to slightly less than 90, then build back up. This allowed for nearly 1,000 feet to be drilled without sliding. The inclination build to 90.7 degrees at a survey depth of 18,926ft. This caused the need for a downward slide to decrease the inclination. The inclination started to decrease while rotating after a measured depth of 19,200ft. This caused the need to slide up at a measured depth of 19,3 50ft. Slides were taking longer to complete, and then gamma tool stopped working properly. It would stop working while drilling, then start up after taking a survey. The footage drilled would then be re-logged with the gamma tool working. At a measured depth of 19,696ft, the gamma tool stopped working and could not be restaited. The decision was then made to trip out of the hole. During that trip out of the hole, the bit, mudmotor, and MWD were changed out, then tripped in the hole. Aﬁer tripping in the hole, the gas was then circulated out. This yielded a trip gas of 3,131 units, and a 10ft ﬂare. The last 180ﬂ of hole was re-logged with the new MWD to collect missing gamma, and to compare the difference in the API counts. After drilling resumed, an upward slide was attempted. It was very difficult to slide, so 45ft was then rotated and another slide was attempted without successes. While trying to slide, the drill string backed out and 70k of string weight was lost. It was easily screwed back into and the weight was regained. The decision was then made to trip out of the hole to pick up a shock sub and agitator and check the torque of the pipe threads. After tn‘pping out of the hole to 3,500ft of pipe left, a </p>

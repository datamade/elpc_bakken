(CLR) requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. CLR intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. Casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the APD NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drliling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Sect. 43-02-03-55 of NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an Initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. CLR understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding conﬁdentiality pertaining to this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced Immediately after construction If the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC <br/>43-02-03-19 8- 19.1). CLR will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rlg within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig. <br/>VA 7 v .1 a! 70‘7340 WITH SPUO .' ompany Telephone Number Continentai Resources, Inc. <br/>Address Oklahoma Cl OK 73126 , ,,,, w I ” <br/>     <br/>           <br/>FOR STATE USE ONLY <br/>Signatur Printed Name .I‘II-.. ~ .Ter L.Olson <br/>V 1 t Re ula - , Compliance 3 ecialist Au - ust 20, 2014 Email Address <br/>  <br/>1/7 <br/>Ti“ENGINEERING TECHNI ‘ ‘ <br/>       <br/>  </p>

The top of the CRETACEOUS-NEWCASTLE Formation within the Dakota Group is picked from logs at 5230 feet. The North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-21 requires that sufﬁcient cement be used to isolate the Dakota Group of which the CRETACEOUS-NEWCASTLE Formation is a part. In lieu of an immediate cement squeeze, approval may be granted (via Form 4 Sundry Notice) to monitor the surface-production <br/>casing annulus. Approval will be contingent upon the following stipulations: <br/>1. The surface-production casing annulus must be continuously monitored with an accurate pressure gauge, the pressure gauge must not be any higher than a 300 psi gauge. <br/>2. All valves installed on the annulus must be exposed to the surface; burial will be allowed only in the presence of an Oil and Gas Division inspector. <br/>3. Any pressure development on the annulus must be immediately reported to the Oil and Gas Division <br/>4. The CRETACEOUS—NEWCASTLE Formation must be isolated, as directed by the Oil and Gas Division, upon the abandonment of the well, remedial action may be required prior to <br/>abandonment if warranted by the Director. <br/>Since the Dakota Group is not properly isolated, CONTINENTAL RESOURCES must run a frac string prior to performing a Hydraulic Fracture Simulation per North Dakota Administrative Code <br/>Section 43-02-03-27.1 <br/>If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me. <br/>Sincerely, <br/>ichard A. Suggs <br/>Geologist jlg/ras <br/>600 E Boulevard Ave - Dept 405, Bismarck, North Dakota 58505-0840 Phone (701)328-8020 Fax (701)328-8022 </p>

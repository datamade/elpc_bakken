    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Operation <br/>On 9/30/14 we began building the curve from a KOP of 10355’. Attaining insuﬁicient build rates, we tripped at 10758’ to replace the bit and motor, exchanging the PDC bit for a tri—cone. <br/>The curve was completed on 10/2/14, at a measured depth of 11043’. The casing was set at 11013’ MD, approximately 18.5’ down from the Middle Bakken Top. <br/>We commenced the lateral on 10/ 5/ 14, experiencing immediate gamma failure. <br/>Drilling to 11053’, we conducted the F. I. T., then drilled to 11095 ’, attempting unsuccessfully to render the gamma tool operational. <br/>We tripped back to 10285’ and wirelined the gamma tool, then tripped in and resumed drilling. <br/>At 13540’ we halted drilling and circulated a bottom up sample, determining that we entered the Upper Bakken Shale at 135 32’. Tripping back to 13270’, we troughed and sidetracked, drilling ahead to TD without further incident. <br/>Lithologically, the Middle Bakken consisted of siltstone. The rock was off—white to cream, light to medium brown, and light to medium gray in color. The siltstone was dolomitic, and showed tight to poor intergranular porosity. <br/>Gas shows were fair. Total gas values averaged 500 units with the Gasbuster on. No ﬂare was produced. <br/>Cuts were predominantly ﬂash blue-white cuts. No oil shows were present after trips or while drilling ahead. <br/>Structurally, the Middle Bakken ran level, then dipped down. The formation dropped 15’ over the course of the well bore. The average inclination of the formation was 89.8 degrees. <br/>We TD’d the well on 10/9/14, with a total depth drilled of 15350’. 4337’ of hole was drilled beyond the casing. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Objective & Planning <br/>The objective of the Tracey 1~34H well was to drill a Middle Bakken horizontal well in the Williston Prospect. The well bore would be drilled southward, traversing one geographical section in T15 5N w R1 00W: Section 34. The Middle Bakken Member was 38’ thick at location. <br/>Lithologicaily, the Middle Bakken was expected to consist of dolomitic siltstone. <br/>Structurally, the formation was expected to dip down, dropping 15’ over the course of the well bore, with an average inclination of 89.8 degrees. </p>

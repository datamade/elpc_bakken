Gas Plant-Stateilne Plant 2b., 2c. See attachments <br/>Gathering Segment Name: Crosby Cgmgrgssor <br/>3a. Maximum Current Capacity of Gathering Segment: 30 MMCFD <br/>3b. Current Throughput of Gathering Segment: 16.5 MMCFD <br/>3c. Anticipated Capacity of Gathering Segment at W Date: 30 MMCFD <br/>3d. Anticipated Throughput of Gathering Segment at IP Date: 27 MMCFD <br/>3e. issues or Expansion Plans: There are plans for a South Crosby station that will provide 15 <br/>MMCFD of capacity to the South/SouthWest of this area. (Completion date TBD) Flowback Strategy <br/>43. First production is expected 1/1/16; Gas sales connection is expected on or before 12/17/15 4b. Anticipated oil and gas rates: W 726 BOPD, 822 MCFD <br/>Amount of Gas Applicant is Currently Flaring 5a. Statewide percentage of gas ï¬‚ared: 11.75% (11/2014) 5b. Fieldwide percentage of gas flared: Kimberly, 100% (ll/2014) <br/>Alternatives to Flaring <br/>6a. Purchaser capacity is expected to be sufficient for the volumes produced from these wells. in the event that electric power is required on-site, a natural gas powered generator will be evaluated. lnstallation of a liquid stripping plant to be utilized in the event of upset conditions would not be economic. Such an installation will be re-evaluated as additional wells are completed and if conditions change. <br/>6b. A natural gas powered generator could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 30-40 MCFD. A liquid stripping plant could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 40%. On lease gas use by Heater/Treaters will consume approximately 15 MCFD </p>

Rate of penetration ranged from 0.23 to 2.97 minutes per foot and averaged 0.66 minutes per foot. Samples transitioned from tan to tan gray limestone approximately 150’ into the Mission Canyon. The lower 200’ of the Mission Canyon consisted of tan gray to cream gray dolomite. Porosity throughout the Mission canyon ranged from generally good in the limestone to poor in the lower formation. Total gas ranged from 56 to 477 units and averaged 168 units. <br/>Lodgepole 9,468’ MD 9,454 ’ T VD - 7,162 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Lodgepole was picked using gamma markers found on offset logs. Drill rates in the Lodgepole to kick off point ranged from 0.43 to 1.33 minutes per foot and averaged 1.02 minutes per foot. Samples in the upper Lodgepole were generally tan gray limestone with overall poor porosity. Total gas ranged from 62 to 264 units and <br/>averaged 136 units. Kick off point of 9,805’ was reached at 12:30 am on September18, 2014. </p>

The landing target was to be 11’ into the Three Forks formation, initially set at 10,188’ TVD. Trip gas at kick off point peaked at 185 units. Drilling rates in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged from 0.43 to 2.50 minutes per foot and averaged 0.75 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 56 to 236 units and averaged 142 units. Samples in the lower Lodgepole were majority light to medium gray limestone with overall poor to fair porosity. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the curve to correlate to the Solberg 41-2H and 31-2TFH wells, which are located on the same pad. </p>

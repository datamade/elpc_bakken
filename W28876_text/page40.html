The contact point of the top of the clean gamma is used for the set line to determine the target. The set line is 4’ above the base of the target window, which will be clean gamma and the top 6’ of the window will be the dirtier gamma which is ratty throughout. The lateral began with the wellbore at the top of the target window. Formation was expected to updip slightly while making the azimuth turn, then begin to drop aﬁer an azimuth of 180 was achieved. Overall formation dip was expected to be 89.7 degrees. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">After drilling out intermediate casing the wellbore was allowed to drop in true vertical depth in order to enter the target window. After the wellbore encountered the base of the target window, sliding brought the inclination closer to 90 degrees in hopes of leveling off in the target window. At this time the azimuth turn was still being made, requiring a higher than average slide to rotate ratio. At 10,943’ measured depth a trip was made due to a suspected torqued scribe line. By that time the inclination had reached 94 degrees. The wellbore reached to about 2 feet below the lower Bakken shale before being turned down. No black shale was seen in samples. In the interval ﬁ’om 10,488’ to 10,943’ the rate of penetration ranged from 0.17 to 2.97 minutes per foot and averaged 0.81 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 22 to 528 units and averaged 213 units. Trip gas at 10,943’ reached 1252 units. Gamma ranged from 50 to 153 API and averaged 82 API. Samples from the clean gamma of the lower target window were generally sandstone: cram tan, cream, off white, ﬁne, subangular to subrounded, well sorted, dolomitic cement; 5% shale, light green, oﬁ‘white, pyritic, ﬁssile; rare pyrite; fair porosity; scattered brown oil staining, scattered green pinpoint ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy green faint streaming cut. While drilling above the target window samples were described as sandstone: translucent, tan, cream, oﬁ‘ white, ﬁne to very ﬁne, subrounded, moderately to well sorted, dolomitic cement; 20% shale, light blue green, light gray, pyritic, ﬁssile; 10% siltstone, light gray, laminated, platy; 1% pyrite; fair porosity; scattered brown oil staining, scattered pinpoint dull green ﬂuorescence, cloudy green faint streaming cut. <br/>After picking up a new motor and bit, sliding succeeded in bringing the wellbore lower in true vertical depth in order to reencounter the target window. The wellbore drilled under the 4’ set line until 12,480’, at which point gamma indicates the top of the Three Forks Aquitard was encountered. Sliding quickly brought the wellbore higher in true vertical depth and out of the Aquitard. The wellbore continued to drill under the set line until 14,300’. In the interval from 10,943’ to 14,27 8’ the rate of penetration ranged from 0.20 to 4.73 minutes per foot and averaged 0.50 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 17 to 1538 units and averaged 271 units. Gamma ranged from 42 to 161 API and averaged 82 API. The azimuth turn was completed at 13,000’ measured depth. Sample from the upper Aquitard were described as sandstone: light gray, gray cream, pyrite, very ﬁne grain, moderately to well sorted, subangular, dolomitic cement; 30% light gray blue shale, light gray, platy, pyritic, thin dark laminations; siltstone throughout, light gray; fair to poor porosity, no visible ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy white cut. Most samples between the base of the window and the top of the Aquitard were described as sandstone: light tan, cream, off white, translucent, cream gray, subangular, very ﬁne, moderately sorted, poorly to moderately cemented, dolomitic cement; scattered light gray siltstone; scattered </p>

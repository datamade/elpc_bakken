Conclusion <br/>The Wisness 150-100-23-14-12TFH well reached a total measured depth of 20,932feet. The curve was executed 1’ TVD within the planned target. Throughout the entire Lateral, gas averaged 35 units with values as high as 443 units. The wellbore was in the planned target zone for the majority of the well and the Geo-steering plan was carried out according to local calculated formation dip angles. The casing point was landed 5’ TVD into the Three Forks Formation. The Lateral was drilled mainly 17-25’ TVD into the Three Forks formation. The Wisness 150-100-23-14-12TFH well was drilled in 15.9 days. </p>

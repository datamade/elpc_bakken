This top was picked from lithology, gamma, and ROP changes. The Lower Bakken Dolomite exhibited cuttings that were dark gray to medium gray, dark cream, dark gray staining in part, soft to gummy, microcrystalline, sub-rounded to sub-angular, carbonaceous, slightly argillaceous, calcareous, moderate intimation, good to moderate intercrystalline porosity, scattered dull yellow green ﬂuorescence, with a slow light cloudy cut. <br/>Three Forks 11,436'MD 11,150’ TVD -8,831'SS </p>

This formation was picked from lithology, gamma, and ROP changes. The Three Forks produced a Dolostone /Limestone/ Sandstone that was greenish gray, tea], light blue, cream, trace dark gray laminations, anhydritic with interbedding anhydrite, blocky, argillaceous, slightly calcareous, slightly carbonaceous, dolomitic, chalky to fair induration, chalky to <br/>fair intercrystalline porosity, yellow to dull green ﬂuorescence, with a delayed thin streaming cut. <br/>Horizontal 11,510’ — 20,932’ MD <br/>The Horizontal section was started using brine water, in the Three Forks Formation at 8:20 AM CDT on December 11th, 2014. Drilling times ranged from 0.1 to 12.2 min/ft. Gas averaged 35 units with values as high as 443 units. Gamma was monitored and correlated to calculate formation dips throughout the Lateral. <br/>The ﬁrst section of the Lateral experienced a formation dip of 89.5 to 89.68 degrees. The well bore was drilled just above the “Top Window” marker for the majority of this section. In this section we were able to come down in zone and see gamma from <br/>our entire drilling window TVD. This provided a base line gamma signature to gee-steer the remainder of the Lateral. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">In the second section of the Lateral the wellbore tracked very well above the “Top Window” marker at a calculated formation dip of 89.58 degrees. At 16,000’ MD the well bore dropped below the marker and remained in between the “Top Window” marker and the “E” marker illustrated on the Well Tracker. At 16,832’ MD, the assembly was unable to slide for direction/inclination, so the decision was made to trip out of hole to pick up an agitator and shock sub. At 17,000’ MD, a hard streak that exhibited moderate amounts <br/>of pyrite was encountered. The lowest part of the well was encountered in this section at 17,450’ MD/11,221.74’ TVD. <br/>In the ﬁnal section of the Three Forks Lateral, the formation dip moderated from <br/>an 89.58 to an 89.78 degree dip. The well bore stayed above the “Top Window” marker for the majority of this section. Multiple hard streaks causing some extreme deﬂections were encountered in this section above and below the “Top Window” marker. These </p>

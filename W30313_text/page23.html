The pick of the Middle Bakken was primarily done oﬂ‘ gamma correlation to the Stenehjem 41-3H curve gamma. The lithology of the Middle Bakken Formation was siltstone that was pale to medium gray, light gray brown, and dark gray that was ﬁne grained. Rate of penetration was an average of 80 Mr. Gas was an average of 1332 units with a max of 2537 units through the Middle Bakken Formation. <br/>Casing point was reached @ 11,555' MD on January 16, 2015 at 7:00 AM CST in the Middle Bakken. Drilling ceased with a true vertical depth of 11,229.9 feet and measured depth of 11,555 feet, landing approximately 10 feet into the Middle Bakken Formation. </p>

According to the structure map, it was believed this well would average a 90.15 degree up dip - expecting formation to come up a total of approximately 25 feet throughout the lateral section. The Middle Bakken in this part of the Bully Field was expected to be 33 feet thick. A target window of 10 to 18 feet into the Middle Bakken Formation was set by Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation. Overall, formation trended down slightly throughout the well. In total, formation came down approximately 5 feet in total vertical depth. Mudloggers used B/C and CD facie contacts along with a clean gamma signature which was one to two feet above target window to correlate dip and determine structural position. <br/>The Stenehjem 41-3-3H lateral was completed in 5 runs using three Reed drill bits and one Security bit. The decision was made at 13914' MD to TOOH for MWD failure on January 19, 2015 at 8:00 PM CST. Drilling was resumed at 9:05 AM CST on January 20, 2015. The decision was made at 17,637' MD to TOOH for motor failure on January 21, 2015 at 2:00 PM CST. Drilling resumed at 7:15 AM CST on January 22, 2015. The decision was made at 18,809‘ MD to TOOH for MWD failure on January 22, 2015 at 5: 15 PM CST. Drilling resumed at 9:35 AM CST on January 23, 2015. The decision was made at 18,987' MD to TOOH for MWD failure on January 23, 2015 at 11:00 AM CST. Drilling resumed at 5:00 AM CST on January 24, 2015. <br/>The lithology of the Middle Bakken Formation was siltstone that was relatively medium to dark in color. The majority of the Stenehjem 41-3-3H lateral section was drilled nine to 19 feet into the Middle Bakken. Throughout the C facies gray, dark gray, and tan gray siltstone were the dominate colors found. As the wellbore trended up into the A facies, the dominate colors were slightly lighter in color and ranged from light gray to tan gray and cream gray. The footage spent out of the bottom of the target window; in the D facies, samples were mostly dark in color and dominantly brown and gray in color. Along with gamma interpretations, these subtle differences in color, as we transitioned through the zone, made it possible to distinguish structural position. </p>

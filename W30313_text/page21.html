The well was drilled by Pioneer 74 ﬂex rig. The well is located in the NENE quarter of section 3 T148N R99W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Stenehjem 41—3-3H was spudded on January 8, 2015 at 10:00 PM CST. The well reached a total depth of 20,776’ MD on January 25, 2015. Geological services began at 9,450’ MD in the Charles Formation on January 14, 2015 and continued to TD. Samples were caught by mudloggers throughout the well. <br/>All samples were washed, cataloged, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Society in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Total Gas LTD gas equipment was used to monitor gas throughout the well in correspondence with NOV RigSense EDR. <br/>Vertical 9,450’ —— 10, 710’ MD <br/>Logging began in the Charles Formation at a measured depth of 9,450 feet at 12:50 AM CST on January 14, 2015. Rate of penetration varied throughout the different rock types and formations but averaged 60 feet per hour throughout the vertical section. Gas averaged 66 units with a maximum reading of 196 units in the Mission Canyon Formation. The Pioneer 74 ﬂex rig reached kick off point at 1:40 AM CST on January 15,2015 at 10,710 feet. </p>

It was picked at the base of a slight heat up in gamma at 9,630 feet 1W). Samples also changed from salt that was clear and translucent to off white anhydrite. The lithology of the Base of Last Salt Formation was mainly light gray to gray limestone and off white anhydrite with spotted yellow white ﬂuorescence and weak slow cuts. Rate of penetration was an average of 64 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 53 units with a maximum of 140 units through the Base of Last Salt Formation. <br/>Mission Canyon 9, 855’ MD 9,853 ’ TVD -7,4 76 ’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,855 feet, 4 feet high to the prognosis.

The lithology of the Mission Canyon Formation was limestone <br/>that ranged in color from cream tan to gray to light gray and cream gray that produced a spotted ﬂuorescence and weak cuts. Rate of penetration was an average of 54 Mr. Gas <br/>was an average of 77 units with a max of 196 units through the Mission Canyon Formation, </p>

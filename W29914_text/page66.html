Oilbased drilling ﬂuid was used for the lateral due to the section of Open-hole with exposed shale at 11,292 - 11385’ MD. A Security MM64 was installed as bit number 7. The landing was made about 7 feet below the Upper Bakken Shale. Middle Bakken thickness was estimated at 28 feet. </p>

Upper target zone and above showed layered and inconsistent gamma levels from 7 5-100 counts. A consistent cool-gamma zone of 4070 API provided a marker at 10 feet below the Upper Bakken Shale. The top of the D <br/>facies at approximately 16 feet below the Upper Bakken showed the top of a tighter, more consistent zone with 85-95 API. <br/>Wherever cooler-gamma sections appeared, rate of penetration would slow down and be prone to deﬂections in inclination.

Samples in these areas also appeared to have less argillaceous content, and did not readily take tooling striations from the drillstn'ng. Cutting fragments tended to <br/>be larger. <br/>Upper and middle sections of the Middle Bakken showed a fairly calcareous, subarenaceous, partially translucent, medium to light gray, tan to beige and off white siltstone which frequently alternated between partially argillaceous ﬂakes and subarenaceous grains, to almost entirely silt- and very fine sand-sized grains. There appeared to be signiﬁcant bioturbation or other agitation in this zone. The lower section of the Middle Bakken, beginning about 16 feet below the Upper Bakken and extending to the Lower Bakken Shale, showed a fairly to moderately argillaceous, fairly to moderately ﬂaky, medium gray and tan fairly calcareous siltstone. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Formation dip began at a slight downdip of 89.9, and gradually rolled down into an 897 until 16,000’ MD. A 90.11 degree updip continued to 16,500’ MD, then steepened to 90.4 until 18,500’ MD. From 18,500’ MD to TD, the formation ﬂattened to <br/>90.0 degrees. <br/>Bit number 7 remained in the hole until 14,051 ’ MI), where a trip was made for degraded drilling performance. Bit number 8, another Security MM64 was used to 15,089’ MD, where a trip was made to install an agitator and shock sub in order to facilitate easier sliding. Bit eight was rerun on the new BHA. Another trip was made at 16065’ MD due to low rate of penetration. Bit number 9 was an HTC T406. Contact with the Lower Bakken Shale was made at 16,813’ MD. Shale was exited at 16,897 ’ MD with 84 feet of shale exposure. Continued drilling did not show signiﬁcant indication of the hole packing off with shale cavings. Another trip was made at 18,435’ MI) for MWD tools. Bit number ten was a Security MMDé4. Directional could not get to bottom while sliding at 18,808’ MD, and a trip was made for an inline reamer. Hole was reamed from 16,056’ MD, and TIH with pumps off through the shale exposure. Reran bit number 10 to 18,821’ MD and tripped out to drop the reamer, since directional could not get to bottom again. Tripped in with bit number 10 again, without the reamer, and drilled to 19,098’ MD. Difﬁculty sliding resulted in decision to sidetrack. </p>

    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The bit was pulled back to 15,891’ MD and time drilling began to build a sidetrack. The time dn'lling schedule can be found on the lateral sidetrack mudlog. Sidetrack was successﬁil on ﬁrst attempt. Drilling continued to 18,685’ MD, where a trip was made for MWD tools. Bit number 11 was a Security MMD54. Return to bottom showed an apparent gamma difference of ~35 API, which was attributed to the new gamma sensor. Normal drilling continued to 19,566’ MD, where MWD tools lost signal from the gamma sensor The directional sensor remained operational, so drilling continued without gamma until TD. TD was reached at 20,664’ MD on February 10‘”. <br/>Rate of penetration averaged 0.71 feet per hour, using four bits on nine bottom— hole assemblies to complete the lateral. Average background gas readings were 868 units. </p>

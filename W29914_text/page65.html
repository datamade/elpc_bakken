The Curtis Moen is a two-section lateral well which targets the Middle Bakken Formation. The Curtis Moen spudded January 15‘”, 2015 and reached a total depth of 20,664' MD on January 5‘“, 2015. Wellsite geological services began at 9,300 feet in the Base Last Salt at 10:00 AM January 18‘”, 2015. Thirty foot samples were collected in the vertical phase, and ﬁfty foot samples were collected in the lateral. </p>

Drill rates averaged .54 minutes per foot through the logged portion of the vertical phase of the well. <br/>Surface was drilled with a Security MMé6. The downhole bit at logging depth was a Security MM65D on the third bottom-hole assembly. This bit was run until kickoff point at 10,612’ MD. <br/>Mission Canyon 9, 763 ' MD 9, 75 7 ' TVD - 7,434 ’ SS Mission Canyon Formation consisted of medium tan, light to medium brown limestone throughout the entire zone. A maximum gas of 376 units was seen in the <br/>Mission Canyon, with a steady background gas averaging 139 units.

This contact point was used to estimate the dip to be 89.2 degrees. Drilling continued in the top two feet of the target window until 16,220’ measured depth. The interval of 14,825’ to 16,220’ the rate of penetration ranged from 0.08 to 3.87 minutes per foot and averaged 0.62 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 135 to 292 units and averaged 179 units. Gamma averaged 93 API. Samples were a light tan sandstone with fair porosity and a milky yellow green streaming cut. <br/>At 16,220’ measured depth, the wellbore encountered the clean gamma located at the set line. This contact point was used to estimate the dip to be 90.11 degrees. At 16,707’ measured depth, the gamma started to warm up and spiked to 120 API. This was discussed and thought to be the top of the target window. The dip was changed to 89.43 which correlated the Kaldahl 24—12H well just west of this pad. <br/>The gamma continued to get hotter and spiked to 181 API. This correlated with the Aquitard and the dip was changed to 9046 degrees. The wellbore was in the Aquitard from 17,348’ to 18,085’ measured depth. Orange shale was not seen in the samples. Gamma ranged from 82 to 181 API and averaged 132 API. The samples were generally described as sandstone: cream, light tan, off white, very ﬁne grain, subrounded to subangular, moderately to poorly sorted, dolomitic cement; 15% shale, off white, light blue green, light gray, pyritic, ﬁssile; 20% siltstone, light gray, laminated, platy; rare pyrite; fair to poor porosity; scattered dull green ﬂuorescence, weak white yellow cut. Drilling rates ranged from 0.20 to 3.5 minutes per foot and averaged 0.56 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 135 to 455 units and averaged 244 units. </p>

Replaced the bit, motor, and MWD tool. Once back on bottom trip gas spiked to 455 units. The wellbore crossed the base of the target window at 18,113’ measured depth. The clean gamma was encountered. The wellbore continued to rise in true vertical depth and the set line was crossed indicated by the hot gamma contact line. This contact point at 18,293’ measured depth was used to estimate the dip to be 90 degrees. <br/>The wellbore continued to drill in the hot ratty gamma seen in the upper target zone until 20,566’ measured depth. Here the set line was crossed and the clean gamma was encountered. Between 18,293’ and 20,566’ the samples were generally described as cream tan sandstone with varying percentages of light blue shale and light gray siltstone with fair porosity. Gamma ranged from 57 to 133 AP] and averaged 100 AP]. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.13 to 4.9 minutes per foot and averaged 0.43 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 140 to 629 units and averaged 336 units. <br/>The wellbore continued to drill in the clean gamma until 21,160’ measured depth. Here the hot gamma seen at the Aquitard was encountered and spiked to 148 API. The </p>

The Mission Canyon came in 8’ high to prognosis. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.47 to 3.2 minutes per foot and averaged 0.92 minutes per foot. Samples from the upper Mission Canyon were majority light gray limestone. Samples transitioned to gray brown dolomitic limestone in the last half of the Mission Canyon. Average porosity through the Mission Canyon was fair. Minimum oil shows throughout the Mission Canyon. Total gas ranged from 180 to 314 units and averaged 235 units. <br/>Lodgepole 9,429 ’ MD 9, 418’ T VD — 7,183 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Lodgepole was picked using gamma markers found on offset logs. The Lodgepole came in 14’ high to prognosis. Dn'll rates in the Lodgepole to kick off point ranged from 0.97 to 1.47 minutes per foot, and averaged 1.12 minutes per foot. Samples in the upper Lodgepole were generally tan gray limestone with overall poor porosity. Total gas ranged from 208 to 230 units and averaged 218 units. Kick off point of 9,450’ was reached at 9:40 pm on December 12, 2014. </p>

The landing target was to be 11’ into the Three Forks formation, initially set at 10,155’ TVD. No trip gas was recorded at kick off point. Drilling rates in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged ﬁom 0.26 to 6.23 minutes per foot, averaging 1.47 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 163 to 365 units, averaging 229 units. Samples in the lower Lodgepole were majority light gray to tan gray limestone with overall poor to fair porosity. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the curve to correlate to the Kaldahl 34-12H and G. Bergstrom 31-13TFH wells.

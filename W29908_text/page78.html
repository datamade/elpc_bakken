Rate of penetration ranged from 0.30 to 0.97 minutes per foot, averaging 0.52 minutes per foot. The upper Bakken was described as black carbonaceous shale with no visible porosity and a bright fast streaming cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 1 0,235 ’ MD 10, 062 ’ T VD - 7,82 7’ SS <br/>The top of the Middle Bakken was picked at a decrease in rate of penetration and gamma. The Middle Bakken came in 13’ high compared to the prognosis. The ﬁrst sample caught in the Middle Bakken was described as gray dolomite with fair to good porosity. Samples transitioned to a light gray sandstone with poor porosity and a cloudy green fair streaming cut. Rate of penetration in the Middle Bakken ranged from 0.43 to 1.47 minutes per foot, averaging 0.81 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 337 to 1066 units, averaging 520 units. Gamma ranged from 53 to 177 API, averaging 91 API. <br/>Lower Bakken 10,384 ’ MD 10,115’ T VD -7,880’ SS <br/>The top of the Lower Bakken Shale was picked at an increase in rate of penetration and gamma. The Lower Bakken came in 9’ high compared to the prognosis. Sample changed from sandstone to black shale. Gamma peaked at 848 API and averaged 649 API. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.20 to 0.87 minutes per foot and averaged 0.46 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 393 to 1459 units and averaged 842 units. <br/>Three Forks 10,476’ MD 10,143’ TVD -7,908’ SS <br/>The top of the Three Forks was picked at a decrease in rate of penetration and gamma, as well as a change in sample from black shale to light gray sandstone. Rate of penetration in the Three Forks while drilling the curve ranged from 0.23 to 1.07 minutes per foot and averaged 0.64 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 438 to 836 units and averaged 605 units. Gamma ranged from 70 to 150 API and averaged 99 API. Samples were light gray sandstone with overall fair to poor porosity. Samples had a good yellow green good streaming cut. Intermediate casing point was reached at 10,594’ measured depth on December 4, 2014 at 3:15pm. Projection to bit put the wellbore at the target TVD of 10,150’ TVD at 8950 degrees. <br/>Lateral 10,594’ - 21,340’ <br/>After intermediate 7” casing was successﬁilly ran and set to 10,569’ measured depth, drilling began in the lateral at 1:50am on January 2, 2015. No notable trip gas. The top of the 10’ target window is set 11’ below the base of the lower Bakken shale. There is a clean gamma contact at the 2’ set line. The set line is located 2’ below the top of the target zone. The gamma located at the top 2’ of the target window is hotter ratty gamma ranging between 63 to 127 API and average 104 API. At the base of the target zone there is a slightly warmer gamma bench which typically spikes to 86 API. <br/>Aﬁer drilling out intermediate casing the wellbore was determined to be at the top of the target window in the hot ratty gamma. The wellbore continued within the top 2’ of </p>

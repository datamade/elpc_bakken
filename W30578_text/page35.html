Gas ranged from 20 to 57 units with a 1,503 unit show coming from the Scallion. At 10,419’ MD KOP was reached and a trip was made to pick up curve assembly. This trip produced 54 units of trip gas. Drilling of the curve began at 2:15 am CT on March 6, 2015. The Lodgepole came in 5’ low to prognosis. </p>

Samples were shale, black, non-calcareous, carbonaceous, rough, ﬁssile in part, blocky to sub—blocky, no porosity, abundant dull green ﬂuorescence, immediate bright milky yellow cut. Gas ranged from 140 to 418 units The Lower Bakken shale came in 2’ low to prognosis. <br/>Three Forks 11, 023 ’ MD 1 0,863 ’ TVD -8, 590 ’ SS <br/>The Three Forks was picked from gamma change. Samples were dolomite, gray, brown, light brown, cream, tan, very silty, argillaceous at times, slightly calcareous, predominately microsucrosic, earthy at times, friable to ﬁrm, scattered pale greenish gray shale, scattered dark brown oil staining, poor intercrystalline porosity, scattered to abundant pale yellow green ﬂuorescence, with weak ﬂuorescing cuts. Gas ranged from 65 to 167 units with no connection coming through. The Three Forks came in with prognosis. The curve was drilled to 11,156’ MD on March 6, 2015. Casing was set at 11,138’ MD, 10,882.01’ TVD and 395.84’ VS. BHL of casing was 1,155.69’ FNL & 1,315.28’ FEL in Section 25 T150N R97W. </p>

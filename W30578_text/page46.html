The plan was to come down into target zone to see the gamma signature. The planned target was a 14’ window with the Internal 1 shale being the bottom. Emphasis was put on a 5’ window of higher gamma with two distinct gamma cool downs above and <br/>below. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Casing was exited at 10:45 pm CT on March 6, 2015. Angle out of casing was approximately 88° and the bit came down and entered target zone at 11,250’ MD. At 11,214’ MD a 280 azimuth turn began The bit was leveled off in target and the turn continued until 12,400’ MD. Drilling continued staying in the hot gamma until a dip change at 13,000’ MD. At this time the bit went into the bottom portion of target zone and scraped very slightly into the Internal 1 from 13,400 — 13,500’ MD. The bit was brought back up after seeing the hot gamma it was found that dip had changed again and was coming down fairly hard. Drilling continued with the bit in the hot gamma and occasional dips into the cleaner gamma below. This gave us good dip calculations and aided in steering. At approximately 19,150’ MD the bit took a hard bounce down and dropped severely with slides showing less than anticipated results. Aggressive slides up were put in and at 19,520’ MD the bit entered the Internal 1 before being leveled off. At 19,950’ MD the bit came back into target zone. At this point we were close to TD and the bit was rotated out to TD, building on rotation and showing a projection to bit at TD of 955°. TD of 20,355’ MD was reached at 1:05 am CT on March 16, 2015 and had a BHL of236.62' FSL & 1,003.68' FEL, Section 36 T150N R97W. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The lateral showed very low gas readings out of casing and throughout the well. At approximately 18,400’ MD a noticeable increase was seen This showed an increase in C3 and C4 chromats which typically indicates the presence of oil. However, there was also a high increase in C5 which indicates increased gas from lube sweeps. At the beginning of the increase there was a large increase in the frequency of lube sweeps. At 20,200’ MD the gas buster was brought online and there was no ﬂare seen so it appears that the majority of the gas increase was most likely from the lube sweeps. There were no oil shows observed through the lateral and water weights were maintained at 9.8 to 10 pounds. At 12,023’ MD a trip made due to an increase in pressure and over pull seen when picking up off of bottom. It was found that part of the casing shoe had been picked up and was lodged on to the bit. This trip produced 336 units of trip gas and no oil shows. Refer to Cross Section on page 19 to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. </p>

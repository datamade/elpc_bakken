    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">2 downslides were put in at 16,045’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. Drilling would continue in the upper portion of the target window until a drop in the wellbore was seen at 17,207’ MD. A high side slide was put in at 17,386’ MD to prevent the wellbore from dropping too quickly in the formation. This drop would send the wellbore through the low gamma marker at 17,280’ MD. This encounter would indicate <br/>a ﬂattening in the formation to 89.98 degrees. <br/>Drilling would continue in the upper portion of the target window until a downslide put in at 18,146’ MD as well as a deﬂection down would send the wellbore dropping quickly in the formation. 3 high side slides were put in at 18,348’ MD to level the wellbore off in the lower portion of the target window. <br/>A steepening in the formation dip was seen at this point to 89.8 degrees. Drilling would continue in the lower portion of the target window until 3 high side slides were put in at 19,456' MD to prevent the continued drop in the wellbore. <br/>These slides would send the wellbore rising in the formation. An encounter with the clean gamma marker at 19,640’ MD would indicate a further drop in the formation dip rate to 89.54 degrees. 2 downslides put in at 19,811’ MD would level the wellbore off for a short time until a deﬂection at 20,057’ MD would send it rising in the formation once again. <br/>A downslide was put in at 20,286’ MD to prevent the continued rise in the wellbore. The remainder of the lateral was drilled in rotation to the TD of 20,61 5’ MD reached at 2:45 AM CDT on February 8, 2015. <br/>The well is awaiting completion. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Lower Bakken Shale came in at 11,054’ MD, and 10,952’ TVD, this was 8’ low to the prognosis. The gamma reached 735.71 API at this point. Background gas averaged 448 units, peaking 1430 units. Samples in the Lower Bakken were black, carbonaceous blocky shale, with instant milky yellow cuts. <br/>THREE FORKS 11,123’MD 10,978’ TVD -8,978’SS <br/>The Three Forks formation came in at 11,123’ MD and 10,978’ TVD, this was 10’ low to the prognosis. Gamma readings dropped down to 68.77 API. Background gas averaged 171 units, peaking at 758 units. Samples in the Three Forks consisted mostly of pinkish tan dolomite along with bluish gray platy moderately carbonaceous shale. The curve was landed at a total depth of 11,240’ MD on Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 3:30 PM CST. 7" intermediate casing was set to 11,209’ MD. <br/>LATERAL <br/>The drilling of the lateral began on Sunday February 1, 2015 at 7:00 PM CDT. The casing shoe was set at 11,209’ MD. The wellbore would begin dropping in the formation following report time. 3 high side slides were put in starting at 11,338’ MD to counter this drop. These slides would send the wellbore rising in the formation, into the upper portion of the target window. A downslide was put in at 12,175’ MD to level the wellbore off. <br/>Drilling would continue in the upper portion of the target window between 2 hard streaks until a rise was seen at 13,605' MD. This rise would send the wellbore into the upper portion of the formation. 2 downslides were put in at 13,771 ’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. A 3rd downslide at 14,151 ’ MD was drilled to send the wellbore back into the target window. The wellbore would re-enter the target window at <br/>14,320’ MD. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">2 high side slides were put in at 14,436’ MD to level the wellbore off once again. A dip rate of 90.0 degrees was seen for this section. The wellbore would begin rising following these high side slides. A downslide was put in at 15,005’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. This slide would send the wellbore into the lower portion of the target window. <br/>An unexpected drop in the wellbore was seen at 15,598’ MD. This drop would send the wellbore into the lower portion of the formation. 2 high side slides were put in at 15,718' MD and 15,732’ MD to counter this drop and send the wellbore back up into the target window. The wellbore would re-enter the target window at 15,905’ MD. </p>

ROP in the Mission Canyon ranged from 0.30 to 1.30 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas measurements ranging from 26 to 54 units. Samples generally consisted of limestone, which were medium to light and dark gray, medium to light and dark brown, packstone to wackestone, moderately argillaceous, moderately carbonaceous, moderately well indurated, fair intergranular porosity, light to dark green and dark gray ﬂuorescence, with slow to fast streaming cuts. <br/>Lodgepole 8,570’ MD 8, 568’ TVD ~6, 664’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole formation top was picked at 8,570’ MD/-6,664’ SS, where samples changed from a light to medium brown and gray limestone to a medium to dark gray limestone. ROP in the Lodgepole ranged from 0.10 to 1330 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, with gas measurements ranging from 22 to 2,034 units. Samples generally consisted of limestone which were medium to dark and light gray, brown to light brown in part, argillaceous, wackestone, silty, slightly carbonaceous, moderately well indurated, fair to good intergranular porosity, light green to dark green/gray ﬂuorescence, with moderately fast streaming cuts. <br/>Curve Section 8,870’ — 9,553 ’ 1WD <br/>The curve section of Parshall 23—3029H began 300’ MD into the Lodgepole formation at a KOP of 8,870’ MD. Directional tools were picked up on October 25, 2014, and the curve was started at 1:25 PM CDT on October 25, 2014. Aﬁer experiencing poor build rates, performed round trip to surface at 9,303’ MD beginning at 11:00 PM CDT on October 25, 2014 to pick up insert bit, and resumed drilling with this bit at 8:30 AM CDT on October 26, 2014. Drilling rates in the curve ranged from 0.10 to 1330 minutes per foot while sliding and rotating, and gas measurements ranged from 22 to 2,034 units. Gamma markers were utilizal throughout the curve to correlate Parshall 23-3029H with Parshall 92-28H and four other oﬂ‘set wells. </p>

Aﬂer the E marker was encountered at 12,945’ MD a slide was put in to move out of the E marker and back into the target formation above the E marker. Aﬁer the ﬁrst slide was put in the inclination of the wellbore continued to drop and the F gamma marker was encountered at 13,060’ lvﬂ). This was conﬁrmed by samples containing dark red Siltstone. It was then decided to TOOH at 13156’ MD on November 23, 2014 at 5:00 PM MST due to a MWD failure. Drilling resumed at 9:45 AM MST on November 24, 2014. Slides were immediately put in to bring the wellbore inclination up and move back above the E and F gamma markers. The E marker was encountered again at 13665’ MD and the formation projection was recalculated to 90.12 degrees. At 14,248’ MD Dip was changed to 90.63 degrees while bit tracked from the in and out of the E gamma marker and up to the top of the target window. For the 1,000’ of the three forks lateral the lateral drilled between the top of the target window and the E gamma marker, recalculating the formation dip to 90.54 degrees at 14,868’ MD and to 90.30 degrees 15,453’ MD. At 15,923’ MD the E marker was encountered again and the formation projection was recalculated to 89.91 degrees. It was decided to TOOH at 16,005‘ MD to change out BHA on 11/26/14 at 5:30 PM MST. Drilling resumed at <br/>4: 15PM MST on 11/27/ 14. The formation stayed at 89.91 degrees until the well bore encountered the E marker at 16,664’ MD and moving back above the E marker at 17,746’ MD recalculating the formation projection to 90.30 degrees. It was decided to TOOH at 17,231' MD due to an MWD failure on 11/28/ 14 at 3 :30 PM MST. Resumed drilling at 11:30am MST on 11/29/ 14. Drilling continued along the projected target of 90.3 degrees for the next 2000’ MD when the E marker was encountered again at 19,453’ MI) and it was recalculated to 90.22 degrees. It was decided to TOOH at 17,856' MD to change the Bit on 11/29/14 at 11:30 AM MST. Resumed drilling at 5:30 AM MST on 12/1/14. Drilling stayed just above the E marker for about 500’ and then dropped below the E marker at 19,828’ MD. Drilling continued in the E marker and slides were used to raise the wellbore out of the E marker. The wellbore moved out of the E marker at 20,360’ MD and the formation projection for the remainder of the Three Forks lateral was recalculated to 90.35 degrees. The Simpson 151~102—5-8-10TFH Lateral reached a total depth of 20,786’ MD on December 3, 2014 at 10:45 AM MST. Drilling rates in the Three Forks formation ranged from 003—190 minutes per foot with an average of 0.65 minutes per foot. The bottom hole location was projected at MD 20786 / INC 90.00 / AZ 179.50 / TVD 10910.66/VS 10125.44. <br/>GAMMA <br/>Gamma readings throughout Lateral were consistent in magnitude and range compared to the readings encountered during the curve. Gamma readings in the Middle Bakken formation ranged between 32 and 141 API and averaged 89 API during the lateral. The target zone of 11’-20’ below the bottom of the base of the Lower Bakken Shale </p>

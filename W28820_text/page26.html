Survey interval may be decreased as needed to steer wellbore but will not be increased above the len ths listed above —m_ Trile Combo Base of surface casin to KOP. GR to surface Cement Bond Lo ' On intermediate casin; <br/>TD to Surface MWD — GR Throu h Curve and Lateral <br/>The anticipated completion program is as follows: <br/>                 <br/>  <br/>      <br/>                  <br/>      <br/>             <br/>- After drilling the Bakken lateral, a 4-1/2” production liner with multiple packers will be run ﬁ‘om above KOP, inside the 7” intermediate casing, out to TD of the lateral. Lateral stimulation will consist of multiple frac stages, consisting of a slick water or hybrid system with proppant. All ﬁ‘ac stages will be pumped down a “tie-back” string of 4-1/2” casing of similar or stronger weight and grade to that of the liner. The tie back string will be run from surface to the top of the production liner and will provide pressure isolation during fracture stimulation. <br/>Abnormal Pressures and H28 Gas <br/>No abnormal pressures or temperatures or other hazards are anticipated. HZS gas is not expected to be encountered in this wellbore, but precautions will be taken to monitor for the presence of HZS while drilling. </p>

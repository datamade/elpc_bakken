This plug was pumped ahead of the preflush and slurry, and when it hit the float collar pumping pressure reached maximum and pumping stopped. A total of 20 bbls diesel, 20 bbls spacer, 10 bbls of 10 ppg scavenger, 147 bbls of lead slurry and 156 bbls of tail slurry were contained inside the 7” casing. The casing packoff was set and pressure tested to 5,000 psi for 10 mins. After WOC to allow the cement to harden sufficiently the cement was drilled out. The plug and float collar were drilled out. Drilled through float shoe @ 11,221’ and washed 5’ past shoe to 11,226’ (verbal approval to drill out FS received from Allen Christensen). Circulated one bottoms-up through the backside of 7” casing. TOOH & LD DP. Could not retrieve pack off. MU casing packoffjoint and screwed into packoff. Set wireline bridge plug in 7" casing to test pack off and connection with landing joint. Pressure tested to 2,500 psi for 10 mins. — held OK. Retrieved BP. Pumped 20 bbls preflush, 20 bbls spacer, 10 bbls brine, 10 bbls scavenger @ 11 ppg, 145 bbls lead slurry @ 13.0 ppg and 160 bbls tail @ 15.6 ppg. Underdisplaced by 3.5 bbls, got preflush returns to surface. Left cement head on casing and shut in head. Initial pressure on head 1,800 psi, pressure stabilized at 1,725 psi. After 10 hrs WOC released trapped pressure and monitored pressure.

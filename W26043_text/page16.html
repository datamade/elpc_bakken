Hiland Partners’ Watford City Super System is a broad network of low pressure and high pressure lines. Field gas is gathered and transported through the system to Hiland Partners’ - Watford City Plant (Sec. 6—151N-102W) for processing. The system has interconnections to allow ofﬂoading excess gas volumes to Hess’ ‘l‘loga plant (Sec. 26-157N'95W) and to OneOK’s Stateline plant (Sec. 21—155N-103W). <br/>2b., 2c. See attached plats. <br/>Gathering Segment Name: WC4-4 Bears Gathering System <br/>  <br/>3a. ‘ Maximum Current Capacity of Gathering Segment: 55 000 MCFD <br/>3b. Current Throughput of Gathering Segment: 32,000 MCFD <br/>3c. Anticipated Capacity of Gathering Segment At IP Date: 55,000 MCFD <br/>3d. Anticipated Throughput of Gathering Segment At IP Date: 54,000 MCFD (including these wells} 39. Issues or Expansion Plans: N/A V <br/>Flowback Strategy <br/>43. First production is expected 4/3/15, Gas sales connection is expected by 3/18/ 15 <br/>4b. Anticipated oil and gas rates: IP 1,096 BOPD, 1,881 MCFD <br/>Amount of Gas Applicant is Currently Flaring Sa. Statewide percentage of gas ﬂared: 11.31% (5/2014) 5b. Fieldwide percentage of gas flared: Camp, 6.5% (5/2014) <br/>Alternatives to Flaring <br/>Ga. Purchaser capacity is expected to be sufficient for the volumes produced from these wells. In the event that electric power is required on—site, a natural gas powered generator will be evaluated. Installation of a liquid stripping plant to be utilized in the event of upset conditions would not be economic. Such an installation will be re-evaluated as additional wells are completed and if conditions change. <br/>6b. A natural gas powered generator could be expected to reduce ﬂare volumes by approximately 30—40 MCFD. A liquid stripping plant could be expected to reduce ﬂare volumes by approximately 40%. On lease gas use by Heater/Treaters will consume approximately 15 MCFD </p>

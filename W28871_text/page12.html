The Units can be combine? high volumes of gas.  o Hess has contracted with GTUIT to provide mobile gas treatment units (MTUsJ'; five GTUIT units being utilized in the field and expects delivery of three additici units have capacities ranging from 500 MSCFD to 1,000 MSCFD and can be re another. The units also can be linked onsite to provide a larger daily capacity I.; o Hess is developing methodologies that will result in an order-of-merit list of c" deploy the MTUs, based on environmental, regulatory, economic, and operate commercial constraints present which pertain to Hess's commercial agreemeri’ produce at least half of the MSCFD unit capacity and cover the initial connec the GTUIT unit to be economic. <br/>Bi-Fuel Rig Conversion: 0 Bi'Fuel Conversion is a process where diesel engines are converted to operat fuel and natural gas. V <br/>o Hess has partnered with Nabors Drilling to equip six "PACE B” rigs operating i Kits. GTi Altronics is a retrofit technology allowing diesel engines to operate on and diesel fuel. Boiler sheds will be converted to run on 100% natural gas dUl'If V I units have a gas requirement of 50%. The Bi-Fuel System required approximat? w boilers require approx. 100-150 MSCFD. V <br/>0 Hess is unable to utilize this technology on depleted wells lacking gas product intermittent gas supply is another issue related to Bi-Fuel usage. Safety is also requires aboveground gas lines. <br/>Natural Gas Generators: 0 Natural Gas Generators are an alternative to diesel generators to provide ele <br/>propane for use during hourly production fluctuation. Natural gas generators i} used when gas is not being produced from the well. As production of gas incr f the units may switch from propane to natural gas and then back to propane. 0 Hess performed two pilot programs to evaluate performance characteristics 0% from two manufacturers. Both manufacturers require further development to? performance of units. <br/>Bi-Fuel (Blended) Diesel Generators:  - Bi-Fuel diesel generators are diesel generators with natural gas "makeup" kit (3 <br/>use produced gas onsite to power the facility. <br/>0 Hess is currently in the conceptual phase of evaluation of Bi-Fuel Diesel Gener3 </p>

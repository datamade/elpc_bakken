This well is located on Section 32 T155N R93W, Mountrail County, North Dakota. The EN-Fretheim A-155-93-3334H-5 was spud on October 18, 2014. The well reached a total depth for the vertical hole and curve at 10,869’ MD, and 10,544.62.’ TVD on October 23, 2014. Total depth of the Middle Bakken lateral was reached at 21,853’ MD on November 18, 2014, after drilling the EN-Fretheim A H-S in its entirety on this multi-well pad. The bottom hole location is 1,770.98’ FNL & 296.33’ F EL, Section 34 T155N R93W. This well was drilled using an invert based mud system for the vertical /cu1ye, and saline rich salt water for the lateral. Jon Lindvig and Jason Scherer of Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided the wellsite geological services, beginning at 8,100’ MD in the Kibbey Formation and concluded in the Middle Bakken at a total depth of 21,853’ MD. Samples were caught at lagged depths of thirty feet in the vertical and curve and ninety feet in the lateral. They will saved to be archived at Hess Corporation in Houston, Texas and at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 8, 100 ’ — 10, 050 ’ MD <br/>Logging services began during drilling of the vertical portion of the well at 8,100” MD in the Kibbey Formation at 3 :58 AM CDT on October 20, 2014. Neset Total Gas was used for the gas monitoring program. During the vertical portion of the well, drill rates ranged from 0.3-5.9 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 39-488 units. The vertical portion of the well concluded at a kick off point of 10,050 feet measured depth on October 21, 2014 at 3:10 AM CDT. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Kibbey Lime was encountered at 8,182’ measured depth; -5,808’ sub-sea level. This was seven feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. The Kibbey Lime was chosen by a change in gamma data. While drilling through the Kibbey Lime samples consisted of limestone and sandstone. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Medium to light gray, tan, carbonaceous, soft to ﬁrm, moderately argillaceous; scattered sandstone, red orange, very ﬁne to ﬁne, well rounded to sub rounded, well sorted, fair intergranular porosity; even yellow ﬂuorescence, thin yellow cut. SANDSTONE: Red to red orange, orange, brown, very ﬁne to ﬁne grained, rounded to sub rounded, moderately sorted, moderately argillaceous; crystalline, soft to chalky, carbonaceous; Limestone, 30% light to medium gray, carbonaceous, slightly argillaceous, soft to ﬁrm; yellow mineral ﬂuorescence, thin yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.4-1.8 minutes per foot, and the gas averaged 68 units. <br/>Charles Salt 8,336’ MD 8,334’ TVD -5,962 ’ ss <br/>The Charles Salt was encountered at 8,334’ measured depth; -5,962’ sub-sea level; this was also seven feet low with respect to the prognosis. The Charles Salt was picked by change in rate of penetration, gamma data, and change in lithology, which changed from limestone and sandstone to halite and anhydrite. Samples consisted of halite, sandstone, anhydrite, and limestone. A typical sample was as follows; HALITE: Clear, off white, frosty to translucent, </p>

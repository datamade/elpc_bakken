A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: 80% Medium brown, light brown, tan, beige, brown gray, light to medium gray, soft to ﬁrm, chalky, microcrystalline, moderate to fair induration, poor porosity, calcareous, argillaceous, 20% DOLOMITE: light gray, trace anhydrite, cream to off white, fair yellow, even yellow-white mineral ﬂuorescence, cloudy yellow cut. DOLOMITE: 70% Gray brown, gray to dark gray, light brown, medium gray, soft to ﬁrm, chalky, microcrystalline, moderate to fair induration, poor porosity, moderately calcareous, slightly argillaceous, 30% interbedded limestone, gray cream gray, light gray, trace amount of anhydrite, creamy off white, even yellow ﬂuorescence, cloudy yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.4-2.9 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 45-488 units. The kick off point was <br/>chosen to be 10,050’ measured depth. </p>

The Lodgepole was picked from change in gamma data and drill rates. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Medium gray to gray, light brown, soft to ﬁrm, chalky, microcrystalline, moderate to good induration, poor porosity, highly calcareous, moderately argillaceous, dolomitic, light brown to tan, light gray, even yellow green ﬂuorescence, instant cloudy yellow cut. Drill rates in the Lodgepole ranged from 0.3—4.1 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 28-286 units. <br/>False Bakken 10,578’MD 10,484’ TVD -8,112’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was encountered at 10,484’ TVD; -8,1 12’ sub-sea level; this was eight feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. The False Bakken was picked from change in gamma data and drill rates. One sample was processed and was as follows; LIMESTONE: Medium to dark gray, light to medium tan, soft to ﬁrm, chalky, microcrystalline, moderate to good induration, poor porosity, calcareous, moderately argillaceous, dolomitic, light brown to brown, light gray, faint even yellow green ﬂuorescence, cloudy yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.4-2.6 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 95-3 54 units. <br/>Upper Bakken 10,607’ MD 10,497’ TVD -8,125’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was encountered at 10,497’ TVD; -8,125’ sub—sea level; this was eight feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. The Upper Bakken was picked by change in rate of penetration, gamma data and lithology identiﬁcation. A typical sample was as follows; SHALE: Black, very ﬁne grained, platy to blocky, ﬁrm non—calcareous, carbonaceous, ﬁssile, brittle, poor intergranular porosity, 10% Limestone, light to medium gray, microcrystalline, ﬁrm to brittle, highly argillaceous, dolomitic, poor intercrystalline porosity, spotty dull yellow ﬂuorescence, thick streaming bright yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.26.1 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 202-1,044 units. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,662 ’ MD 10,51 7’ TVD -8,I45 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at 10,517’ TVD; -8,l45’ sub-sea level; this was seven feet lower than expected respect to the prognosis.

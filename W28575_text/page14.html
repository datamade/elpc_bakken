This encounter was thirteen feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. The Top Base of Last Salt was picked by change in rate of penetration, gamma data, and lithology identiﬁcation. Samples consisted of halite. A typical sample was as follows; HALITE: Clear, frosty to translucent, ﬁrm, compacted, trace sandstone, light orange, red-orange, chalky, soft, 20% limestone, gray, light gray, brown, trace anhydrite, patchy dull yellow ﬂuorescence, weak streaming cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.3-0.5 minutes per foot, and the gas averaged 87 units. <br/>Base ofLast Salt 8,912’ MD 8,910 ’ TVD -6,538’ SS <br/>The Base of Last Salt was encountered at 8,912’ measured depth; -6,538’ sub—sea level; this was seven feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. The Last Salt was picked by change in rate of penetration, gamma data, and lithology identiﬁcation. Samples through the Base of Last Salt consisted of limestone with some interbedded anhydrite. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: 65% Cream gray, medium gray, gray tan, carbonaceous, soft to ﬁrm, slightly argillaceous, crystalline; 35% Anhydrite off white to translucent, blocky; poor to fair <br/>intergranular porosity; scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, slow thin yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.3-0.8 minutes per foot, and the gas averaged 99 units. </p>

Samples through the Ratcliffe consisted of limestone and dolomite. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: 75% Cream gray to light gray, medium gray, gray tan, carbonaceous, slightly argillaceous, soft to ﬁrm, crystalline, 25% Dolomite: light to medium gray, trace anhydrite, off white to white, soft to ﬁrm; scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, slow thin yellow cut. DOLOMITE: 80% Gray, brown gray, medium tan, medium gray, soft to ﬁrm, microcrystalline, moderate induration, poor porosity, calcareous, slightly argillaceous, 20% Limestone, gray, cream gray, light gray, trace anhydrite, cream to off white, dull even yellow ﬂuorescence, cloudy yellow cut.

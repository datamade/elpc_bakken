Marathon has contracted the above contractor to perform the pit reclamation. 1. Marathon cuttings pits are typically dried and stabilized with fly ash during drilling operations so there was no p'I-t water disposed of. However, if not, the following will be completed: A. Empty waste fluids and haul to approved SWD well B. Mix pit cuttings with fly ash to stabilize the cuttings. 2. The following will be done on all wells A. Cover the pit area with a minimum of four (4) feet of backfill that is stockpiled at the site. B. The backfilled surface will be sloped to promote surface drainage away from the reclaimed pit. C. Contour landscape to as close to original as possible at a later date - potential near term use of area. D. Spread stockpiled topsoil after backfill. The site will be seeded with a grass mix.

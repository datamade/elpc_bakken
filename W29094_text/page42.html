Aﬂer reaching the end of curve, a tangent was drilled to cross into Section 16, T154N R97W. The end of tangent was reached February 8‘“, 2015 at 7:45 am CT at MD 11,785’ within the Middle Bakken. <br/>Lateral 11,490’ —— 20, 5 00’ MD </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">As drilling of the lateral began, the wellbore was inside the top of the target window. Over the course of the well, formation of the Middle Bakken would show a fairly consistent downdip of 89.3-89.7 degrees until ﬂattening out at approximately MD 19,000 feet and then showing a slight updip of 9023 degrees. The wellbore would range from 2 feet above the target window to 8 feet below the window. Samples collected while drilling within the target window consisted of off white, light tan, tan, and light brown silty dolomitic sandstone. When the wellbore dropped below the target window, samples showed an increased amount of off white to light gray argillaceous platy, dolomitic sandstone. Samples above the target window were similar to samples within the window, with increased amounts of off white sandstone. <br/>At 3:30 am CT, on February 17‘“, 2014, TD was reached at MD 20,760 feet within the Middle Bakken. At TD, the wellbore was in the middle of the target window. Gas readings through the lateral ranged from 17—63 72 total gas units. Gamma ranged from 56-131 API. Samples consisted of varying amounts of cream to tan and light brown silty dolomitic sandstone and off white to gray dolomitic sandstone. </p>

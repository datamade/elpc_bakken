Diilling times in the Lodgepole below KOP were between 1-5 minutes sliding. Gas varied between 11-17 units. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the Lodgepole to correlate to the Iverson 41- 14H hole. Target stayed at <br/>10,279’ based on Lodgepole correlations. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 10,190’ MD 10,145’ TVD -7, 734’ SS </p>

Background gas was from 11 to 145 units in the shale. A typical sample was Shale: Black, very dark gray, carbonaceous, calcareous, pyritic, gritty, blocky, even pale yellow ﬂuorescence, instant bright green milky cut, </p>

This top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The sample lithology of the Middle Bakken consisted of sandstone. A typical sample exhibited medium to light gray sandstone, light to medium grayish brown, with beige to oﬁlwhite inclusions, very ﬁne grained, subrounded, calcareous, limey cementation, moderate sorting, poor intergranular porosity, scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, cloudy bright yellow green cut. <br/>Lower Bakken Shale 10,296’ MD 10,21 7’ T VD — 7,806 ’ SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale was entered at 10,217’ TVD. Backgron gas was from 56 to 175 units in the shale. A typical sample was Shale: Medium gray, grayish brown, trace dark gray, some mottled, carbonaceous, pyritic, gritty, blocky, even pale yellow green ﬂuorescence, instant bright cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Three Forks 10,368’ MD 1 0,25 7’ T VD -7,846 ’ SS </p>

The top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The typical samples consisted of siltstone that was medium grayish brown, light grayish brown, trace 03‘ white, arenaceous, argillaceous, dolomitic, with poor induration, Lithology also included trace to moderate shale that was medium bluish gray, waxy, platy, blocky, with moderate induration. Samples exhibited poor intergranular porosity, light brown oil staining, even to scattered dull to pale yellow green ﬂuorescence, with generally instant bright yellow to yellow-green cuts. <br/>We completed drilling curve at 3:50 am CST on January 22, 2015 at 10,555' MD and True Vertical Depth of 10,291 .92’. </p>

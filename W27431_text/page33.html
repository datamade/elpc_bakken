There are no existing or planned roads on said section line; therefore, no obstruction exists on the section line or within the right-of-way. <br/>Furthermore, section line set asides for rural transportation and utilities are not recognized west of the Missouri River within the exterior boundaries of the Fort Berthold Reservation. The location of the Bross well pad and access road was approved by the BIA Fort Berthold Agency under ROW F BOG100572 aﬁer <br/>due diligence and environmental review with the difﬁcult topography being a controlling factor. <br/>If you require additional information on this matter, please contact the BIA Superintendent at 701-6274707 or Mark Johnson with HRC Operating at 303-297-2028. <br/>  <br/>cc: Mr. Richard Rymerson, Field Manager BLM - North Dakota Field Oﬁice 99 23rd Avenue West, Suite A Dickinson, North Dakota 58502 <br/>  </p>

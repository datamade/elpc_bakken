A trip was performed at 9,770 feet measured depth at 9:30 PM CST on December 12TH, 2014 to pick up the curve assembly. Aﬁer rotating ten feet to 9,780 feet measured depth, drilling of the curve began shortly aﬁer 10:30 AM CST on December 13”, 2014. <br/>Correlations were made with the Sirp #12-12TFH as well as the Smith #41-12H MWD logs using seven individual Lodgepole correlative markers and formation tops. The initial landing target based on the geological prognosis was set at 10,350 feet true vertical depth. Prior to beginning the curve, the landing target was raised to 10,337 feet true vertical depth based on the Lodgepole top. No further changes were made while building the curve. Typical samples in the lower Lodgepole consisted of light to medium gray, brown, gray tan, cream, cream gray, medium tan to tan, light brown, very ﬁne to microcrystalline, slightly argillaceous limestone, with trace anhydrite, and scattered light brown oil staining. <br/>False Bakken 10,256’ MD 10,1 73 ’ TVD -7,818’ SS <br/>False Bakken was picked at a measured depth of 10,256 feet, 10,173 feet true vertical depth. The Scallion was logged at 10,263 feet measured depth, 10,177 feet true vertical depth. Background gas averaged 175 units following the Scallion and into the Upper Bakken. <br/>Upper Bakken 10,290’MD 10,193’ TVD -7,838’SS <br/>Upper Bakken was reached at 10,290 feet measured depth; 10,193 feet true vertical depth with drill rates ranging ﬁ‘om .6 to 1.1 minutes per foot. Background gas averaged 650 units through the Upper Bakken. Samples consisted of dark gray to black, blocky, carbonaceous shale, with trace amounts of dolomite and limestone, with a scattered yellow green ﬂuorescence, and instant cloudy, slow streaming yellow green cut, with cut drying to a good yellow gold ﬂuorescence halo, and under white light, gradually turning strong amber. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,31 7’ MD 10,208 ’ TVD -7, 853 ’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Middle Bakken was picked at 10,317 feet measured depth; 10,208 feet true vertical depth marked by a drop in penetration rates, and transition from shale to dolomitic, silty limestone noted in samples. Samples consisted of predominately medium to dark gray, gray brown, light gray, moderately dolomitic, argillaceous, slightly pyritic, platy siltstone with poor induration, and heavy dark gray aigillaceous banding. Also present was up to 60 percent light to medium brown, light gray, very ﬁnely grained to silty, sub angular to sub rounded sandstone that was poorly to moderately sorted and poor to fair calcitic cementation. Samples transitioned to predominately siltstone following 10,356 feet measured depth, marked by an increase in average gamma from the 45 to 60 to between 90 and 110 API range. Background gas averaged 150 units through the Middle Bakken. <br/>Lower Bakken 10,449 ’ MD 10,273 ’ T VD —7,918’ SS <br/>Lower Bakken was picked at 10,449 feet measured depth; 10,273 feet true vertical depth, with a sharp increase in gamma, and transition of samples from siltstone to black, light to medium gray, tan gray, cream gray, off white, smooth to gritty carbonaceous shale, with trace to moderate light cream gray microcrystalline dolomite. Drill rates in the Lower Bakken averaged .4 to 1 minutes per foot, with an average 510 units of background gas. </p>

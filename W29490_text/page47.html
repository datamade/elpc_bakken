Slides were no able to control the inclination, and the wellbore descended through the window, and exited the base following 14,750 feet measured depth. Slides were again implemented, and the wellbore returned to the base of the window following 14,900 feet measured depth, and remained Within the window for the remainder of the drilling day.

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">On the drilling day of the 19TH of December, drill rates averaged between 160 and 180 feet per hour while rotating, and from 30 to 60 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 511 units. The wellbore dropped below the base of the target window between 15,850 and 16,650 feet measured depth. Slides were again unable to control the inclination within the target window, and the wellbore continued to ascend, leaving the top of the target window between 17,120 and 17,320 feet measured depth. Observed dip rate changed slightly to 89.8 degrees. <br/>Through the 20m of December, drill rates decreased to between 120 and 160 feet per hour while rotating, and from 40 to 80 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 452 units. Observed dip rate increased signiﬁcantly to 89.3 degrees between 17,320 and 17,470 feet measured depth. Projected dip remained 89.3 for the remainder of the lateral. While returning to bottom following a slide, differential pressure was lost at 17,807 feet measured depth. Following troubleshooting steps on surface, a trip was performed to pick up lateral BHA number two, beginning at 11:00 AM CST on December 20”. The draw works failed during the trip, and repairs were conducted between 6:00 PM CST and 12:00 AM CST of the 215T. Began trip in at 1:00 AM CST. <br/>The trip was completed at 9:00 AM CST on the 21ST of December, and lateral drilling resumed, with drill rates while rotating averaging between 170 and 190 feet per hour. Background gas averaged 592 units, with a 4,159 unit trip gas circulated with bottoms up. The wellbore re-entered the top of the target window following 17,850 feet measured depth, and remained within the window through lateral TD. No additional correlative gamma markers were encountered, but dip appeared slightly shallower than the projected 89.3, as the wellbore neared the top of the window without encountering markers as anticipated. <br/>The Fladeland #31-12 Three Forks lateral number one reached a total depth of 19,400 feet measured depth approximately two feet below the top of the target window shortly before 4:00 AM CST on Monday, December 22’“), 2014, 15 days from spud, at 925 feet from the south line, and 543 feet from the east line of the SE SE V: of Section 13, Township 153N, Range 92W, Mountrail County, North Dakota. <br/>Derek Lidstrom, Wellsite Mudlogger </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation’s Fladeland #31-12TFH is a horizontal well targeting the Three Forks formation, to be drilled in a south southeast direction at a vertical section azimuth of 174.09 degrees for approximme 9,336 feet vertical section. The well is located in the NW ‘/4, NE ‘/4, Section 12 Township 153N Range 92W of Mountrail County, northwest of New Town, North Dakota. <br/>This well spud in on December 6TH, 2014 at 4:00 AM CST. Well site geological services began at 8,500 feet measured depth on December 12TH, 2014 shortly before 1:30 AM CST. Ten, <br/>ﬁfteen, thirty, and ﬁﬁy-foot lagged samples were caught by mud loggers and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>A thirteen and one half inch wellbore was drilled to 2,300 feet measured depth, and nine and ﬁve eighths inch casing was run and cemented in place. The remaining vertical wellbore and curve was drilled, and seven inch intermediate casing was ran and set at 10,726 feet measured depth. One six inch bit was used while drilling lateral number one, re-ran after a trip. Neset Consulting Service, Inc. Total gas hotwire monitoring system was used for the duration of logging services. <br/>The Fladeland #31-12TFH vertical wellbore, with original curve, reached a total depth of 10,738 feet measured depth at 4:00 AM CST on December 15TH, 2014, approximately 20 feet into the Three Forks, 9 days from spud. Horizontal leg began shortly before 9:00 PM CST on December 16"“, 2014, reaching a total measured depth of 19,400 feet on December 22’“), 2014 shortly before 4:00 AM CST, 15 days from spud. <br/>Began logging in the Charles Formation <br/>Logging services began at 8,500 feet measured depth in the Charles formation shortly after 1:30 AM CST on December 12”, 2014. Charles consisted primarily of anhydrite, limestone, and interlaminated dolomitic lenses, along with trace to moderate reddish orange shale. Drill rates ranged from one to two minutes per foot. Background gas averaged 95 units. Base of the last salt was picked at 8,595 feet measured depth, 8,594 feet true vertical depth, with a drill break of .4 to 1 minutes per foot. Samples following consisted primarily of limestone, anhydrite, and minor dolomite, with a varying presence of shale through the Mission Canyon. </p>

The Mission Canyon consisted of predominantly light to medium cream gray, microcrystalline, fairly argillaceous limestone, off white to cream white anhydrite and light tan, micro to cryptocrystalline dolomite. Drill rates averaged l to 1.3 minutes per foot through the Mission Canyon, with 100 units of average background gas. Even white mineral ﬂuorescence and slow, <br/>pinpoint streaming cut present in majority of samples caught. </p>

Surface location of the Alexander 26-35 STFH is 262’ FNL and 2,252’ FEL Section 26, Tier 155 North, Range 99 West, Williams County, North Dakota. Bottom hole location of Alexander 26—35 6H is 238.93’ FNL and 1,072.11’ FEL, Section 35, Tier 15 SN, Range 99 W, Williams County, North Dakota. <br/>The Alexander 26-35 6H spudded on September 1 1, 2014 and reached a total depth of 20,960’ on October 24, 2014 44 days from spud. The well was drilled vertically from surface to a MD of 10,441’ at kick off point (KOP). Drilling continued to intermediate casing point and seven inch intermediate casing was set at MD 11,438’. Ultimately TD was reached on October, 24 2014. Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided mud logging services from a measured depth of 8,000' on September 19, 2014 at 11:10 PM CDT. Heidi Smith was the main wellsite geologist for the entire well, while Anthony Garman took temporary duties from OctoberlO, 2014 to October 14, 2014. Pati Clausen was the regular mud logger. Samples from a measured depth of 8,000’ were caught, described and logged by Neset Consulting personnel. Neset Consulting Services included, sample logging, gamma monitoring and gas monitoring. Neset Consulting Gas provided Total Gas detection equipment. Thirty-foot samples were caught through the vertical and curve while 50 foot samples were captured in the lateral. <br/>Logging began in the Arnsden Memeber at 8,000’ on September19, 2014 at 11:10 PM CDT. Drilling continued to intermediate casing point (MD 11,451) in the Middle Bakken, approximately 21’ beneath the Upper Bakken Shale. The curve was landed at 90 degrees and TVD 11,073’. <br/>VERTICAL 1WD 8,000’ —MD 10,451’ CURVE MD 10,441’ —MD 11,419’ <br/>While logging the upper hole no signiﬁcant geological features were logged. Drilling in rotation went as expected ranging mostly between 40 ﬁ/hr to 75 ft/hr. Samples were consistent with known lithology. Gas values logged ranged from 35 units to around 264 units, most of the higher gas values were logged in the Mission Canyon Formation. Some sliding was utilized to correct deviation from the vertical. Gamma data was not gathered by a wire line at the end of the curve. Then Gamma was gatherbe by the Learn Sensor once we tripped back in the lower Mission Canyon, therefore the formation tops above this depth were chosen on based on sample and ROP changes. Some of the formation tops have been chosen with sample and the assistance of the gamma data gathered alter cementing the curve, however the reliability of the gamma at points is questionable. Those tops are as follows: <br/>TYLER MD 8,160’ TVD 8,159’ SS—5,825 ’ OTTER MD 8,335 ’ T VD 8,334 ’ SS-6,000’ </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>The Tyler and Otter exhibited typical lithology changes. At the Tyler we entered the typical gray and black shale. Some was also sandy and questionable oil shows were noted. gain at the Otter the typical gray and green shale were present. <br/>M4DDISON MD 8, 724’ TVD 8, 723’ SS -6,389’ FIRST SALT: MD 8, 798’ TVD 8, 797’ SS ~6,463’ BLS: MD 9,516’ TVD 9,513’ SS -7,177’ RATTCLIFFE MD 9,366 ’ TVD 9,365 ’ SS -7,031 ’ BLS 1WD 9,510’ TVD 9,509’ SS -7,197’ <br/>Again chosen mostly from sample and ROP the members of the Madison had some questionable gamma readings to use. The sample where just below a bed of anhydrite, a bed of siltstone with scattered salt was logged, the Madison Formation was identiﬁed. Penetration rates became more steady through this upper section of the Madison and averaged 64.5 ﬁ/hr. No signiﬁcant gas values were logged and averaged 50 units through the upper portion of the Madison. The ﬁrst Charles Salt bed was chosen at MD 8,798 where a signiﬁcant amount of salt was logged from sample. Drilling through the salts penetration rates were smooth averaging 60 ﬁ/hr. Drilling through the limestone and anhydrite beds of the Madison were more erratic, ranging from 20 ﬁ/hr to 50 ﬁlm. The Base of the Last Salt was chosen at MD 9,510’fTVD 9,509’. This choice was based chieﬂy on ROP. <br/>MISSION CANYON MD 9, 664’ TVD 9, 663’ SS - 7,329’ FROBISHER ALIDA MD 9, 756’ TVD 9, 755’ SS -7,421’ <br/>The top of the Mission Canyon was chosen where the limestone changed from shades of gray to a carbonaceous brown limestone. Gas values increased from values as high as 163 units with lower gas values reading around 120 units. ROP ranged from 30 ﬁ/hr to 60 ﬁ/hr. The Frobisher Alida was chosen at MD 9,756’ ITVD 9,755’ and was chosen where dead oil stains were logged in the samples. Penetration rates slowed in the lower Mission Canyon to an average of 25 ﬁ/hr. Gas values increased to as high as 505 units. <br/>LODGEPOLE MD 10,353 ’ TVD 10,352’ SS -8, 019’ <br/>The Lodgepole was the ﬁrst top where gamma was useful in identiﬁcation. lithology changes were typical; changing ﬁ'om tan colored limestone to gray limestone. Penetration rates increased at his lithology change to an average of 40 ﬁ/hr. Gas values decreased gradually in the middle of this section to 50 units. Gas values increased some in the lower Lodgepole, showing values around 4,512 units ((between the False Bakken and the Upper Bakken Shale). </p>

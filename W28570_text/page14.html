    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>BAKKEN MD 11,206 ’ TVD 11,032’ SS —8,698’ MIDDLE BAKKEN MD 11,266 TVD 11, 052’ SS -8, 718’ <br/>The Bakken was chosen from gamma, sample and penetration rate change. It was logged at MD 11,206’IT VD 10,032’. The typical warm up in gamma was seen, along with samples being described as black pyritic shale. The penetration rate while sliding into the Bakken increased to 40 ft/hr from about 20 ﬂ/hr. The Middle Bakken’s typical cool down in gamma was logged dropping from values over 200 api to values mostly in the 80’s and 900’s api. There is a sectionlo feet below the upper shale that cooled into the 30’s api. It is approximately 2.5 feet thick. Gas values on initial entrance were in the 3000unit to 6000 unit range. <br/>LATERAL 1 MD 11,451’-20,960’ <br/>Drilling resumed for the lateral portion on October 2, 2013 at 12:18 AM CDT. This geological summary is based on the last comprehensive interpretation of the structure. <br/>The well bore was brought up into the target window at curve landing. Drilling continued moving up section to MI) 11,670’where the well bore was turned over. Drilling continued in the upper target window to MD 12,620’. This section showed gamma ranging from about 108 api to 124 api. Just below this upper window there is a small one foot this section that drops into the 80’s api. Lithology in the upper pare of the window was described as a tan gray to cream microsucrosic dolomite. <br/>The well bore dropped through the ﬁll] target window ﬁom MD 12,620’ to MD 13,000’. The gamma remains fairly steady in through the entire thickness hovering around 110 api. Lithology in this section exhibited more shale laminations and consequently less of a sucrosic nature, along with more silty nature. <br/>The well bore then followed the lower target window to MD 16,600’. Gamma was much more erratic as it scrapped along this lower gamma marker but just above it ranged in the 90’s to 110 api. Samples in this section were hard to distinguish from the samples in the middle of the window. However it seems if they were taken from just above the target window they had more gray nature to them and if they happened to scrape into the lower low gamma marker they included some brown dolomite. <br/>At this point the well bore then rose in inclination to enter the top of the window. This time there was a different tool in the hole but we bounced of the upper cool marker <br/>several times. No notable differences were seen in lithology that have not been covered already. <br/>There was no notable changes toward the end other than entering a warmer gamma (130’s api) at the end that is interpreted to correlate with gamma seen at MD 11,900’. Lithology through this drilling was again darker gray to gray brown with the heaviest of shale laminations seen throughout drilling. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">directional team returned to taking ninety foot surveys for the duration of the lateral. At the completion of the azimuth turn a target adjustment was made to equate the target window with expected formation dip: target adjustment #2 raised target line 3’ and maintained a target inclination of 89.7 degrees. Formation moved through several steeper localized dips over the next 3,600’ MD, causing the target line to exit the bottom of the target window. Target adjustment #3 raised the target line 4’ while maintaining the existing 89.7 degree target inclination. At this point the wellbore was in the lower half of the TVD target window, where gamma patterns were more difﬁcult to recognize. The directional team was having difﬁculties sliding back up into the center or top half of the target window to conﬁrm dip, indicating that the bottom of the target window contained a hard streak. After difﬁculty sliding, the Company Man decided to TOOH on December 15, 2014 at 16,210’ MD due to drill rates that had fallen under 90 ft/hr. Drilling resumed the next day with a new bit, motor, and MWD. The directional team was able to move up in zone and conﬁrm a formation dip near 89.7 degrees. This dip was short lived, and within 12 hours gamma patterns tentatively conﬁrmed that formation dip has decrease to 89.4 degrees, causing the wellbore to exit the top of the target window. Target adjustment #4 lowered the target line 5’ in zone and maintained the existing 89.7 degree target inclination to bring the wellbore back into the ideal geological window and confirm formation dip using the clean gamma located in the center of the target window. For the next 2,000’ VS the directional team attempted to rotate and slide down to the new line, but clean gamma was not observed within the new target window. Targets were dropped again later that day to move the wellbore down even farther in an attempt to conﬁrm gamma dip. Target adjustment #5 lowered the target line an additional 5’ with no changes to the existing 89.7 target inclination. At this point it seemed that formation was dropping more aggressively than was expected or observed during the H-1 Three Forks lateral. The main goal was to drill down to the clean gamma to verify that the well was within the ideal geological zone. After drilling 1,500’ MD formation dip was less ambiguous thanks to several smaller gamma wraps along the top of the ideal geological zone. It was still an ideal goal to drill through the clean gamma for a more exact formation dip, and when the existing target line began to leave the ideal zone, a ﬁnal target adjustment was made to ﬁne tune the window. Target adjustment #6 lowered the target line 2’ in zone and continued using the existing 89.7 degree target inclination. During the remaining 400’ of the lateral the directional team rotated at an inclination of 88.8 — 89.10 degrees, over— taking formation dip and ﬁnally drilling through the entirety of the ideal geological window and conﬁrming an average formation dip near 89.6 — 89.7 degrees. The well was completed 8’ low of the target drilling line, just below the ideal geological window. <br/>Total depth was reached on December 18, 2014 at 5:25 pm. CST at a measured depth of 20,838’ and a true vertical depth of 10,848.37’. The Three Forks lateral took a total of 5 days and 22 hours to complete, including surveys and down time. The lateral was drilled approximately 50% in zone with an average background gas of 136 units (including connection gases). Average drill rate was 120 ft/hr including slides, with max ROP reaching 175 ft/hr continuously in sections. The EN-VP&R-154-94-2536H-3 bottom hole location would be 771.19' F SL & 1,038.59' FEL in Section 36 T154N R94W. </p>

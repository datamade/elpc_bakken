The Lodgepole was determined offof the pre-determined Lodgepole gamma marker and subtle color change in samples. Four Lodgepole markers were recorded before reaching kick off point at 10,180' MD. KOP was reached at 3:45 am on November 3, 2014. The <br/>rig then pulled out of the hole to pick up the build curve assembly. </p>

The Lodgepole consisted of soft to ﬁrm limestone, that is also light gray, gray, and light gray brown in color. Landing estimations ﬂuctuated as high as 10,789' TVD and as low as 10,797' TVD throughout the Lodgepole formation with the original projected TVD set at 10,786' TVD. The ideal landing was set at 10, 791 ’ TVD once recording the top ofthe Three Forksformaz‘iorz at 10, 759' TVD. <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale formation was encountered at the base of the Lodgepole formation at a MD of 10,715‘ and a TVD of 10,616'. The lithology of shale was black in color and very carbonaceous with fair yellow oil shows. The top of the Bakken shale was 6' low from projection which projected the estimated landing to 10,792' TVD. After 38‘ MD and 24' TVD the base of the Bakken Shale was reached and the top of the Middle Bakken was encountered at a MD of 10,753' and TVD of 10,640', projecting landing at 10,793‘ TVD. Lithology moved from carbonaceous shale to light brown to brown to light brown gray sandstone. Shows maintained fair quality with yellow cuts. Drill rates decreased slightly and averaged 50—60 ﬁ/hr while rotating and sliding. Continued to drill the Middle Bakken formation on the way to the Lower Bakken Shale which was encountered at a measured depth of 10,869' MD and a TVD of 10,702', trending along with projection. The lithology of the Lower Bakken Shale was similar to the upper shale and consisted of black carbonaceous shale, fairly brittle, with interbedded pyrite. Oil shows continued to be good quality and background gas ranged 150 to 700 units. Entered the lower shale at approximately 63 degree inclination and exited at 70 degrees inclination in the Three Forks formation. The Three Forks formation was recorded aﬁer a gamma count decrease below 150 units at 11,012 ' MD and 10,759' TVD, conﬁrming the ﬁnal landing at 10,791' TVD which targeted 32' into the formation. Lithology moved to a light gray to light blue gray to tan sandstone, which is fairly calcareous, argillaceous in parts, with good oil shows present. The EN-VP&R-154-94—2536H-3 build curve was landed at 11,200' MD and 10,787’ TVD on November 5, 2014 at 2:40 pm. CST. The rig proceeded to ream the curve wellbore and trip out <br/>to lay down build curve tools before picking up 7" casing. <br/>Lateral Three Forks <br/>The EN-VP&R—lS4-94-2536H-3 Three Forks lateral began on December 12, 2014 at 1 1,200’ MD and a TVD of 10,787’ after completing the build curve. Initial targets were set at 89.7 degrees based off the EN-FREDA-154-94-2536H-5 Three Forks lateral. The center target line was set 2’ below landing location. The directional team drilled to the center line before starting the 30 degree azimuth turn at 12,234’ MD to move due south from 150 degrees to 180 degrees. Thirty foot surveys were taken through the duration of the turn, as required by North Dakota state requirements. The ideal geological window targeted a drilling line 32' into the Three Forks formation with a hard line set at 50'. The turn was completed at 12,296’ MD and the </p>

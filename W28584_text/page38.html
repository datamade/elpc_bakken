A typical sample was as follows; SHALE: Black, charcoal, dark brown, slightly calcareous, silty, smooth, carbonaceous and blocky. Drill rates through the Upper Bakken averaged 70 — 120 ft/hr. The gas entering the <br/>Shale was 4,00 units. The inclination of the curve through the Upper Bakken Shale was approximately 49 - 51 degrees. </p>

Samples at this time exhibited trace oil shows and a typical sample was as follows; SANDSTONE: Medium to light gray, light brown, cream gray, off white, translucent, very ﬁne, argillaceous, calcareous, silty in part, trace off white to light gray mottled limestone, poor to fair induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered yellow green ﬂuorescence, streaming to good cloudy yellow cut. Gas in the Middle Bakken averaged 1,800 units. <br/>Lower Bakken Shale 11,566’ MD 11,438’ TVD - 8, 785 ’ SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale was encountered at a measured depth of 11,566” and a TVD of 11,438’. A typical sample was as follows; SHALE: Black, charcoal, dark brown, slightly calcareous, silty, smooth, carbonaceous and blocky. Drill rates through the Upper Bakken averaged 90 — 120 ft/hr.

Samples at this time exhibited trace oil shows and a typical sample was as follows SILTSTONE: Dark gray, dark brown, gray brown, argillaceous even yellow green ﬂuorescence, good cloudy to milky yellow green cut. SANDSTONE: Light brown, cream gray, off white to white, clear to translucent, very ﬁne to ﬁne grained, subrounded to rounded, well sorted, trace light gray green dolomite, fair intergranular porosity, scattered yellow green ﬂuorescence, good streaming to cloudy blue green cut. <br/>Fair gas and oil shows were observed in the Three Forks particularly in the middle of the target window with gamma in the 60 - 100 AP] range. This interval just above the target line is characterized by a lithology consisting of fairly clean, moderately-sorted sandstone with trace dolomite. Below the target window, the formation contained a higher amount of silt resulting in lower porosity and weaker gas and oil shows <br/>Three lateral target changes were done to follow formation changes. Dip angle was calculated from gamma markers and correlations with other wells using data provided by Hess and Neset Consulting. Gas values ranged from 1 l — 6,500 units throughout the Three Forks, averages throughout the lateral were 350 — 9,200 units. Trip gas reached 5,000 — 7,500 units. Several gas tests were done to ensure the accuracy of the equipment. </p>

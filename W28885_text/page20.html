The total gas volume that is unable to be sold through the gas gathering pipeline will be ﬂared through engineered ﬂare system so that optimal combustion can occur and gas sent <br/>to ﬂare will be metered using oriﬁce plates <br/>a. Gas Flare meter volumes for the month are termed WW <br/>5. Determine a theoretical monthly gas production volume for each continuously measured well as follows: <br/>a.  (Post-0P5 review) = Total 835 Volume <br/>continuously measured for month with Volume corrected as necessary by t responsible operations] metering personnel for known upsets/malfunctioning of equipment or measurement devices that impact accuracy of well gas volumes. <br/>6.

Gas Sales/ Flare meters used in the measurement will be calibrated and maintained according to gas gathering contracts with commercial gathering entities and/or industry standard practices if performed by Zavanna, LLC directly. <br/>12. Well gas allocation meters will be checked and calibrated on a standard timespan reﬂective of gas volume magnitude (large volumes quarterly, lower volumes every 6 months). <br/>13. Volumes will be reported to appropriate agencies through routine gas production reports ﬁled monthly. <br/>Associated Oil Tank Gas (aka Vapors] Recovered and Sold wlth Separator Gas: <br/>1. Commingled gas from the discharge of Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU) compressors will be measured either through the Gas Sales meter or the Gas Flare meter and will be allocated back to the well as described in Steps 9 and 10 from the previous section. The use of sales and ﬂare factors will bridge the gap between Theoretical Gas Production and Actual Gas Production. Liquids (aka condensates) recovered from the VRU compressor will go to the tanks and quantities allocated by the method described in Step 6 from the Oil Continuous Metering section of these procedures. <br/>  </p>

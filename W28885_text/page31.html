Metered SW volumes and trucked SW volumes for the month are termed 1m; <br/>w . " Determine a theoretical monthly SW production volume for each continuously measured well as follows: <br/>a.  [post-ops review) = Total SW volume continuously measured for the month with Volume corrected as necessary by responsible operations/ metering personnel for known upsets/malfunctioning of equipment or measurement devices that impact accuracy of Well oil volumes. <br/>Sum all the individual well Theoretical Monthly SW Production volumes to determine the  for the central facility. <br/>Calculate a production factor by dividing the total Actual Monthly SW Production by the Total Theoretical Monthly SW Production. <br/>Determine Won: for each Well by multiplying the respective individual well’s Theoretical Monthly SW Production volume by the productionfacmr calculated in Step 5 above. . <br/>All turbine meters used in measurement will be checked and calibrated on a standard timespan reﬂective of SW volume magnitude (large volumes quarterly, lower volumes every 6 months]. - <br/>Volumes will be reported to appropriate agencies through routine SW production reports ﬁled monthly. </p>

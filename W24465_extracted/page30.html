Cement quality and weight: You must choose a cement slurry that is designed to solve the problems speciﬁc to each casing string. <br/>2. Waiting time: You must hold the cement slurry in place and under pressure until it reaches its' initial set without disturbing it. A cement slurry is a time-dependent liquid and must be allowed to undergo a hydration reaction to produce a competent cement sheath. A fresh cement slurry can be worked (thickening or pump time) as long as it is in a plastic state and before going through its' transition phase. If the cement slurry is not allowed to <br/>gas cutting that may lead to a lack of zonal isolation and possible bridging in the annulus. <br/>1 <br/>3. Pipe movement; Pipe movement may be one of the single most inﬂuential factors in mud removal. Reciprocation and/or rotation mechanically breaks up gelled mud and changes the ﬂow patterns in the annulus to improve displacement efﬁciency. <br/>4.

The 30-minute reading should be less than 20 lb/ 100 W. Sufﬁcient shear stress <br/>may not be achieved on a primary cement job to remove mud left in the hole if the mud were to develop more than 25 lb/ 100 W of gel strength. <br/>Fluid Loss: Decreasing the ﬁltrate loss into a permeable zone enhances the creation of a thin, competent ﬁlter cake. A thin. competent ﬁlter cake created by a low ﬂuid loss mud system is desirable over a thick, partially gelled ﬁlter <br/>cake. A mud system created with a low ﬂuid loss will be more easily displaced. The ﬂuid loss value should be < 15 cc's (ideal would be 5 cc‘s). <br/>3. Circulation: Prior to cementing circulate full hole volume twice, or until well conditioned mud is being returned to the surface. There should be no cutting in the mud returns. An annular velocity of 260 feet per minute is optimum (SPE/IADC 18617), if possible. <br/>6. Flow rate: Turbulent ﬂow is the most desirable ﬂow regime for mud removal. If turbulence cannot be achieved pump at as high a ﬂow rate that can practically and safely be used to create the maximum flow energy. The highest mud removal is achieved when the maximum ﬂow energy is obtained. <br/>7. Pipe Centralization: The Cement will take the path of least resistance. therefore proper centralization is important to help prevent the casing from contacting the borehole wall. A minimum standoff of 70% should be targeted for optimum displacement efﬁciency. <br/>8. Rat hole: A weighted viscous pill placed in the rat hole prior to cementing will minimize the risk of higher density cement mixing with lower density mud when the well is static. <br/>9. Top and Bottom plugs: A top and bottom plug are recommended to be run on all primary casing jobs. The bottom plug should be run after the spacer and ahead of the ﬁrst cement slurry. <br/>10. Spacers and ﬂushes: Spacers and/or flushes should be used to prevent contamination between the cement slurry and the drilling ﬂuid. They are also used to clean the wellbore and aid with bonding. To determine the <br/>volume. either a minimum of 10 minutes contact time or 1000 ft. of annular ﬁll, whichever is greater. is recommended. </p>

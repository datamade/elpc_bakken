    <p class="styleSans22.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">D. Choke Manifold Equipment: <br/>All choke lines will be straight lines unless turns use tee blocks or are targeted with running tees, and will be anchored to prevent whip and vibration. A 4” 10M ﬂex hose may be used from the well head to the choke manifold. <br/>E. Accumulator: <br/>The accumulator will have sufﬁcient capacity to open the hydraulically-controlled gate valve (if so equipped), close all rams plus the annular preventer, and retain a minimum of 200 psi above precharge on the closing manifold without the use of the closing unit pumps. The ﬂuid reservoir capacity will be double the usable ﬂuid volume of the accumulator system capacity and the ﬂuid level of the reservoir will be maintained at the manufacturer’s recommendations. </p>

    <p class="styleSans36.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The BOP system will have two (2) independent power sources available for powering the closing unit pumps. Sufﬁcient nitrogen bottles are suitable as a backup power source only, and shall be recharged when the pressure falls below manufacturer’s speciﬁcations. The accumulator precharge pressure test will be conducted prior to connecting the closing unit to the BOP stack and at least once every six (6) months thereafter. The accumulator pressure will be corrected if the measured precharge pressure is found to be above or below the maximum or minimum limits speciﬁed in Onshore Oil & Gas Order Number 2 (only nitrogen gas may be used to precharge). <br/>A manual locking device (i.e., hand wheels) or automatic locking device will be installed. A valve will be installed in the closing line as close as possible to the annular preventer to act as a locking device. This valve will be maintained in the open position and will be closed only when the power source for the accumulator system is inoperative. <br/>Remote controls shall be readily accessible to the driller. Remote controls for 5M or greater systems will be capable of both opening and closing all preventers. Master controls will be at the accumulator and will be capable of opening and closing all preventers and the choke line valve (if so equipped). <br/>F. Miscellaneous Information: </p>

The hydraulic BOP closing unit will be located at least twenty-ﬁve (25) feet from the well head but readily accessible to the driller. Exact locations and conﬁgurations of the hydraulic BOP closing unit will depend upon the particular rig contracted to drill this hole. <br/>A ﬂare line will be installed after the choke manifold, extending 100 feet (minimum) from the center of the drill hole to a separate ﬂare pit. </p>

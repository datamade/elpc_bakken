The following assurances apply: 1. The well is equipped with new 29#, 7" casing from surface to 9,933' MDI 9,611' TVD with an API burst rating of 8,160psil1 1 ,220psi 2. The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.80* APl burst rating to determine the max pressure. 3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment. 4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during the flowback than during the frac job. 5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates. 6. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing. 7. A 300# gauge will be installed on surface casing during flowback operation. <br/>  <br/>                 <br/>  <br/>  <br/>          <br/>XTO Ener , Inc. 303-397-3745 FOR STATE USE ONLY Address En e lewood CO 80155 W Printed Name <br/>h v n , _ _ Marci Harrinton Title ‘ Date Reulato Anal st December 17, 2014 <br/>Email Address Marci_Harrington n <br/>      <br/>    <br/>              <br/>         <br/>PETROLEUM ENGINEE <br/>       <br/>oener 7 .com </p>

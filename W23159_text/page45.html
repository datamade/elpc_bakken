Oil will be sold via a commingled battery and truck run tickets. Water will be measured via a commingled battery and truck run tickets. <br/>Oil sales volume per well will be calculated as follows: <br/>1. <br/>5. <br/>The oil well test volume will represent the summation of one day (24 hours) of oil production from one well through a dedicated 3 phase separator and dedicated tank battery. Oil volume will be measured by corioilis meter or tank measurement. <br/>Pad oil well test volume will be the summation of the oil well test volume from each well that produces into the associated commingled tank battery. <br/>Monthly sold oil pad volume will represent the sum of the prior month’s run tickets as measured by the purchaser, for all well sin the commingled tank battery. <br/>The allocated monthly sales oil volume will represent the sum of the oil well test volume divided by the Pad oil well test volume times the Monthly sold oil Qad volume. <br/>The allocated monthly sales oil volume will be the basis for allocated revenue to each well. <br/>Water volume per well will be calculated as follows: <br/>1. <br/>The water well test volume will represent the summation of three days (72 hours) of water production from one well through a dedicated 3 phase separator and dedicated tank battery. Water volume will be measured by coriolis, mag, or turbine meter or tank measurement. <br/>Pad water well test volume will be the summation of the water well test volume from each well that produces into the associated commingled tank battery. <br/>Monthly water pad volume will represent the sum of the prior month’s water disposal as measured by the water hauler or pipeline gatherer, for all wells in the commingled tank battery. The allocated monthly water volume will represent the sum of the water well test volume divided by the Pad water well test volume times the Monthly water pad volume. <br/>The allocated monthly water volume will be the basis for allocated water expenses to each well. </p>

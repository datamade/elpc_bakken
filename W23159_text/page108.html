Drilling rates in the Lodgepole above KOP of 10,274’ MD ranged from 0.34—2.0 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 1.03 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 3973 units averaging 57 units. Typical samples were: LIMESTONE: Gray, dark gray, light gray, brown gray to light gray brown, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, dolomitic in part, fair to good induration, poor to no intergranular porosity, dull green ﬂorescence, fast milky cut. Curve tools were picked up once kick oﬂ‘ point of 10,274’ MD was reached at 8:45 AM MST on January 6, 2015. <br/>Curve 10,274’-11,127’ MD <br/>Drilling of the curve began at 9: 10 PM MST on January 6, 2015. An initial landing target of 10,750’ TVD was set before curve was started. Drilling rates in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged from 03—367 minutes per foot with an average of 0.89 minutes per foot. Gas in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged from 22-157 units with average of 57 units. Gamma ranged from 12-70 API with an average of 30 API.

The State 154-102-25-369TFH was spudded on November 8, 2014 with surface drilled and cased to be resumed at a later date. Patterson 320 spudded the State 154-102-25-36-9TFH on January 2, 2015 and reached a total depth of 20,328’ MD on January 19, 20151 Wellsite geological services began at 9,000 on January 5, 2015 at 11:15 PM MST. The initial phase of the State 154-102-25-36—9TFH is a vertical and curve landing in the Three Forks Formation on January 7, 2015. The single lateral well targeting the Three Forks Formation approximately 7’-14’ below the base of the Lower Bakken Dolomite was started on January 9, 2015. Thirty-foot samples were collected throughout the vertical and curve with ﬁfty foot samples collected in the lateral. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 9, 000’ - 10,2 74’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 9,000’ MD in the Charles/Madison formation on January 5, 2015 at 11:15 PM MST. Gas detection system was tested before logging depth with system ﬁlnctioning correctly. Drill rates before encountering the Base Last Salt ranged from 0.45-1.67 minutes per foot and averaging 0.71 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 45-107 units averaging 65 units. A typical sample was: LIMESTONE: Gray to gray brown, cream tan to tan, light brown to light brown gray, cryptocrystalline, ﬁrm to ﬁiable, slightly argillaceous, dolomitic in part, fair induration, poor to no intergranular porosity, trace cream white anhydrite, spotted yellow green ﬂuorescence, weak milky cut. </p>

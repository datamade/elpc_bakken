Status MCFID Comments <br/>m— mn— mm .2! <br/>                      <br/>  <br/>Pipeline Notification <br/>These wells will be connected to ONEOK’S low pressure gathering system in Dunn County, North Dakota. Oxy’s acreage that comprises the spacing units (SU) for the Kary 5-24-13H-l44— 97L and State 3-25-36H—144-97L is dedicated to ONEOK. Under terms of the contract, ONEOK is obligated to install the facilities that are required to connect these wells to its gathering system. Oxy provides (on a monthly basis) to ONEOK a drilling, completion and estimated ﬁrst production date for all wells that are scheduled to be drilled in the foreseeable future. In addition, Oxy and ONEOK have conference calls, usually bi-weekly, to discuss connection status of wells and changes to Oxy’s drilling and completion schedules. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">ONEOK’S gathering system in this area is a dynamic system that has multiple compressor stations with common suction lines. Gas produced from this pad will have a primary ﬂow path to ONEOK’s Lodgepole compressor station and secondary ﬂow paths to ONEOK’S Killdeer and Little Knife compressor stations. The actual ﬂow of the gas will be based on compression operating parameters and gathering system pressures. Gas gathered on this part of ONEOK’S gathering system is processed at ONEOK’s Grassland Processing Plant located in Section 36, T146N, RIOSW, McKenzie County, North Dakota. <br/>In addition to ONEOK, Petro-Hunt owns and operates a low pressure gathering line approximately three miles west from the ONEOK tie-in point for this pad. Hiland has a low pressure gathering line approximately one mile west of the State Kary 3O Pad location. Oxy owns and operates an oil gathering system that will be connected to the tank facilities at this pad location which has an extra line that could be used to gather gas to increase capacity in the <br/>vicinity of this well._Hiland’s and Petro-Hunt’s lines, along with ONEOK’s, are shown on the attached map. <br/>The production facilities for the Kary 5-24-13H-144-97L and State 3-25-36H-144-97Lwi11 be located within 500’ of ONEOK’s existing 8.625” outside diameter (OD) low pressure gathering system. The connection to ONEOK will require less than 500’ of either 4.50” OD low pressure gathering line and related facilities. </p>

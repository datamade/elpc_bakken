LLC SUBJECT: Sigurd Pad Gas Capture Plan Afﬁdavit <br/>K <br/>Zavanna LLC is submitting the following signed afﬁdavit in accordance with the new Gas Capture plan requirements in effect May 31, 2014. <br/>Zavanna, LLC (here after referred to as Zavanna) has contracted through 1804 LTD. LLC (here after referred to as 1804) to capture the gas from the Sigurd Well Pad. Zavanna has informed 1804 of the anticipated completion date of the Sigurd (July, 1it 2015) as well as the anticipated Flush Production rates of 2.8 MMcf/d of gas and 3,225 bbls/d of oil. <br/>1804 currently has a 45 MMcf/d refrigeration plant dedicated solely to Zavanna. 1804 is contractually obligated to accept 95% of all Zavanna's production gas volumes anticipated for the life of the ﬁelds feeding into the Springbrook Gas plant. The current maximum daily capacity of this line is 60 MMcfd with a maximum throughput of 23.6 MMcfd. At this time there are no known expansion plans. nor issues. that Zavanna is aware of in regards to 1804’s ability to gather our gas production. <br/>In the month of July 2014 in Stockyard Creek Field, statewide, Zavanna produced 214.844 MCF and ﬂared 91,347 MCF equaling 42.52%. in the month of July 2014. in the Stockyard Creek Field, Zavanna produced 59.925 MCF and ﬂared 42.775 MCF equaling 71.35%. As a note, this is under Zavanna's current gas gathering contract that is not through 1804. <br/>Zavanna has contracted with 1804 to gather gas production in the Stockyard Creek & Crazy Man Creek ﬁeld — starting October 3rd - in the expectation of reducing companywide ﬂaring to a maximum 5%; subsequently guaranteeing that Zavanna is exceeding North Dakota State requirements for now and in the future. <br/>if there are any questions please feel free to call me at 303-595-8004. <br/>Thank you for your time. 7 <br/>I // A 8733;; gig <br/>David Hodges <br/>Senior VP Operations Zavanna.

When the water chlorides are greater than 100,000 ppm and the produced ﬂuids contain no sand, the wells will be turned to production facilities. Since the pipeline is already at the location of the pad and Oxy will have its production facilities constructed before ﬂowback starts, and gas sales should start as soon as the wells start ﬂowing through the production facilities, unless there are capacity issues on ONEOK’s system at that time. Based on current information, it is our belief the system can take this gas upon completion of the three wells. <br/>The typical well on this pad will initially ﬂow 700 barrels of oil and 300 thousand cubic feet of gas per day based on Oxy’s production type curve of this area. Based on current drilling and completion plans, these wells will be completed in the same timeframe. For the three wells, Oxy projects a peak oil rate of 2,100 barrels and a peak gas rate of 900 thousand cubic feet per day from the pad. It is anticipated these wells will decline sharply after initial production as do the majority of horizontal wells in the Williston Basin. <br/>Current Flaring <br/>The table below shows gas being ﬂared by Oxy per North Dakota State Industrial Commission’s March 2014 Oil and Gas Production Report. </p>

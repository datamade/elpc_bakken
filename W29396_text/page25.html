    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">At the terminus of the metering, associated piping at the well’s production facilities and the 500’ of 4.50” OD low pressure gathering line noted above, a connection will be made to an existing 6.625” OD gathering line. This 6.625” OD gathering line extends approximately 0.5 miles and then connects to a 4.50” OD gathering line. The 4.50” OD gathering line extends approximately 1.0 mile and then connects to a 6.625” gathering line. The 6.625” OD gathering line extends approximately 4 miles and then connects to a 16” 0D gathering line. The 16” OD gathering line extends approximately 20 miles and then connects to the inlet station piping at ONEOK’s Lodgepole compressor station. This will be the primary ﬂow path of gas delivered to ONEOK from this pad. As noted under “Gathering System”, above, the gas will have secondary ﬂow paths due to the dynamics of ONEOK’S gathering system. The table below shows the capacities and current ﬂows of the primary gathering lines connecting this well. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">ONEOK’s low pressure gathering system is near capacity in this area due to several new wells recently connected. It is projected that the system will have capacity when theses wells are ready for production due to decline on the existing wells gathered on this segment of the system and ONEOK’S project listed in the following paragraph. <br/>ONEOK is in the process of adding compressors at its Lost Bridge compressor station in Section 14, T147N, R96W, Dunn County and installing a 16” OD low pressure gathering line that will start in T145N, R94W, Dunn County (Dunn Center) and end at the inlet of the Lost Bridge compressor station. Construction of these facilities will redirect gas that currently ﬂows on the primary and secondary ﬂow paths of the State Gresz 35 Pad to ﬂow on the new facilities. Although this does not directly increase the capacity of the primary and secondary ﬂow paths of the State Gresz 35 Pad, it redirects gas that currently ﬂows on the same pipelines to a different compressor station, in essence reducing volumes transported on the ﬂow paths for this well. ONEOK is also planning on constructing a new discharge line from its Lost Bridge compressor station that will deliver some of the gas currently processed at ONEOK’s Grasslands Processing Plant to ONEOK’s Garden Creek Processing Plant(s). </p>

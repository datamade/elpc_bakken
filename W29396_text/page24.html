MCF/D Comments State 6resze35-26H-143—98 ApplymgforADP .53— <br/>State Gresz 1-35-26H-143-98 mm Connected to ONEOK State Hecker 1-2-11H-142-93 Imm- Connected to ONEOK <br/>       <br/>             <br/>Pipeline Notiﬁcation <br/>These wells will be connected or are connected to ONEOK’s low pressure gathering system in Billings County, North Dakota. Oxy’s acreage that comprises the spacing units (SU) for the State Gresz 6-35-26H—143-98 is dedicated to ONEOK. Under terms of the contract, ONEOK is obligated to install the facilities that are required to connect these wells to its gathering system. Oxy provides (on a monthly basis) to ONEOK a drilling, completion and estimated ﬁrst production date for all wells that are scheduled to be drilled in the foreseeable future. In addition, Oxy and ONEOK have conference calls, usually bi-weekly, to discuss connection status of wells and changes to Oxy’s drilling and completion schedules. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Gathering System <br/>ONEOK’s gathering system in this area is a dynamic system that has multiple compressor stations with common suction lines. Gas produced from this pad will have a primary ﬂow path to ONEOK’s Lodgepole compressor station and secondary ﬂow paths to ONEOK’s Killdeer and Little Knife compressor stations. The actual ﬂow of the gas will be based on compression operating parameters and gathering system pressures. Gas gathered on this part of ONEOK’s <br/>gathering system is processed at ONEOK’S Grassland Processing Plant located in Section 36, T146N, R105W, McKenzie County, North Dakota. <br/>In addition to ONEOK, Petro-Hunt owns and operates a low pressure gathering line approximately two mile north from the ONEOK tie-in point for this pad. Hiland has a low pressure gathering line approximately two miles south of the State Gresz 35 Pad location. Hiland’s and Petro-Hunt’s lines, along with ONEOK’s, are shown on the attached map. <br/>The production facilities for the State Gresz 6-35-36H—143-98 will be located less than 500’ from ONEOK’s existing 6.625” outside diameter (OD) low pressure gathering line. The connection to <br/>ONEOK will require less than 500’ of 4.50” OD low pressure gathering line and related facilities. </p>

It is a single Three Forks well with a Pilot hole drilling into the Duperow. The Golden was spud on 19 August, 2014 and reached a total depth of MD 27,141 on October 9, 2014; 9 5/8” surface casing was set to 1,957’ MD. 7” casing was set at 10,591’ MD. Matt Buckalew, Tom Abar, Jim Campbell, Chad Olson and Trevor Meyers of Neset Consulting Service Inc. provided mud logging and geological services for this well. Lagged samples were caught and saved for archive at 30’, 50’ intervals. Sample quality was good in the vertical and curve. At times samples were poor in the lateral due to lube sweeps. A set of boxed samples will be sent to the state of North Dakota and the other to Fargo Data Solutions, Inc. The formation tops for the Kibbey through the Lodgepole were picked off of Gamma and samples. MWD information was provided by Scientiﬁc MWD personnel. <br/>Kibbey Lime MD 7,636 ’ TVD 7,635 ’ SS «5,5 77’ <br/>The Kibbey Lime came in at TVD 7,635’, 11’ low to prognosis. ROP was 2.1 min/ﬂ with 11 units of background gas. A typical sample was; LIMESTONE: Light gray, mudstone to wackestone, dolomitic in part, argillaceous, trace anhydritic, poor to moderate induration, tight, trace sandstone, reddish gray, ﬁne grained, subrounded, silty, no visable porosity, no ﬂuorescence, no cut. No signiﬁcant hydrocarbon shows were observed. <br/>Charles MD 7,811’ TVD 7,810’ SS -5, 752’ <br/>The Charles top came in at TVD 7,810’, 30’ low to prognosis. We encountered several salt, anhydrite, siltstone and limestone beds. The ROP averaged .83 min/ﬂ except in the anhydrites where it went to about .7 min/ﬂ. Gas averaged 11 units. A typical sample was; LIMESTONE: Light gray, light brown, packstone, argillaceous, moderate induration, ﬁiable, anhydrite, white, light gray, amorphous, mineral ﬂuorescence only, no cut. No signiﬁcant hydrocarbon shows were observed. <br/>Base of Last Salt MD 8,230’ TVD 8,229’ SS -6,1 71 ’ <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was picked oﬁ‘ of ROP and MWD at TVD 8,229’. This was 7 low to prognosis. ROP averaged .5 minutes/foot. Gas averaged 17 units. A typical sample was; SALT: Clear, frosty, hard, massive, halite. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">False Bakken MD 9, 829’ TVD 9, 756’ SS —7,698’ <br/>There was a 2’ section of deﬁned False Bakken. ROP averaged .Smin/ft, while sliding, with background gas of 43 units. A sample from this section; ARGILLACEOUS DOLOSTONE: Dark gray, medium gray, granular, calcareous, moderate induration, no visible porosity, spotty yellow ﬂuorescence, no cut. At 10:00 at 9,850'MD on September 14, 2014 started TOOH due to not getting build rates. Changed motor and put on a rock bit. Got back to bottom at 4:30am on September 15, 2014 <br/>Upper Bakken MD 9,859’ T VD 9, 777’ SS -7, 719’ <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was picked from ROP, gamma and lithology change. ROP was controlled at 1.26 minutes a foot with background gas averaging 83 units with a high of 371 units. Gamma was off the charts. Typical sample is: SHALE: Black, calcareous, trace sandy, carbonaceous, gritty, blocky, no ﬂuorescence, bright white cut. <br/>Middle Bakken MD 9, 886’ TVD 9, 796’ SS -7, 738’ <br/>The Middle Bakken came in at MD 9,886’; TVD 9,796’. This pick was made off gamma and lithology change. ROP averaged 1.63 minutes a foot with background gas of 86 units. A typical sample for this formation was; ARENACEOUS DOLOMITE: Light brown, light gray, brown, ﬁne to very ﬁne granular, argillaceous, calcareous, silty, ﬁrm to well indurated, trace intergranular porosity, rare dark brown oil staining, even greenish gray ﬂuorescence, fast milky streaming cut. <br/>Lower Bakken 9, 930’ MD 9, 824’ T VD -7, 766’ SS <br/>The Lower Bakken was entered at TVD 9,824’ and was 31’ thick. ROP while drilling and sliding was 1.21 min/ﬂ with 714 units of background gas. A typical sample was; SHALE: Black, carbonaceous, dolomitic, smooth, platy, faint yellow ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy cut. <br/>Three Forks 9,990’ MD 9,85 7’ T VD -7, 799’ SS <br/>The Three Forks formation was entered at TVD 9,857 ’. ROP .43 min/ ft and background gas of 157 units. A typical sample to this point was; DOLOSTONE: Light brown, tan, microcrystalline, pyrite, massive, argillaceous, trace arenaceous, trace ﬁne sucrosic, poor to well induration, trace intercrystalline porosity, trace shale, bluish green, trace limestone, wackestone to packstone, cream, soﬂ, chalky, tight, trace dark brown oil staining, faint spotty yellow ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy cut. When we got to 10,042 MD' the decision was to stop drilling because we were not getting build rates to land in the desired pay zone. The plan is to cement back and set a whipstock for ST #3 </p>

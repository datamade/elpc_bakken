The top of the Mission Canyon was picked oﬁ‘ an increase in penetration rates as well as comparisons to the offsetting wells porosity benches throughout the Mission Canyon. Penetration rates throughout the majority of the Mission Canyon averaged around 40 - 50 ﬁ/hr with increases up to 60 ﬁ/hr seen throughout the different porosity benches. The samples throughout the upper 100' of the formation exhibited primarily a gray brown/gray tan limestone with trace to moderate anhydrite present and occasional dolomite mixed in. The remainder of the formation exhibited primarily limestone with trace amounts of cream to off—white anhydrite present. Background gases averaged around 60 — 100 units. The decision was made to TOOH due to slow penetration rates at 10,056’ MD. TOOH, changed out the BHA and tripped back in the hole. The Mission Canyon formation was evaluated while drilling ahead. </p>

The Lodgepole formation was picked at the base of the lower Mission Canyon porosity as well as a sample change from a cream gray tan limestone to a cream gray/light to medium gray limestone. Penetration rates throughout the fomlation down to KOP averaged around 70 - 80 ft/hr with backgrOund gases averaging around 95 — 112 units. KOP was reached at 12:40 pm.

An 8 3/4” Hughes bit and 2.38 degree ﬁxed mud motor were used to build the curve. The landing target for the Skedsvold #21-4-5H at the beginning of the curve was set at 10,945’ @ 90 deg. based off the Lodgepole top and the ﬁrst two LP markers. The Skedsvold # 150-101-4B-9-1H and the Stallion 33-28-1H were used for correlation purposes through the curve. Penetration rates at the beginning of the curve averaged around 70 - 80 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases through the Lodgepole formation averaged around 62 — 150 units. The lithology of the Lodgepole exhibited primarily a cream gray tan/light to medium gray limestone with occasional anhydrite and shale present. Gamma markers began to show that the lower portion of the Lodgepole had thickened slightly. After seeing this, the TVD landing target was lowered to a TVD of 10,949’. The remainder of the Lodgepole formation was drilled out and the False Bakken was encountered. <br/>False Bakken 11,045' MD 10, 909 ’ TVD -8, 628’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 11,045’, true vertical depth of 10,909’, four feet high to prognosis.

    <p class="styleSans564.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>False Bakken 10,649 ’IWD 10,518’ T VD 8,319’ SS <br/>The False Bakken came in ﬁfty eight feet lower than prognosis at 10,649’ MD, 10,518’ TVD. The False Bakken was picked by the large spike in gamma at the base of the Lodgepole. Samples of limestone became much darker and argillaceous in this zone. Upon reaching the False Bakken we knew the rough thicknesses of each formation before reaching our Middle Bakken target, thus we kept our landing target to 10,560’ TVD. <br/>Scallion 10, 659’ MD 10,522’ TVD 8,323 ’ SS <br/>The Scallion was reached at 10,659’ MD, 10,522’ TVD. With the depth that the False Bakken came in, the Scallion came in as expected as far as the formation top was concerned. Samples were medium dark gray limestone, microcrystalline, and slightly carbonaceous, blue ﬂuorescence, instant streaming thick yellow cut. Gas reached an excess of 28 16 units. <br/>Upper Bakken 10,682’MD 10,532’ TVD 8,333’SS <br/>The Upper Bakken was entered at 10,532’ TVD. Upon entering the Upper Bakken shale gas raised in excess of 2833 total units. Background gas was consistently from 1200 to 2000 units in the package. A typical sample was shale, black, very dark gray, gray, dark brown, brown, ﬁrm to brittle, ﬁssile, massive, carbonaceous, waxy, earthy, scattered bright yellow ﬂuorescence, milky yellow cut. The Upper Bakken shale was eighteen feet thick. <br/>Middle Bakken 10, 753 ’ [MD 10, 550’ TVD 8,351 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was entered at 10,550’ TVD. The Middle Bakken in this area is about forty two feet thick and consists of a silty sandstone which is medium to dark gray, light gray, brown in part, platy, granular, ﬁrm to soft, subangular, moderately argillaceous, medium induration, limestone cementation, dolomitic, trace micrite, sucrosic on edges, samples had bright yellow ﬂuorescence, and instant milky streaming yellow cut. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The Tarpon Federal 44-19-1RH reached a total measured depth of 20,447’ MD on November 10, 2014, at 12:00 AM CDT. Formation dip began downward ranging 89.5 to 89.77 degrees coming right out of the lateral casing shoe to 9006 degrees at 14,900’ MD. From 16,000’ MD to 18,000’ MD, the formation continued upward averaging an approximate 90.2 degree dip. From 18,000’ MD until TD formation came down ranging from 89.9 to 89.5 degrees. The best porosity and oil shows came immediately below the clean gamma marker (B-C contact) at the center of the target window. Yellow green to green brown oil was often present on the shakers while in this zone, gas was also elevated </p>

The following assurances apply: 1. The well is equipped with new 32# 7" casing from surface to 11011.9 MD with an API burst rating of 11640 psi 2. The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.80* API burst rating to determine the max pressure 3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment 4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during the flow back than during the frac 5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates 6. Productin equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases ﬂowing 7. A 300# gauge will be installed on surface casing during flowback period <br/>                                                 <br/>  <br/>         <br/>Company Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Company LP FOR STATE USE ONLY TX / r ‘ Lil.

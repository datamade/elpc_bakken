    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Dolomite: Tan, light brown, light tan, ﬁrm, microcrystalline, microsucrosic, moderate induration, carbonaceous, shale: 35% light green-gray, light gray, gray, platy in part, trace pyrite, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming weak cloudy cut. <br/>,000 MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.52 min/ﬂ. The background gases averaged 372 units with a max of 746 units. Entered the Internal 1 at 15,7 53' MD, 11,120.46' TVD showing an estimated dip of 90.4 degrees Next re-entered the target window at 16,278' MD, 11,111.28' TVD showing an estimated dip of 91 degrees. The plan was to drill ahead with a projected estimated dip of 90.4 degrees. <br/>From 17,000' MD to 19,000’ MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.60 min/ft. The background gases averaged 401 units with a max of 1714 units. The bit went out the top of the target window at 17,675' MD 11,099.9' TVD showing an estimated dip of 90.15 degrees. Then the target window was re-entered at 18,400’ MD, 11,101.28’ TVD showing an estimated dip of 89.9 degrees. The plan was to continue drilling ahead at an estimated dip of 90.2 degrees. Due to slow ROP the decision was made to trip out of the hole at 18,630’ MD on September 9, 2014, around 11:00 AM. Reached bottom and resumed drilling ahead on September 10, 2014 around 5:00 AM. While circulating trip gas a 5‘ to 15' foot ﬂare was seen. A max trip gas of 1939 units was seen. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">From 19,000’ MD to 21,059’ MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.65 min/ﬂ. The background gases averaged 326 units with a max of 1270 units. They continued to drill ahead at an overall dip of 90. 15 degrees. The samples remained unchanged and consisted of Dolomite: Tan, light brown, light tan, cream, ﬁrm, microcrystalline, microsucrosic, sandy, moderate induration, carbonaceous, trace pyrite, fair intercrystalline porosity, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming weak cloudy cut. <br/>The TD of the well was reached at 21,059' MD around 7:15 AM CST on September 11, 2014. <br/>Conclusion <br/>Overall the well had poor to fair gas and oil shows. In the Three Forks formation the average ROP was around 0.5 min/ﬂ. Lateral #1 ﬁnished with 79.03% of the wellbore being in the Three Forks target. The wellbore was estimated to be around 14.33% being in the out the top of the Three Forks target window. The wellbore was estimated to be around 6.64% being in the Internal 1 below the Three Forks target window. We are very excited to see the results once the well is put into production. </p>

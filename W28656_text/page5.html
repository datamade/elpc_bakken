The Topeka 6—12H1 is a horizontal well targeting the Three Forks Porosity, crossing section 12 and 1. The Topeka 6-12H1 well was spud on August 5*, 2014 and drilling was completed on September 11*, 2014. Lateral #1 was drilled to a TD of 21,059’ MD. The surface location was set at 250' FSL & 2,375’ FWL, with lateral #1 ending coordinates of 230.12' FNL & 2,644.27' FWL, of section 1 and 10,079.88‘ N—S & 269.27' E-W from the surface location. Joseph Magnan, Torn Purdy and Dennis Corwin of Neset Consulting Service, provided mudlogging and geological services beginning on August 8‘”, 2014 in the vertical hole at 9,200’ MD in the Top Charles formation through TD at 21,059’ MD in the Three Forks formation. Noram Gas Detection Services were utilized throughout the vertical, curve, and horizontal part of the well. Thirty and one hundred foot lagged samples were caught, washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Sample quality was poor to good during the well. Oil shows were poor to fair while in zone. </p>

The top of the Charles samples consisted of Anhydrite: White, off-white, blocky, soﬁ, poor intergranular porosity, Salt: 25% Clear, translucent, cloudy white, cloudy in part, Dolomite: 10% Light gray, gray, brown, blocky, soft to ﬁrm, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, poor to moderate induration, slightly calcareous, scattered white mineral ﬂuorescence, no cut. Then the samples changed to various thicknesses of Limestone: Gray, light gray, blocky, soﬁ to ﬁrm in part, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, poor to moderate induration, slightly calcareous, 30% anhydrite: white, off-white, blocky, trace salt, poor intercrystalline porosity, even scattered off-white ﬂuorescence, very slow streaming to a weak cloudy yellow, green cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.69 min/ft and the background gasses averaged 57 umts. <br/>Base of the Last Salt 9,486' MD 9,485 ' TVD -7,115' SS </p>

The Base of the Last Salt samples consisted of Limestone: Brown, light brown, tan, packstone, carbonaceous, ﬁrm, moderate induration, slightly dolomitic, trace anhydrite, poor intergranular porosity, even yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.53 min/ﬂ and the background gas averaged 75 units. </p>

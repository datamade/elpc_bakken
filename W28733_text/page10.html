The Three Forks was determined to be a silty dolomite with varying amounts of a light green to light gray, pyritic shale. Gamma values through the Three Forks ranged from forty—three and one-hundred and thirty API. End of the curve was reached at a measured depth of 10,721' and a true vertical depth of 10,422.69 at 9:30am CT on August 13, 2014, nineteen feet into the Three Forks formation. <br/>North Lateral 10, 721 ’ — 20,299’ MD <br/>Drilling of the lateral section of the well started at 11:30 am on August 15, 2014. Lateral section was drilled in 96.28 drilling hours in one run. First run used a Security MM64D bit During the evaluation of the Three Forks formation dip angles increased from averages fo 90.1 to 90.7 degrees. At this time the wellbore was at an 88 degree inclination resulting in a Three Forks Shale strike at 17,980’ MD and 10,419’ TVD. Directional work had already been performed to compensate for the low inclination so the wellbore was trending upward at the point of the shale strike. Directional was able to perform a slide resulting in a 91 degree inclination allowing the wellbore to reenter the Three Forks Formation at 18,210’ MD and 10,415’ TVD resulting in only 230’ of shale exposure. Aﬁer returning to formation the lateral was drilled to completion at aTotal Depth of 20,299’ MD, which was reached at 4:25 am on August 20, 2014. </p>

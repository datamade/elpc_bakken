Oxy’s acreage that comprises the spacing units (SU) for the State Gresz 2-2635H—l43—98, State Gresz 3-26-35H-l43-98, State Gresz 4-26-35H—143-98 and State Gresz 5-2635H-l43—98 is dedicated to ONEOK. Under terms of the contract, ONEOK is obligated to install the facilities that are required to connect these wells to its gathering system. Oxy provides (on a monthly basis) to ONEOK a drilling, completion and estimated ﬁrst production date for all wells that are scheduled to be drilled in the foreseeable future. In addition, Oxy and ONEOK <br/>have conference calls, usually bi-weekly, to discuss connection status of wells and changes to Oxy’s drilling and completion schedules. <br/>Gathering System <br/>ONEOK’s gathering system in this area is a dynamic system that has multiple compressor stations with common suction lines. Gas produced from this pad will have a primary ﬂow path to ONEOK’S Lodgepole compressor station and secondary ﬂow paths to ONEOK’S Killdeer and Little Knife compressor stations. The actual ﬂow of the gas will be based on compression operating parameters and gathering system pressures. Gas gathered on this part of ONEOK’s gathering system is processed at ONEOK’s Grassland Processing Plant located in Section 36, T146N, R105W, McKenzie County, North Dakota. </p>

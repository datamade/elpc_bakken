    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">At a measured depth of 17,100 feet gamma decreased below 100 api and continued to drop to 68 api. It was determined the wellbore had moved up into the cleanest gamma lobe above the target window. Gamma correlations indicated a dip of 89.59 degrees. The target true vertical depth was adjusted 2 feet to 9,236 feet with a target inclination of 89.5 degrees. It was thought the steeper angle would gradually move the bit down more towards the mid-point of the window. Samples while drilling within the cleanest gamma zone were described as a light gray to cream gray, limey, siltstone. Fiﬁeen to 40 percent cream, hard, sandy packstone limestone was also noted in samples at that time. Background gas increased dramatically ranging between 700 to 2400 units with connection gasses peaking at 6606 units. <br/>The bit dropped back below the cleanest gamma zone at a measured depth of 17,350 feet. As the wellbore moved back down in section gamma correlations indicated the formation dip had steepened to 89.34 degrees. It was not thought this steep dip would hold. At a measured depth of 17,800 feet the target true vertical depth was adjusted from 9242.3 feet to 9245.3 feet. The target inclination remained at 89.5 degrees. <br/>The wellbore began to build on rotation. Dip calculations were done as the bit moved back up in section, ranging between 89.53 to 89.63 degrees. Because the desire was for the bit to move gradually deeper in section no target changes were made. <br/>At a measured depth of 18,000 feet gamma increased over 200 api. This was not anticipated based on the gamma curve seen at a measured depth of 17,000 feet. At that time the bit was approximately 6 feet high to the target line projected out at 89.5 degrees. As the wellbore moved back below this hot zone gamma correlations indicated the dip had steepened to 89.3 degrees. It was decided to decrease the target inclination at a measured depth of 18,500 feet to 89.3 degrees with a target tme vertical depth of 9,252 feet. This would keep the bit from moving up higher in section. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The K. Thorson 159-94—7A-17-2HS was TD’d at measured depth of 19,027 feet on October 22, 2014 at 11:30 am central standard time. The bottom hole location was projected to 19,027 feet measured depth, 9,256.98 feet true vertical depth, 89.7 degree <br/>inclination, 178.0 degree azimuth, at a vertical section of 9,997.81 feet. The total desired vertical section was obtained. <br/>C harissa Ameson Wellsite Geoolgist </p>

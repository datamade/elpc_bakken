Gamma averaged 102 API. Typical samples were: SHALE: Black, dark brown, smooth, blocky, well compacted, platy in part, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, slow broad streaming cut. Curve #1 was unsuccessful built, with bit landing in the Lower Bakken Shale. The decision was made to Sidetrack at 10,3 50’ MD. The Curve #1 reached TD of 11,155’ MD at 10:10 AM MST on October 18, 2014 with a bit projection ofMD 11,155 /[NC 76.70 / AZ 203.80 / TVD 10926.85 / VS 489.16. Plans were then made for sidetrack. <br/>Curve Sidetrack#1 1 0,35 0’ — 11,322’ MD <br/>Once ﬁnished cementing back and Whipstock was set at 10,350’ MD, drilling of the Curve Sidetrack #1 began at 5:40 PM MST on October 23, 2014. An initial landing target of 10,901 ’ TVD was set before curve was started based on Curve #1. Drilling rates in the Lodgepole below Sidetrack ranged from 0.24—13.37 minutes per foot with an average of 0.90 minutes per foot. Gas in the Lodgepole below Sidetrack ranged from 17370 units with average of 39 units. Gamma ranged from 8-56 API with an average of 22 API. Typical samples were: LIMESTONE: Gray, dark gray, light gray, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, fair to good induration, poor to no intergranular porosity, even yellow green ﬂorescence, fair milky cut. Gamma markers throughout the Lodgepole and formation tops of the False Bakken, Upper Bakken Shale, and Middle Bakken were used to correlate with the Britt 151-4-9-1H and Simpson 151-102-5-8-2H Curve #1 showing a landing target around 10,889’ TVD, even with original well prognosis. The Curve Sidetrack #1 reached TD of 11,322’ MD at 10:50 PM MST on October 24, 2014 with a bit projection ofMD 11,323 /[NC 90.00 / AZ 193.50 / TVD 10,899.19 / VS 751.90. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 11,140’ MD 1 0,8 74 ’ T VD -8,552’ SS <br/>The top of the Upper Bakken Shale was picked at 11,140’ MD, 10,874’ TVD picked at same depth as prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and gamma ray. Background gas ranged from 123-2660 units with average showing 777 units. Drilling rates in the Upper Bakken Shale ranged from 0.23—1.25 minutes per foot with an average of 0.51 minutes per foot. Gamma ranged from 111-255 API with an average of 240 API. Typical samples were: SPMLE: Black to dark gray, dark brown black, brittle/friable, compacted, carbonaceous, 10% limestone, light gray to light gray tan, fair oil staining, even yellow green ﬂuorescence, fair milky cut. </p>

At 10,942’ MD the decision was made to trip due to poor build rates on 10/16/14 at 4:30 PM MST. A more aggressive BHA was picked up and Curve #1 was resumed at 5:15 AM on <br/>10/ l 7/ 14. Gamma markers throughout the Lodgepole and formation tops of the False Bakken, Upper Bakken Shale, and Middle Bakken were used to correlate with the Britt 151-4-9—1H showing a landing target around 10,901’ TVD, 2 feet lower from the original well prognosis landing target of 10,889’ TVD. Curve #1 was unsuccessful built, with bit landing in the Lower Bakken Shale. The decision was made to sidetrack at 10,3 50’ MD. The Curve #1 reached TD of11,155’ MD at 10:10 AM MST on October 18, 2014 with a bit projection ofMD 11,155 /[NC 76.70 / AZ 203.80 / TVD 10,926.85 / VS 489.16. </p>

Background gas ranged from 157-2166 units with average showing 687 units. Drilling rates in the Upper Bakken Shale ranged from 0.75—2.83 minutes per foot with an average of 1.26 minutes per foot. Gamma ranged from 125—251 API with an average of 198 API. Typical samples were: SHALE: Black to dark gray, dark brown black, brittle/ﬁiable, compacted, carbonaceous, 10% limestone, light gray to light gray tan, fair oil staining, even yellow green ﬂuorescence, fair milky cut. At 11,044’ MD the decision was made to trip due to adequate build rates on 10/ 17/ 14 at 9:20 AM MST. A standard curve BHA <br/>was picked up and Curve #1 was resumed at 7:45 PM on 10/ 17/14.

Background gas ranged from 17—4596 units with average of 340 units. ROP averaged 0.1.48 minutes per foot with a range from 07—335 minutes per foot. Gamma showed a range of 35—55 API with an average of 45 API. Typical samples were: SANDSTONE: Gray brown to gray, light gray to tan gray, subangular to subrounded, argillaceous, fair sorting, calcareous, dolomitic cementation, fair inter-granular porosity, trace shale, black, ﬁrm to friable, brittle, compacted, carbonaceous, fair brown oil staining, even yellow-green ﬂuorescence, slow broad streaming cut. At 11,076’ MD the decision was made to trip due to poor build rates on 10/ 17/ 14 at 9:45 PM MST. A more aggressive BHA was picked up and Curve #1 was resumed at 7:50 AM on 10/ 18/14. Full slides were performed to try and land Curve #1 in Middle Bakken formation. </p>

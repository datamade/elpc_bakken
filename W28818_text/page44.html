    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">TD of 11,322’ MD at 10:50 PM MST on October 24, 2014 with a bit projection of MD 11,323 /INC 90.00 / AZ 193.50 / TVD 10899.19/VS 751.90. Aﬁer casing was set at 11,317’ MD, the rig moved and Lateral was resumed at a later date. <br/>Lateral #1 11,322’ MD — 20, 700’ MD DRILLING <br/>Drilling of the lateral began at 8:30 AM MST December 8, 2014. The plan for the lateral was to target 11’-15’ below the bottom of the base of the Upper Bakken Shale. Coming out of the shoe, the initial formation dip was projected at ~90.25 degrees and ~183.88 degrees azimuth. From the shoe to 12,500’ MD dip was held at 90.25 degrees while dip calculations were made based off gamma markers in the Middle Bakken formation. At 12,500’ MD Dip was changed to 90.45 degrees while bit tracked below the Ratty gamma marker for the next 500’ MD. At 13,000’ MD Dip was changed to 90.1 degrees while bit tracked from the Ratty and Upper half of the Middle Bakken formation for the next 1,000’ MD. At 14,000’ MD the dip was changed to 9045 degrees for the next 1,500’ of MD alter the bit tracked from the Ratty gamma marker to the Lower half of the Middle Bakken. At 15,500’ MD the dip was changed to 90.3 degrees for the next 2,000’ of MD after gamma markers showed the bit tracking from the Lower half to the Cool gamma marker in the Middle Bakken formation. At 17,500’ MD the dip was changed to 90.4 degrees for the next 1,000’ of MD while the bit tracked from just below the Ratty gamma marker to the Lower half of formation. At 18,413’ MD a trip was preformed to change out BHA on December 12, 2014 at 1:20 AM MST. Once BHA was changed out and bottom was reached 3,000-7,400 units of trip gas were circulated out with a 10-20 foot ﬂare observed. Lateral was resumed at 4:45 PM MST on December 12 2014. At 19,500’ MD the dip was changed to 90.0 degrees for the remainder of the lateral while the bit worked from the Upper to Lower half of the Middle Bakken formation. The Simpson 151-102-5—8—2H Lateral reached a total depth of 20,700’ MD on December 14, 2014 at 7:20 AM MST. Drilling rates in the Middle Bakken formation ranged from 0.05— 13.7 minutes per foot with an average of 0.53 minutes per foot. The bottom hole location was projected at MD 20,700 / INC 89.30 / AZ 179.10 / TVD 10,860.65 / VS 10,094.76. </p>

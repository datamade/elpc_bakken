The gamma ranged between 60 — high 90’s API. The samples in the clean part of the target window consisted of Dolomite: Light brown, tan, light tan, microcrystalline, moderate induration, sandy, ﬁrm, microsucrosic, carbonaceous, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity, trace micro-pyrite, even dull yellow, green ﬂuorescence, fair thin streaming weak cloudy cut. The gamma ranged between high 30’s — high 70’s API. And the samples out the bottom of the target window consisted of Dolomite: Light brown, tan, brown, microcrystalline, moderate induration, soﬁ to ﬁrm, carbonaceous, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity, trace pyrite, Shale: 45% light gray, gray, light green, even dull yellow/green ﬂuorescence, slow streaming weak cloudy cut. The gamma ranged between Mid 80’s — high 110’s API. The bit entered the top of the target window at 12,740' MD. Then the clean part of the window was entered at 12851’ MD, 11172.18’ TVD, the estimated dip was 89.8 degrees projected out at 90 degrees. The average rate of penetration was around 0.51 min/ﬂ and the background gases averaged 261 units with a max of 1210 units, <br/>From 13,000’ MD to 15,000’ MD, the rate of penetration averaged 0.41 min/ﬂ; The background gases averaged 190 units with a max of 1195 units. The bit entered the Internal 1 below the target window at 13,481’ MD, 11175.89’ TVD until 13961’ MD, showing a dip change from 90.39 degrees to 90.23 degrees. The dip was projected out at 90 degrees in anticipation of a down dip. Next the bit re—entered the Internal 1 at 14,604’ MD showing an estimated dip of 90.27 degrees. <br/>From 15000 MD to 17,000 MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.46 min/ﬂ. The background gases averaged 414 units with a max of 1374 units. The well bore had reentered the target window at 15,038’ MD, 11167.07’ TVD showing an increase of dip to 90.51 degrees. The formation was projected out at 90.3 degrees. Next the top of the clean marker was seen at 15,466’ MD, 11180.57’ TVD then due to a deﬂection the bit went out the top of the target window from 15,990’ MD to 16,3 70’ MD. Then the well bore reentered the clean at 16,674’ MD, 11164.4’ TVD, showing an overall dip of 89.6 degrees. </p>

The curve section was landed in the Middle Bakken at an 84.50O angle at 9,689' MD/9,364.54’ TVD on November 7, 2014 at 8:00 PM CST. The ﬁnal curve TD depth of 9,689’ MD was conﬁrmed when the bottoms up sample at this depth contained light bluish gray Middle Bakken dolomite with trace amounts of very dark brown/ gray to dull black shale slough off. <br/>Horizontal Section <br/>After the intermediate casing shoe was set to 9,689’ MD, drilling began in the horizontal section at 6:30 AM CST on November 9, 2014. The Middle Bakken top was ofﬁcially determined at 9,665’ MD/—7,458’ SS from a decrease in gamma values as the gamma tool transitioned from the UBS into the Middle Bakken dolomite. The curve was generally leveled off within the drilling window at a ~90° angle near measured depth of 10,000’ MD, and the GR Marker was ﬁrst encountered at 9,769” MD/—7,47l’ SS. The formation dip angle from 9,600’ — 10,700’ MD averaged 90.3 degrees, and from 10,700’ - 11,900’ averaged slightly greater than 90 degrees. The formation dip angle from 1 1,900’ — 15,000’ then angled up again at an average of 90.2 degrees, and then ﬂattened out from 15,000’ MD to TD of 16,090’ MD with a dip angle of 90 to 90.1 degrees. <br/>Middle Bakken 9,665 ’ MD 9,362 ’ TVD -7,458 ’ SS GR Marker 9, 769’ MD 9,3 75 ’ TVD -7,47I ’ SS <br/>The ﬁrst section of the horizontal for Parshall 26-3029H was drilled from the landing target window of 9,375 — 9385’ TVD set at 9,700’ MD, to Way Point 1, set at 1 1,000’ MD, with a target window of 9,370 — 9,380’ TVD. Within Way Point 1, the GR Marker was encountered for the second time at 10,847’ MD/—7,465’ SS. The second section of the horizontal was drilled to Way Point 2, set at 13,000’ MD, with a target window of 9,365 — 9,375’ TVD. Within Way Point 2, the GR Marker was encountered for the third time at 1 1,843’ MD/-7,465’ SS. Between the landing target and Way Point 1, drilling involved sliding to make an azimuth turn from approximately 113 degrees to approximately 135 degrees, which was accomplished near 10,950’ MD. </p>

The fourth section of the horizontal was drilled to Way Point 4, set at 15,200’ MD, with a target window of 9,360 — 9,370’ TVD. Within Way Point 4, the GR Marker was encountered for the ﬁfth and ﬁnal time at 14,990’ MD/-7,455’ SS The ﬁfth and ﬁnal horizontal section of Parshall 26-3029H was set to Way Point STD at 16,212’ MD, with a target window of 9,357 — 9,373’ TVD. TD was reached within Way Point STD at 16,090’ MD. All Way Points were published by Tony Rios of EOG Resources. </p>

OPNA intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pro-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used In the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing ls cemented, a plug or mechanical seat will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accOrdance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDACI is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an Initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth butts not Intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. OPNA understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding conﬁdentiality pertaining to this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately, as site conditions allow, after construction if the well pad Is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-0349 8. 19.1). OPNA will <br/>notify the NDIC and work on an alternative solution if unforeseen circumstances prevent the rig from returning to drill prior to the 90 extension expiration. <br/> (le .5 <br/>Company Telephone Number Oasis Petroleum North America LLC (281) 404-9652 Address <br/>1001 Fannin, Suite 1500 <br/>City Zip Code <br/>Houston TX 77002 e ‘ ‘ ' Victoria Siemlenlewskt <br/>Title Date <br/>Re ulato S - eclalist Februa 18, 2015 <br/>Email Address <br/>vslemlenlewskiﬁfoasls - etroleum.com <br/>33 <br/>                            <br/>a Notice of Intent <br/>E] Drilling Prognosis Spill Report <br/>   <br/>D Redrilling or Repair Shooting <br/>E] Plug Well Fracture Treatment <br/>E] U E] Casing or Liner [J Acidlzing [II III <br/>E] Supplemean History Change Production Method [3 Temporarily Abandon Reclamation <br/>Z Other Suspension of Drilling <br/>    <br/>24-HOUR PRODUCTION RATE <br/>Below Oil -I- Bbls <br/>Oil Bbls Water Bbls Water Bbls Gas MCF Gas MCF <br/>      <br/>     <br/>                                                                                                      <br/>  <br/>         <br/>   <br/>MD I!

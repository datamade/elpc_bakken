The samples changed to Shale: Black, dark brown, blocky, ﬁssile, gritty to smooth, argillaceous, ﬁrm to hard, brittle, no porosity, no ﬂuorescence, instant fair streaming cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 1.04 min/ﬂ and background gas was around 640 units, with a max of 955 units. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,124 ' MD 10,949’ T VD -8,520' SS <br/>The Middle Bakken zone was next seen. The Middle Bakken was picked based on gamma and sample changes. This formation consisted of Limestone: Gray, light gray, cream-gray, brown, light brown, tan, soft to ﬁrm, silty, microcrystalline, argillaceous, slightly dolomitic, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity; even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 1.97 min/ﬂ and background gas was around 291 units with a max of 468 units. The TD of the curve was reached at 11,310' MD on September 28, 2014 around 5:45 AM., CST. The 7” Inch Casing was set at 11,290’ MD, 10,966.48' TVD, about 17’ feet below the top of the Middle Bakken. The target zone in the Middle Bakken ranged between 13’ and 23’ feet below the Upper Bakken Shale. </p>

The Mission Canyon was picked ﬁ‘om rate of penetration, and sample changes. The formation consisted of Limestone: Brown, light brown, tan, blocky, packstone, carbonaceous, ﬁrm, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow/ green ﬂuorescence, faint thin streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.72 min/ﬂ and the backgron gases averaged 182 units. <br/>Lodgepole 10,215'MD 10,214' TVD -7, 785'SS <br/>The Lodgepole was observed next. The Lodgepole was picked based on sample, gamma, and rate of penetration changes. The samples consisted of Limestone: Light gray to gray brown, brown, light brown, tan, ﬁrm to brittle, packstone, carbonaceous, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow, green ﬂuorescence, slow streaming to a weak cloudy yellow, green cut. The kick-off point was reached at 10,509' MD on September 26, 2014 around 8:00 AM., CST. Reached bottom and began drilling the curve September 27, 2014 around 6:00 AM CST. The landing target was set at 10,965’ TVD, 20’ feet into the Middle Bakken. The landing target was adjusted to 10,967 ’ TVD alter seeing the false Bakken marker, The rate of penetration averaged 1.04 min/ﬂ. and background gas averaged around 134 units. </p>

Exact time of test start and test end will be adjusted to yield true 24 hour tests Each well’s downtime will be monitored to determining actual producing time for each well Daily production per well is calculated as follows: i. For Oil— Daily calculated volume equals well test oil rate times producing hours during each day ii. For Water- Daily calculated volume equals well test water rate times producing hours during each day iii. For Gas- Daily calculated volume equals established well GOR times daily calculated oil volume The daily calculated volume from each well is totaled for all wells to determine the calculated total daily volume, and a correction factor is determined by dividing the actual total daily volume by the calculated total daily volume. Each well’s allocated daily production is calculated by multiplying its individual daily calculated oil, water and gas volumes by the correction factor. </p>

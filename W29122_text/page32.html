Field gas is gathered and transported through the system to OneOK’s Garden Creek plant (Sec. 35-151N-98W) for processing. The system has interconnections to allow offloading excess gas volumes to Hess’ Tioga plant (Sec. 26-157N95W) and to Hiland Partners’ Watford City Plant (Sec. 6-151N-102W). <br/>See attached plats. <br/>Gathering Segment Name: Blue Buttes compressor <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>3a. Maximum Current Capacity of Gathering Segment: 35 000 MCFD <br/>3b. Current Throughput of Gathering Segment: 13 000 MMCFD <br/>3c. Anticipated Capacity of Gathering Segment At lP Date: 35 000 MMCFD <br/>3d. Anticipated Throughput of Gathering Segment At IP Date: 28,120 MCFD (including these wells) <br/>3e. issues or Expansion Plans: OneOK plans for added capacity in this area via the Galaxy compressor station with 50MMCFD (Q3 2015) and another TBD compressor station with 50 MMCFD ((11 2016) capacity. Exact locations ofthese new compressors are subject to change. <br/>Flowback Strategy <br/>4a. First production is expected 2/7/15, Gas sales connection is expected by 1/24/15 <br/>4b. Anticipated oil and gas rates: IP 1347 BOPD, 1885 MCFD <br/>Amount of Gas Applicant is Currently Flaring <br/>5a. 5b. <br/>Statewide percentage of gas flared: 11.31% (5/2014) Fieldwide percentage of gas flared: Dimmick Lake, 0% (5/2014) </p>

Installation of a liquid stripping plant to be utilized in the event of upset conditions would not be economic. Such an installation will be reevaluated as additional wells are completed and if conditions change. <br/>A natural gas powered generator could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 30—40 MCFD. A liquid stripping plant could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 40%. On lease gas use by Heater/Treaters will consume approximately 15 MCFD </p>

At this time we cannot provide you a physical address for the requested location, however, the permit number (NDIC code) assigned to your project will serve as the as the primary identifier for addressing and emergency purposes. <br/>According to North Dakota Century Code § 57—40640 (1 .d) the County is the authorizing entity for assignment of rural addressing in conformance with the modified Burkle addressing plan. When 911 addressing of a well site is not possible, the North Dakota 9-1-1 Association supports use of the NDIC code as the primary piece of information for locating a well site. <br/>If you have questions or concerns please don't hesitate to contact my office and I will do whatever I can to assist your company. <br/>Sincerely, <br/>z” X; Katie Lima Building Official <br/>Development Services Building Division <br/>Development Services — Building Division PO Box2047 | 2202ndAve. E. i WIIIiston,ND58802-2047 I Phone 701.577.4567 | www.williamsnd.com </p>

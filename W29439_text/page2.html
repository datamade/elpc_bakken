    <p class="styleSans791.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Curve Section: 9, 090' —- 10,014. 00' MD (ICP set at 10,004 MD) <br/>  <br/>The kick-off-point of 9,090’ MD was reached at 5:50 am. CST on Monday, November 10, 2014. Drilling/sliding operations, to build the curve, began at 9,090’ MD at 5:50 am. CST on Monday, November 10, 2014, as we had tripped 40 feet before the K.O.P. in order to pick up the curve tools early. The end of the curve was reached at a measured depth (MD) of 10,014.00’and a true vertical depth (TVD) of 9,662.84’ at 6:05 am. CST on Wednesday, November 12, 2014, just under twenty—nine feet into the Three Forks formation, or approximately one feet above our, adjusted, landing target of 9,664’ TVD (an estimated 30 feet into the formation). The curve was completed with one bit and one motor, using only one run in forty—eight hours and ﬁfteen minutes (48: 15). <br/>False Bakken 9,590’ 1WD 9,518’ TVD -7,125’ SS <br/>The False Bakken Formation was encountered at 9,590’ MD / 9,518’ TVD. The False Bakken Formation was not listed on the prognosis, but came in 5’ low as compared to the Johan Stephen 13-24H. The False Bakken was picked off of a conspicuous peak in Gamma accompanied by a drilling break that saw a sharp ROP decrease from 2.8 minutes per foot up to 3.4 minutes per foot at the False Bakken Formation top, followed by an increase to 2.3 minutes per foot after entering the formation. The Gamma showed a commonly observed peak in the vicinity of the formation change which shows the Gamma to increase from 28.0 to 99.8 API units before falling off again to a value of 30.9 API units inside the formation. Gas shows were poor with average gas values of 175 units with a high of 245 units of total gas. Oil shows were poor, with an even dark violet ﬂuorescence with a faint very weak hazy blooming light pale violet cut being noted. Average penetration rates through the False Bakken Formation were observed to be 2.85 minutes per foot. <br/>Upper Bakken 9,605’MD 9,529’ TVD -7,136’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Formation was encountered at 9,605’ MD / 9,529’ TVD which was 9’ high as compared to the prognosis and 6’ low as compared to the Johan Stephen 13—24H. The Upper Bakken Shale Formation was picked by the sharp increase in Gamma that is widely known to occur with entrance into the unit. The increase in Gamma API unit values in the vicinity of the top of the Upper Bakken Shale was observed to be from 28.6 to 408.1. In addition to the Gamma spike a spike in ROP was also observed, as is expected, upon entering the Upper Bakken Shale. The ROP increased from 5.6 minutes per foot, to 0.8 minutes per foot and then slowed back to 1.0 to 2.3 minutes per foot before leaving the formation. The Upper Bakken Formation lithology was expressed as a black, waxy, smooth, hard, angular, and carbonaceous Shale. Gas readings in the Upper Bakken Shale were considered to be poor to fair, averaging 306 units with a high value of 569 total gas units. Average penetration rates through the Upper Bakken Shale were observed to be 1.44 minutes per foot. Hydrocarbon shows were noted as bright blooming milky blue-white cuts. Only even dark violet ﬂuorescence was observed. </p>

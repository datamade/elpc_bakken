The Charles Middle Salt Stringer was picked off of a change in ROP that showed an increase from 1.9 to 0.5 minutes per foot at the Charles Middle Salt Stringer. The lithology, at the stringer, exhibited a change ﬁom a sample that was described as being 45% Limestone, 30% Anhydrite, 20% Salt, and 5% Siltstone to one that was noted as being 45% Limestone with 30% Salt, and 25% Anhydrite. Gas shows at the Charles Middle Salt Stringer were determined to be poor showing only 84 units of total gas at the stringer. <br/>Charles Lower Salt Stringer 7,882’ 1WD 7,881 TVD -5, 488’ SS <br/>The Charles Lower Salt Stringer was encountered at 7,882” MD / 7,881’ TVD which was 16’ high as compared to the prognosis and 1’ low as compared to the Johan Stephen 13-24H. The Charles Lower Salt Stringer was picked off of a change in ROP that showed a slight decrease ﬁom 1.0 to 1.2 minutes per foot at the stringer. The lithology at the stringer was described as containing 90% Limestone, 5% Salt and 5% Anhydrite. Gas shows at the Charles Lower Salt Stringer were determined to be poor showing only 94 units of total gas. <br/>Madison/Radcliffe 8,002 ’ MD 8,001 ’ TVD -5, 608 ’ SS <br/>The Madison/Radcliffe was encountered at 8,002’ MD / 8,001 ’ TVD which was 70’ high as compared to the prognosis and 1’ low as compared to the Johan Stephen 13-24H. The Madison/Radcliffe was picked off of a drop in ROP from 2.3 minutes per foot to 3.0 minutes per foot at the top of the formation. The lithology at the transition exhibited a change from a 95% cream, off-white, pasty, soft, and gummy Anhydrite with 5% light to dark gray, microcrystalline Limestone to one that was noted to consist of 95% gray, gray-tan, tan, light beige, cream, and light gray, Dolomitic Limestone with 5% off-white, white, tan, and cream, soﬁ, gummy, and pasty Anhydrite. Gas shows ﬁom the Madison/Radcliffe to the Base of the Last Salt were determined to be poor averaging only 88 units with a high value of 100 units of total gas. Average penetration rates ﬁom the Madison/Radcliffe to the Base of the Last Salt were observed to be 122 minutes per foot. Oil shows ﬁom the Madison/Radcliffe to the Base of the Last Salt were mixed with weak hazy blooming to cloudy cuts being described. </p>

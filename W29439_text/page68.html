    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Murex Petroleum Corporation Sherry Ann 13-24H is a grass-roots horizontal well intended for oil and gas production in the Three Forks Formation, within the Temple Field, located in eastern Williams County, North Dakota. The Sherry Ann 13-24H is the second well of a two well pad. The ﬁrst well, the Johan Stephen 13—24H, was drilled in the Middle Bakken Formation during October of 2014. <br/>The well is located in Section thirteen, Township one-hundred, ﬁfty-eight north, and a Range of ninety-six west, (NE/NE). The bottom hole coordinates of the Murex Petroleum Corporation Sherry Ann 13-24H are 208.91’ from the south line and 1,155.76’ from the east line within Section twenty-four, Township one hundred, ﬁfty-eight north, and a Range of ninety-six west, (SE/SE). <br/>The Murex Petroleum Corporation Sherry Ann l3-24H well spudded on Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:30 pm. CDT and reached a total depth of 19,678.00‘ MD on Wednesday, November 19, 2014 at 10:41 am. CST, eighteen days from spud. Well-site Geological services were started at 10:00 pm. CST on Thursday, November 6, 2014, at a measured depth of 7,250’, within the Spearﬁsh Formation. Thirty-foot, and ten-foot, lagged samples were caught, cleaned, tested, analyzed, catalogued and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey in Grand Forks, North Dakota and at Murex Petroleum Corporation in Houston, Texas. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">A thirteen and one half inch Smith Tricone bit was used to spud the well, and was used to drill ﬁom a surface depth of 103 feet to 2003.00 feet using ﬁesh water. The mud system was displaced from freshwater to invert mud at 2,003 feet MD. The mud system was observed by Rick Bemis and Chris Mooren of MI Swaco. Surface Casing was set at 2,003.00' MD. F orty—nine joints of 9 5/8” 36# J—55 LT&C Surface Casing were applied to the Murex Petroleum Corporation Sherry Ann 13-24H on Monday, November 3, 2014 at 6:30 pm. CST. Two - eight and three quarter inch bits were used to drill the vertical and build the curve using oil-based mud. The second 8 3A” bit, a Smith MDSiS 16, was picked up at 9,050’ MD forty feet before completing the vertical leg and reaching the Kick-Off Point of 9,090’ MD. The K.0.P. of 9,090’ MD was reached at 5:50 am. CST, on Monday, November 10, 2014. Building of the curve commenced at that point and at that time. The End of Curve (EOC), or Intermediate Casing Point (ICP), was reached on Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 6:05 am. CST at a depth of 10,014’ MD/ 9,662.84’ TVD and was completed with one bit and motor taking only one run. 125 joints of 29 # HCL-80: 7” and 119 joints of 32# HCL-8027” intermediate casing were set to 10,004’ MD at 9:30 am. CST on Thursday, November 13, 2014. Drilling the lateral began at 1:35 pm. on Friday, November 14, 2014. The lateral leg was completed at 10:05 am. on Wednesday, November 19, 2014 in two runs using two motors, two bits and two gamma tools. Oil-based drilling ﬂuid was used to drill the vertical section, curve sections. A brine-based drilling ﬂuid was used for drilling the lateral section of the well. Gas monitoring equipment was provided by Pason Gas System and was used for all sections of the Murex Petroleum Corporation Sherry Ann 13-24H well. </p>

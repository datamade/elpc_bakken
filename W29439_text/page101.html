The Base of the Last Salt was picked off of a drilling break that saw ROP decrease from 0.4 minutes per foot to 1.9 minutes per foot and then increase back to 1.6 minutes per foot soon aﬁer crossing the marker. The lithology at the marker exhibited a change from a sample of 90% Salt, with 10% Limestone to one that was observed to be 60% Anhydrite with 40% Limestone. Gas shows of the Base of the Last Salt were determined to be poor with a value of only 87 units of total gas at the marker. Gas values from the Base of the Last Salt to the F robisher—Alida averaged 110 units with a high value of 245 units of total gas. ROP rates from the Base of the Last Salt to the F robisherAlida averaged 2.3 minutes per foot. Oil shows from the Base of the Last Salt marker to the <br/>Frobisher—Alida were varied with mostly hazy blooming cuts with some cloudy and streaming cuts being described lower in the interval. <br/>Frobisher- Alida 8,251 ’ MD 8,250’ TVD -5,85 7’ SS </p>

The Frobisher—Alida Formation was picked off of a slight change in drilling rates that saw ROP drop from 6.0 minutes per foot to 7.2 minutes per foot at the formation top and then increase back to 5.2 minutes per foot shortly after dropping into the formation and continued to ﬂuctuate aﬁer that. The lithology at the transition exhibited no change from a Limestone (100%) that was described as being brown, light brown, dark brown, tan, gray, light gray, and gray-tan at the top of the Frobisher-Alida Formation. Gas shows from the F robisher—Alida Formation to the top of the Lodgepole formation averaged only 136 units of total gas with a high value of 249 units. Average penetration rates from the Frobisher—Alida Formation to the top of the Lodgepole Formation were observed to be 1.53 minutes per foot. Oil shows of the Frobisher—Alida Formation were generally fair, though widely varied, changing from weak hazy to cloudy blooming and streaming cuts lower in the formation. <br/>Lodgepole 8, 993’ MD 8,992’ TVD -6, 599’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation was encountered at 8,993’ MD / 8,992’ TVD which was 15’ high as compared to the prognosis and 5’ low as compared to the Johan Stephen 13-24H. The Lodgepole Formation was picked off of a slight ROP change that saw an increase from 3.5 minutes per foot to 2.0 minutes per foot at the formation top. The lithology at the transition exhibited a change from a Dolomitic Limestone (100%) that was described as gray, light gray, gray-tan, cream, beige, and light brown to a Dolomitic Limestone that was described as gray-tan, light gray, gray-brown, light brown, beige, and off-white. Gas shows of the Lodgepole were determined to be poor averaging only 104 units with a high value of 174 units of total gas. Average penetration rates through the Lodgepole Formation were observed to be 2.22 minutes per foot. Oil shows of the Lodgepole Formation were observed to be fair to good, and greatly varied, with many hazy, cloudy blooming and streaming cuts being noted. </p>

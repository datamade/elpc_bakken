The well bore would be drilled northward, traversing two geographical section in T154N - R102W: Section 10 and Section 3. The Middle Bakken Member was 50’ thick at location. <br/>Lithologically, the Middle Bakken was expected to consist of dolomitic siltstone. <br/>Structurally, the formation was expected to ascend, rising 132’ over the course of the well bore, with an average inclination of 90.7 degrees. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Operation <br/>On 11/30/14 we began building the curve from a KOP of 8851’. The curve was completed on 12/ 1/ 14, at a measured depth of 9581’. The casing was set at 9531’ MD, approximately 31’ down from the Middle Bakken Top. <br/>We commenced the lateral on 12/3/14. Drilling ahead, gamma values were encountered which indicated a proximity to shale. A bottom up was circulated, and some Bakken shale was present in the cuttings. Calculating a probable scrape with the Upper Bakken Shale, we slid down and drilled to 15748’ in an unsuccessful attempt to achieve departure from the shale. <br/>Tripping back to 15110’, we began sidetracking by time drilling and sliding down. At 15138’ the formation structural interpretation was reassessed. It was determined that we had encountered the Lower Bakken Shale at 15646’. <br/>Pulling back to 13379’, we sidetracked again to move up away from the Lower Bakken Shale. The remainder of the well bore was placed in the Middle Bakken. <br/>Lithologically, the Middle Bakken consisted of siltstone. The rock was cream, light brown, and light gray in color. The siltstone was dolomitic, and showed tight to poor intergranular porosity. Pyrite was present in trace amounts. <br/>Gas shows were poor. Total gas values averaged around 300 units. <br/>Cuts were very slow blue-white cuts. A trace of yellow-green oil was present on the possum belly after a trip at 18163’. There were otherwise no oil shows. <br/>Snucturally, the Middle Bakken ascended. The formation rose 95’ out to the Lower Bakken entry point at 15 646’, showing an inclination of 90.9 degrees. No depth markers were encountered after the 13379’ sidetrack with which to determine dip. <br/>We TD’d the well on 12/15/14, with a total depth drilled of 19178’. 9531’ ofhole was emplaced beyond the casing. </p>

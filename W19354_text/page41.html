Per NDIC Order #14521, Hess will drill this well as part of a 3-well pad. Hess intends to drill the surface hole portions of all 3 wells consecutively using a small surface casing rig, with casing set at the pre-approved depth as listed on the APD and temporarily plugged to prevent foreign matter from entering the wellbore. Per NDAC 43-02-0321 the surface interval will be drilled using freshwater based drilling mud. Hess anticipates that the surface interval of each well will take approximately 3-5 days to drill. Within 90 days of setting surface casing on all three wells, Hess will move a larger drilling rig onto location to consecutively drill all three wells to TD as per the drilling plans included on the APDs. If the drilling rig does not arrive on the pad within the 90 days Hess will plug and abandon the wells and reclaim the well site. The three wells are planned as stacked dual lateral wells. This well will be the third well to be drilled to TD. Under NDAC 43-02-03-19, 19.1, any lined reserve pits will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture. Under NDAC 43-02-03-31, Hess understands that if confidentiality is requested on the APD the six months of confidentiality will begin on the date the well is spudded, regardless of any commencement of drilling operations after that date. <br/>      <br/>                    <br/>          <br/>           <br/>  <br/>  <br/>Company Telephone Number Hess Cor oration 701-420-6900 FOR STATE use ONLY <br/>Signature Printed Name W Lindse Doubek <br/>Title Date <br/>Technician Jul 6,2010 <br/>Email Address ldoubek hess.com <br/>    <br/>Itiineral Resources Permit Manag r <br/>  </p>

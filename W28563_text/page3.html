The initial phase is a vertical and curve, landing 20 feet into the Three Forks Formation. The Bailey 6—24H1 spudded on October 1, 2014 and reached a total depth of 21,600’ MD on November 22, 2014. <br/>Wellsite geological services began at 8,900 feet in the Charles Formation at 3:55 am CT on October 4, 2014. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected during the straight hole and curve while one hundred foot lagged samples were caught during the lateral. All samples were saved and boxed to be sent to the State of North Dakota. <br/>Base of the Last Salt 9,1 5 7’ MD 9,153 ’ TVD -6, 880’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered at 9,153’ TVD and 6,880’ SS. The Base of the Last Salt was picked by the last sample with salt present, an ROP change, and gamma. The Base Last Salt came in with prognosis. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,373 ’ MD 9,369’ TVD -7,096’ SS <br/>The top of the Mission Canyon was picked off of the gamma marker and sample change, along with differential pressure. Drill rates in the Mission Canyon averaged 1.12 minutes per foot with gas only 8-11 units. Typical samples were gray to dark gray limestone, wackestone, argillaceous, poorly indurated, soﬂ; to ﬁrm, no to poor intergranular porosity. Cuts and ﬂuorescence shows were sporadic and questionable due to the oil-based mud. The Mission Canyon came in 1’ low to prognosis. <br/>Lodgepole 9,934 ’ MD 9,930.34 ’ TVD -7,65 7.34 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Lodgepole was picked off of the gamma marker and sample change, along with differential pressure. Drill rates in the Lodgepole above KOP averaged 1.09 minutes per foot with gas 6-11 units. Typical samples were gray to dark gray LIMESTONE: Gray to light gray, medium to light brown, creamy brown to tan, ﬁrm slightly to moderately calcareous, no to poor porosity. Cuts and ﬂuorescence shows were sporadic and questionable due to the oil-based mud. The Lodgepole came in with prognosis. <br/>The kick-off point for the curve was reached at 10,452’ MD at 3:07 pm CT on October 5, 2014. After tripping for curve assembly, drilling resumed at 1:05 am CT on October 6, 2014. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 10,81 7’ MD 10, 771 ’ TVD -8, 49 7’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was picked off sample and gamma change. The average ROP was 0.68 minutes per foot, and gas detection was not functional. A typical sample </p>

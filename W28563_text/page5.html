This trip produced 480 units of gas with no oil shows. At 11,655’ MD the MWD tool failed. After tripping <br/>out to the KOP the tool was wirelined out and replaced. This trip produced 96 units of gas with no oil shows. </p>

Drilling continued with many level changes seen due to bounces from the hard streaks. These bounces, along with correlating gamma markers, gave us control for dip calculations and veriﬁed the trend we had seen on previous well from this pad. These bounces and changes in level were fairly easy to correct for and drilling was maintained in target zone with the bit being 5-6’ below the top when coming to the end of this section. </p>

As the bit came down gas readings stayed up slightly but chromats correlating with gas dropped. This coincided with an increase of lube sweeps which have been shown to increase gas readings. This section showed extremely low gas readings out of casing and throughout this entire section. There were no oil shows observed through this section and water weights were maintained at 9.9 to 10 <br/>pounds.

At approximately 18,250’ MD the bit bounced down and dropped into the lower portion of target zone indicated by the higher gamma. The bit leveled off near the bottom of target zone at approximately 19,000’ MD and drilling continued at or near dip until seeing a bounce up at 20,300’ MD. After coming back up into the cleaner portion of target zone the bit was leveled off. Drilling continued with the bit being rotated out, building on rotation, until reaching a TD of 21,600’ MD at 11:10 am CT on November 22, 2014. Projection to bit showed the well ended approximately 2’ out the top of the target zone.

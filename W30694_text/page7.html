Samples (cuttings, ﬂuids, and/or gases) will be submitted when requested by the Authorized Ofﬁcer, North Dakota Field Ofﬁce, Bureau of Land Management, 99 23 Avenue West, Dickinson, North Dakota 58601-2619, Telephone: 701-227-7700. <br/>ABNORMAL CONDITIONS <br/>No abnormal temperatures or pressures are anticipated. Hydrogen sulﬁde (HZS) may be encountered in the Mission Canyon Formation at a TVD of approximately 8940'. Safety equipment will be in operation at approximately 8440'. <br/>A Hydrogen Sulﬁde (HZS) Contingency Plan is being prepared and will be submitted under separate cover for review and approval. As a safety precaution, the rig sub-structure will remain open during drilling operations to allow natural convection to dissipate any accumulations of hydrogen sulﬁde gas. Should HZS concentrations exceed 20 ppm, a “bug blower” fan will be activated at that position in order to dissipate the concentration of H28 <br/>gas to acceptable levels. <br/>Maximum anticipated bottom hole pressure equals approximately 5729psi (calculated at 0.55 psi/foot at Bakken target depth, 10417’) and maximum anticipated surface pressure equals approximately 3438psi (bottom hole pressure minus the pressure of a partially evacuated hole calculated at 0.22 psi/foot at Bakken target depth). The intermediate design casing will be run and cemented before drilling the target lateral. <br/>Reservoir temperature is anticipated to be 244°F. <br/>ANTICIPATED STARTING DATES AND NOTIFICATION OF OPERATIONS </p>

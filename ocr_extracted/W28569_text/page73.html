The upper section of the Three Forks was logged as a gray green pyritic shale and 10’ to 12’ below the Lower Bakken Shale the gamma cools to values as low as 50 api and lithology changes to tan orange dolomite. Penetration rates decrease from 75 ﬁ/hr to 40 ft/hr while drilling into the Three Forks from the upper shale </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Intermediate casing point was reached at MD 11,521’ on July 4, 2014 at 12:48 PM CDT. The curve was landed at 88 degrees approximately 16 feet below the overlying Lower Bakken Shale. Casing was set at MD 11,506’. <br/>LATERAL #1 MD 11,521’—MD 14,618’ <br/>Drilling resumed for the lateral section of Alexander 26-35 STFH at 1:37 PM CDT on July 17,2014 at MD 11,521 feet. The casing shoe was set at 11,506 feet. Samples cleaned up by the MD 1 1,600 sample. They were logged as typical tan and orange tan dolomite of the Three Forks. This geological summary is based on the last comprehensive inteipretation of the structure. <br/>Initially formation dip was calculated to 89.6 degrees using data from surrounding offsets and basing some on data known from the overlying Bakken Formation. Drilling continued to 14,128 where a shale strike was encountered. This shale strike was at TVD <br/>11,146’. This data calculated an 89.16 degree dip. <br/>Time drilling was utilized to return the well bore to the Three Forks. The well bore ultimately reached one foot into the overlying Lower Bakken Shale. Time diilling was successful in turning the well bore down and re-entering the Three Forks at MD 14,276’. The new target window was reached by the last survey on this well bore at MD <br/>14,559’. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling became problematic and sliding was ineffective, A TOOH was made and paits of the assembly were separated in the hole. At this time the separated assembly was pushed to the bottom of the well bore and the well bore was cemented back for a sidetrack. <br/>LATERAL #2 MD 11,800’ - 21,017’ <br/>Drilling resumed for sidetrack #l at MD 11,800’ on August 5, 2014 at 610 PM CDT. Again, this geological summary is based on the last comprehensive interpretation of the stmcture. <br/>The well bore was brought up into the target window by MD 12,000 feet. Drilling continued moving up section approximately 12,900’where the well bore was fumed over. </p>

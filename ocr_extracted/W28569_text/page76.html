The lower target window has a low gamma marker with values in the 50’s api. <br/>The well bore was turned up att his point and gradually came to the top of the target window where it remained to MD 16,000’. It gradually drilled to the bottom of the window. Most gamma through this drilling was in values from the mid 90’s api to about <br/>110 api. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The well bore exited the target window at MD 16,660. At this point this is the lowest the well bore had been in section. Gamma correlations became increasingly difﬁcult. The well bore drilled beneath the target window for most of the remainder of drilling. High gamma values at MD 18,150’forced a decision to come down section. The well bore was dropped 22 feet of TVD seeing no change in the “hot” gamma. This data revealed the well bore had dropped into the second bench 0f the Three Forks at MD 18,400’. Kathy Neset was consulted at this point and she continued that we had gotten too low. Her opinion was that drilling should continue with the interpretations made based on the last solid dip calculations which was 89.15 degrees. <br/>The well bore was brought back into the upper ﬁrst Three Forks bench at MD 19,400’. It was not brought into the target window until MD 20,800’. It was impossible to obtain the needed data to conﬁrm a final dip. The last dip calculated was changed at MD 18,800 to 89.3 degrees. </p>

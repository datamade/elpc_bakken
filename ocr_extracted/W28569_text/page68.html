No signiﬁcant gas values were logged and averaged 1 18 units through the upper portion of the Madison. The ﬁrst Charles Salt bed was chosen at MD 8,814 where a signiﬁcant amout of salt was logged ﬁ'om sample. Drilling through the salts penetration rates were very steady and averaged 86 ft/hr. Drilling through the limestone and anhydrite beds of the Madison were more erratic, ranging from 20 ft/hr to 50 ft/hr. The Base of the Last Salt was chosen at MD 9,516’/TVD 9,513’. This choice was based chiefly on ROP. </p>

Gas values decreased from values in the 100 units to values around 40 units.ROP ranged from 30 ft/hr to 60 ft/hr. The Frobisher Alida was chosen at MD 9,743’ /TVD 9,740’ and was chosen where dead oil stains were logged in the samples. Penetration rates slowed in the lower Mission Canyon to an average of 25 ft/hr. Gas values increased some in the lower section as well, some values were as high as 250 units. <br/>LODGEPOLE MD 10,354 ’; TVD 10,351’; SS -8,024’ <br/>The Lodge pole was the ﬁrst top where gamma was utilized in identiﬁcation. Lithology changes were typical; changing from tan colored limestone to gray limestone. Penetration rates increased att his lithology change to an average of 40 ft/hr. Gas values decreased in the middle of this section to 50 units. Gas values increased some in the lower Lodgepole, showing values around 250 units. The typical False Bakken gas show was not seen. </p>

It was logged at MD 11.118’/TVD 10,040’. The typical warm up in gamma was seen, along with samples being described as black pyritic shale. The penetration rate while sliding into the Bakken increased to 40 ft/hr from about 30 ft/hr. The Middle Bakken’s typical cool down in gamma was logged dropping from values over 200 api to values mostly in the 80’s and 900’s api. There is a section] 0 feet below the upper shale that cooled into the 30’s api. It is approximately 2.5 feet thick. The Lower Bakken was logged at MD 1 1,283/TVD 1 1,102’. Again the typical gamma marker was logged where the gamma increased to over 200 api. Samples too were typical black shale. Entering the Bakken gas values increased to 7,700 units and averaged 1,800 units throughout the Bakken <br/>Formation. Gas values average 1,100 units. </p>

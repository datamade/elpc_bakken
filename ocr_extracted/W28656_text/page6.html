    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Mission Canyon was next to be drilled. The Mission Canyon was picked from rate of penetration, and sample changes. The formation consisted of Limestone: Brown, light brown, tan, dark brown, blocky, packstone, carbonaceous, ﬁrm, moderate induration, slightly dolomitic, poor intercrystalline porosity, even very dull yellow ﬂuorescence, slow thin streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.61 min/ﬂ and the backgron gases averaged 117 units. <br/>Lodgepole 10,366 ' MD 10,365' T VD - 7,995 ' SS <br/>The Lodgepole was observed next. The Lodgepole was picked based on sample, and rate of penetration changes. The samples consisted of Limestone: Light gray brown, brown, light brown, tan, dark brown, ﬁrm, packstone, carbonaceous, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, evenly scattered dull yellow, green ﬂuorescence, slow streaming to a weak cloudy yellow , green cut. The decision was made to trip out of the hole and pick up the curve assembly due to reaching the kick-off point at 10,680” MD on August 9, 2014 around 12:11 AM., CST. Drilling resumed on August 10, 2014. The decision was made to trip out of the hole for a new mud motor at 11,008’ MD on August 10, 2014 around 1:08 PM, CST. Drilling resumed on August 11, 2014. The rate of penetration averaged 0.99 min/ﬂ. and background gas averaged around 146 units. </p>

The Upper Bakken Shale was picked based on gamma and samples. The samples changed to Shale: Black, dark brown, blocky, ﬁssile, gritty to smooth, argillaceous, ﬁrm to hard, brittle, no porosity, no ﬂuorescence, instant fair streaming cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.62 min/ﬂ and background gas was around 399 units, with a max of 431 units. <br/>[Middle Bakken 11,107'MD 11,038’ T VD -8,668' SS <br/>The Middle Bakken zone was next seen. The Middle Bakken was picked based on gamma and sample changes. This formation consisted of Limestone: Gray, light gray, cream-gray, light brown, tan, soﬁ to ﬁrm, silty, microcrystalline, argillaceous, slightly dolomitic, poor intercrystalline porosity; even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming <br/>cloudy cut.

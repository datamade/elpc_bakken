Sidewinder 104 cemented 1042' of heavy weight drill pipe and a liner running tool in the 7" 351! after setting the liner hanger. Drill pipe was backed off at 9318' and an attempt was made to wash over the fish but the wash pipe was twisted off. Top of wash pipe fish is at 9237'. The plan forward is to temporarily abandon the well. move off with Sidewinder 104 and move in a smaller rig to resume further recovery operations. The well was positive pressure tested to 2000 psi with no indication of pressure leak off. The plan for temporary abandonment will be as follows: Run Cast Iron Bridge Plug (ClBP) to setting depth of 9090’ on wireline, set ClBP and pressure test to ensure proper weilbore sealing. Circulate clean produced brine (MW 9.8) to surface, dump 10’ of sand on top of ClBP to ensure that any solids that settle out of brine are caught on top of the sand. Trip out and set back pressure valve in wellhead. Nipple down BOPS and install Temporary Abandonment cap. The well will be inspected at least annually for the presence of pressure or leakage at the surface. The lnpsectlon date and pressure reading will be report on the TA Extension if one is requested. Any pressure or leakage will be reported immediately. If a smaller rig is not mobilized to the well within 120 days, Statoil will dump ball 5 sacks of cement on the ClBP. <br/>N0 1 ' an 24 4m; Mia/auto u <br/>77 <br/>Company Telephone Number Statoil Oil 8.

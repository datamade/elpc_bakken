The casing shoe was drilled out with a 5 7/8” PDC bit and directional tools. Upon drilling out into open formation, the background gas was near 50 units. The curve was landed with an inclination near 87.5 degrees. Drilling of the lateral began at 8:05 PM CT, February 17, 2015. While drilling out laterally, the decision was made to slowly climb in section. While drilling ahead, slides for azimuth were used to turn the well path from 150 to 180 degrees. The ROP was near IOOﬁ/hr while rotating. The goal was to stay low in section, approximately 10ft above the lower Three Forks Shale near the lower cool gamma marker. While in the lower clean bench, the samples increased in grain size, and the gamma was near 60 AP]. The background gas was near 100 units. <br/>The inclination was building while rotating, causing the need to slide down often. The inclination held steady near 90 degrees, until a survey depth of 12,739ft. At this depth, the inclination started to decrease, The inclination decreased to as low as 87.07 degrees at a survey depth of 12,864ft. While making the turn for azimuth, surveys were taken every 32ft, until a survey depth of 13,127ﬁ, when the interval was increased to 44ft, due to the drill pipe being this length. Surveys were taken every 44ft, until the turn was ﬁnished at a measured depth of 13,609ﬁ. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The inclination was remaining near the formational dip while rotating. This allowed several hundred feet to be drilled in between slides. The Pason EDR computer was changed out while drilling. This caused the need to have to go back and re-log gamma. The ROP was near lSOﬁ/hr while rotating The well path was deﬂected upward at a survey depth of 16,772ft. This increased the inclination from 89.17 to 90.92 degrees. A downward slide was used to decrease the inclination While drilling ahead after this slide, the inclination continued to decrease while rotating. It decreased to as low as 87.75 degrees at a survey depth of 17,124ﬁ. Several upward slides were then used to increase the inclination. While decreasing in section, the samples increased in grain size, and the gamma decreased to near 60API. The background gas increased from near 150 units, to near 1,400 units after a measured depth of 17,300ft. It was not until a survey depth of 17,344ft, in which the inclination was increased to above 90 degrees. The inclination then continued to building while rotating. The inclination increased to as high as 93.26 degrees at survey depth of 17,564ﬁ. While climbing in section, the samples decreased in grain size and increased in platy blue green shale. With the sample change, the gamma increased from 60 AP], to near 100 API. The background gas decreased from 1,400 units, to near 500 units. <br/>The decision was made to decrease in section to see the cool gamma marker at the base of the zone.

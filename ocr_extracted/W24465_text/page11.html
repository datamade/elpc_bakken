Gas will be gathered into ORM's Crosby (Divide) and Alamo (Divide/Williams) systems and processed at ORM’s Stateline Plant in Williams County, $21-T155N103w. ORM installed low-pressure gas gathering lines in the eastern standup units of Smoky Butte Field (system map attached) in 2013 to gather and process gas from 2 Baytex USA operated wells in the field. No other midstream gas gathering lines exist in the immediate area at present. ROW acquisition is in progress by ORM for buildout of the Smoky 'Butte Field gas gathering system. ORM projects the tie-in of NPE’s Smoky Butte producing spacing units into their system starting in October 2014 with anticipated completion by January 2015. The Stewart 160-100-28-33-3B-1H pad location is located along OneOk’s gathering line Ro-w and will commence gas sales upon its completion in 2015. <br/>ORM’s nearest gas plant and compressor station design capacities and current throughput volumes as of July 1, 2014 are described below. ORM’s Crosby Station will handle 20 MMcfd and have spare capacity by 4014. Their Crosby and Alamo gathering systems are projected to handle 100% of NPE’s gas production with new well initial rates projected at 375 Mcfd peak production per well. <br/>OneOk Stateline I II Plant Crosby Compressor Station <br/>Max design capacity: 200 MMcfd Current capacity: 15 MMcfsd <br/>Current thruput: 150 MMcfsd Current thruput: 14 MMcfsd <br/>Future ORM McKenzie Plants will divert thruput Current horsepower: 4500 hp <br/>Alamo Compressor Station 3014 hp upgrade: 1500 hp (6000 hp total) Current capacity: 15 MMcfsd 3014 cap. with hp upgrade: 20 MMcfsd Current Thruput: 8 MMcfsd 2015 hp upgrade: 3000 hp (9000 hp total) Current horsepower: 4500 hp 2015 cap. with hp upgrade: 30 MMcfsd <br/>3015 hp upgrade: +3000 hp (for 7500 hp total) 3015 capacity with hp upgrade: 25 MMcfsd <br/>NPE is scheduled to drill the Stewart 160-100—28-33-3B-lH location in 2015. NPE has spud the Amundson well (File No. 23707) and will also drill in 2014 the 2 Stevens pad wells (File Nos. 28519, 28520) in the field, and complete in 0ct/Nov-2014. Well flowback will commence during lateral cleanout, and the wells will be put on ESP after cleanout operations are completed. Anticipated average IP90 rates are 400 BOPD and 325 Mcfd. NPE utilizes wellhead gas for electric power generation for artificial lift and SWD pump operations. <br/>NPE currently utilizes 20% of its produced gas in North Dakota for electric power generation for its 6 producing wells and 3 SWD wells it operates. NPE presently flares in total approximately 80% ("750 Mcfd) of its gas production on a statewide basis. This flare % ratio is projected to decline to <50% by 10/15/2014 and <20% by 1/1/2015 with ORM’s gas gathering installation in the T160/161-R100 area in the 2"“ half of 2014. NPE currently operates 3 wells in the Smoky Butte Field with a flare rate of 80%. All of NPE’s Smoky Butte wells are scheduled to be tied into ORM’s sales line within the next 3-4 months, with the three new 2014 wells to be tied in upon commencement of production in 4014. No other alternatives to gas flaring (than current power generation use of gas) are considered economic at this time, given the forecast of gas sales commencing in 3-4 months. </p>

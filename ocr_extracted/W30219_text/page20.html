The Eckert Foundation 152-102-22-14-10TFH well was spudded on January 13, 2015 with surface drilled and cased to be resumed at a later date. Patterson 320 spudded the Eckert Foundation 152-102-22-14-10TFH well on February 23, 2015 and reached a total depth of 20,686’ MD on March 20, 2015. Wellsite geological services began at 9,000 on February 26, 2015 at 2:30 AM MST. The initial phase of the Eckert Foundation 152-10222-15-10TFH is a vertical and curve landing in the Three Forks Formation on March 1, 2015. The single lateral well targeting the ﬁrst bench of the Three Forks Formation approximately 8-17 feet of TVD into the Three Forks was started on March 11, 2015. Thirty-foot samples were collected throughout the vertical and curve with ﬁﬁy foot samples collected in the lateral. All samples were washed, catalogied, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 9, 000’ — 10,509’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 9,000’ MD in the Charles/Madison formation on February 26, 2015 at 2:30 AM MST. Gas detection system was tested before logging depth with system functioning correctly. Drill rates before encountering the Base Last Salt ranged from 023-237 minutes per foot and averaging 0.87 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 22-146 units averaging 52 units. A typical sample was: LIMESTONE: Gray to gray brown, light gray, light gray tan, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, fair induration, poor to no intergranular porosity, 10% salt, frosty clear to clear, compacted, trace white anhydrite, even yellow green ﬂorescence, slow fair streaming cut. <br/>Base of Last Salt 9,3 70’ MD 9,360’ TVD - 7,068’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was picked 2 feet lower than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and differential pressure. Drill rates below the Base of the Last Salt ranged from 0.53—5.07 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 1.2 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 22-107 units averaging 70 units. A typical sample was: HALITE: Frosty clear to clear, compacted, 10% limestone, light gray to gray, argillaceous, poor to fair induration trace imbedded anhydrite, off white, cream, cream tan, pasty, even mineral ﬂuorescence, fast fair milky cut. <br/>Mission Canyon 9, 586’ MD 9,5 75 ’ TVD —7,283 ’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was picked 3 feet lower than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and differential pressure. Drill rates in the Mission Canyon formation ranged from 0.33—3.5 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 1.12 </p>

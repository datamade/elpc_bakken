    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The top of the Lodgepole was encountered at 10,108’ MD, 10,091’ TVD picked 2 feet lower than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and differential pressure. Drill rates in the Lodgepole above KOP of 10,509’ MD ranged from 023—407 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 1.3 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 17-370 units averaging 94 units. Typical samples were: LIMESTONE: Gray to light gray, dark gray, light gray tan, cryptocrystalline, dolomitic in part, argillaceous, fair to good induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull green ﬂorescence, weak milky cut. Curve tools were picked up once kick off point of 10,509’ MD was reached at 2:25 PM MST on February 27, 2015. <br/>Curve 10,509’— 11,313’MD <br/>Drilling of the curve began at 3:00 AM MST on February 28, 2015. An initial landing target of 10,946’ TVD was set before curve was started. Drilling rates in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged from 0.48—48 minutes per foot with an average of 1.17 minutes per foot. Gas in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged from 11—3783 units with average of 291 units. Gamma ranged from 17-77 API with an average of 33 API. Typical samples were: LIMESTONE: Dark gray, gray to light gray, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, dolomitic in part, fair induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence, poor to fair milky cut. Gamma markers throughout the Lodgepole and formation tops of the False Bakken, Upper Bakken Shale, and Middle Bakken were used to correlate with the Eckert Foundation 152-102-22-15-1H, Eckert Foundation 152-102-22-15-3H, and Eckert 22-14X showing a landing target of 10,946’ TVD, the same as projected. The curve reached TD of NH) 11313 / INC 89.10 / AZ 343.30/TVD 10945.61 /VS 709.16 at 1:25 AM MST on March 1, 2015. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 10,973 ’ MD 1 0, 856 ’ TVD -8, 564 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Upper Bakken Shale was picked at 10,973’ MD, 10,856” TVD picked 3 feet higher compared to prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and gamma ray. Background gas ranged from 90-645 units with average showing 318 units. Drilling rates in the Upper Bakken Shale ranged from 0.3—6.2 minutes per foot with an average of 1.35 minutes per foot. Gamma ranged from 109-255 API with an average of 233 API. Typical samples were: SHALE: Black to very dark gray, abundantly carbonaceous, waxy smooth, blocky compaction, platy in part, 30% limestone, dark gray to medium gray, heavy dark oil staining, even gold ﬂuorescence, rapid bright yellow streaming cut. </p>

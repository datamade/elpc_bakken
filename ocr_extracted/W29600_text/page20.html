Choke size will depend on ﬁnal shut in pressure post frac and well pressure prior to opening the choke. The choke will be adjusted up or down based on ﬂowing pressure, liquid rates and sand returns, to prevent clogging manifold chokes. During ﬂowback, the water chlorides and sand content will be monitored. When the water chlorides are greater than 100,000 ppm and the produced ﬂuids contain no sand, the wells will be turned to production facilities. Since the pipeline is already at the location of the pad and Oxy will have its production facilities constructed before ﬂowback starts, and gas sales should start as soon as the wells start ﬂowing through the production facilities, unless there are capacity issues on ONEOK’s system at that time. Based on current information, it is our belief the system can take this gas upon completion of the Kenneth Stroh 3-12-lH-143-97 well. <br/>This well is forecasted to initially ﬂow 700 barrels of oil and 300 thousand cubic feet of gas per day based on Oxy’s production type curve of this area. It is anticipated this well will decline sharply after initial production as do the majority of horizontal wells in the Williston Basin. <br/>Current Flaring <br/>The table below shows gas being ﬂared by Oxy per North Dakota State Industrial Commission’s May 2014 Oil and Gas Production Report. </p>

Below are three alternatives that 0xy considered from a conceptual standpoint to reduce the amount of gas ﬂared. <br/>More generally, Oxy is continuing to review the possible impact of implementing one or more of these alternatives as appropriate in our operations. </p>

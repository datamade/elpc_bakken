This 450” OD gathering line traverses approximately one-half mile before connecting to an 8.625” OD gathering line. This 8.625” OD gathering extends approximately 6.5 miles and then connects to a 6.625” OD gathering line. This 6.625” OD gathering line extends approximately 4.5 miles then connects to an 8.625” 0D gathering line. This 8.625” gathering line is approximately 3.5 miles in length and is connected to the inlet piping of the ONEOK’s Little Knife compressor station. This will be the primary ﬂow path of gas delivered to ONEOK from this pad. As noted under “Gathering System”, above, the gas will have secondary flow paths due to the dynamics of ONEOK’s gathering system. The table below shows the capacities and current ﬂows of the primary gathering lines connecting this well. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">ONEOK’s low pressure gathering system is near capacity in this area due to several new wells recently connected. It is projected that the system will have capacity when this well is ready for production due to decline on the existing wells gathered on this segment of the system and ONEOK’s project listed in the following paragraph. <br/>ONEOK is in the process of adding compressors at its Lost Bridge compressor station in Section 14, T147N, R96W, Dunn County and installing a 16” OD low pressure gathering line that will start in T145N, R94W, Dunn County (Dunn Center) and end at the inlet of the Lost Bridge compressor station. Construction of these facilities will redirect gas that currently ﬂows on the secondary ﬂow paths of the K Stroh 13 Pad to ﬂow on the new facilities. Although this does not directly increase the capacity of the secondary ﬂow paths of the K Stroh 13 Pad, it redirects gas that currently ﬂows on the same pipelines to a different compressor station, in essence reducing volumes transported on the ﬂow paths for these wells. ONEOK is also planning on constructing a new discharge line from its Lost Bridge compressor station that will deliver some of the gas </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">able to bring the wellbore up in zone enough to see the warmer gamma above the target line. Dip was conﬁrmed near 89.7 degrees and the target adjustment #4 was made. At 13,350’ MD target adjustment #4 lowered the target line 5’ and set target inclination at 89.7 degrees. Average ROP at this time was 266 ft/hr and shows were poor. Formation correlated well with target dip for approximately 900’ through a series of several localized dips that brought the target line progressively higher in the ideal geological window. At 16,200’ MD target adjustment #5 lowered the line an additional 5’ in zone and decreased target inclination slightly to 89.65 degrees. Formation dip would ﬂuctuate slightly through a series of localized dips, but would largely match well with the trending pattern of the I-l-2 offset and overall expected dip of 89.7 degrees, and drilling continued normally along the updated targets for the remainder of the lateral. The well was completed 5’ low of the target drilling line, at the base of the ideal geological window. <br/>Total depth was reached on December 27, 2014 at 10:28 pm. CST at a measured depth of 20,640’ and a true vertical depth of 10,725.61 ’. The Middle Bakken lateral took a total of 3 days and 13 hours to complete, including surveys and down time. The lateral was drilled approximately 70% in zone with an average background gas of 146 units (including connection gases). Average drill rate was 190 ft/hr including slides, with max ROP reaching 300 -325 ﬁ/hr continuously in sections. The EN-VP&R-154-94-2536H-4 bottom hole location would be 771.72’ FSL & 1,277.52’ FEL in Section 36 T154N R94W. </p>

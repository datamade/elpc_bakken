    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">picked at a sharp increase in rate of penetration and change in sample from limestone to shale. Gamma also spiked, reaching as high as 638 API. Background gas ranged from 415 to 488 units, averaging 458 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.27 to 0.93 minutes per foot, averaging 0.42 minutes per foot. The upper Bakken was described as black dolomitic shale with no visible porosity and a weak cloudy green cut. <br/>Mddle Bakken 10,127’ MD 10,069’ T VD -7,834’SS <br/>The top of the Middle Bakken was picked at a decrease in rate of penetration and gamma. The ﬁrst sample caught in the Middle Bakken was described as dolomite; gray, light gray, cream gray, microcrystalline, sucrosic, argillaceous, poorly indurated; 10% shale, black, ﬁssile, blocky, carbonaceous, 15% siltstone, light gray, medium gray, argillaceous, poorly indurated; fair to good porosity; even dull green ﬂuorescence, bright cloudy blue cut with faint yellow streamers. Rate of penetration in the Middle Bakken ranged from 0.47 to 1.07 minutes per foot, averaging 0.62 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 297 to 892 units, averaging 532 units. Gamma ranged from 56 to 118 API, averaging 91 API. The clean “B” bench seen elsewhere is absent here. <br/>Lower Bakken 10,221 ’ MD 10,120’ T VD - 7,885 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Lower Bakken Shale was picked at an increase in rate of penetration and gamma. Sample changed from sandstone to black shale. Gamma peaked <br/>at 836 API and averaged 662 API. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.20 to 0.97 minutes per foot and averaged 037 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 443 to 881 units and <br/>averaged 583 units. <br/>Three Forks 10,299’ 1WD 10,144’ T VD -7,909’ SS </p>

Rate of penetration in the Three Forks while drilling the curve ranged from 0.33 to 1.27 minutes per foot and averaged 0.60 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 22 to 499 units and averaged 295 units Gamma ranged from 35 to 119 API and averaged 76 API. Initially samples were sandstone; gray tan, light gray, tan, very ﬁne, subrounded, well sorted, argillaceous, silty, poorly cemented, dolomitic cement; 10% shale, light gray green, pyritic, blocky; scattered siltstone, medium gray; poor porosity; scattered dull green ﬂuorescence, milky green yellow cut. Samples transitioned to a majority tan sandstone with fair porosity. Intermediate casing point was reached at 10,382’ measured depth on December 7, 2014 at 5:45 pm. Projection to bit put the wellbore at a TVD of 10,157’ at 85.35 degrees, approximately 5’ above the top of the target window. <br/>Lateral 10,485’—19,874’ <br/>Intermediate 7” casing was successfully ran and set to 10,362’ measured depth. Some difﬁculty was encountered while drilling out intermediate; drilling began in the lateral at 4:40 pm on January 11, 2015. No notable trip gas aﬁer drilling out the shoe. </p>

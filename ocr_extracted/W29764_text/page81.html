Rate of penetration ranged from 0.23 to 4.39 minutes per foot and averaged 0.58 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 112 to 219 units and averaged 148 units. <br/>Base of Last Salt 8,564 ’ MD 8,555 ’ T VD -6,320’ SS <br/>The base of the last salt was picked by a decrease in rate of penetration, gamma markers, and change in sample from salt to limestone. The BLS came in 6’ high to prognosis. Samples below the last salt were majority limestone. </p>

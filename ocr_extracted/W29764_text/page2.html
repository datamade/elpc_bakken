    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">After the set line was encountered at 13,665’ the wellbore continued to drill in the target window until again reaching the set line at 16,550’. Formation dip was calculated at 89.8 degrees between those points. The hot gamma of the Aquitard was brieﬂy encountered at 14,600’, remaining there until 14,900’. In the interval from 13,665’ to 16,5 50’ samples were consistent, most described as sandstone; cream, cream tan, translucent, very ﬁne, subrounded to subangular, moderately sorted, poorly cemented, dolomitic cement; scattered siltstone, light gray; scattered shale, light blue green; rare pyrite; good porosity; scattered green ﬂuorescence, cloudy green faint streaming cut. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.23 to 4.67 minutes per foot and averaged 0.45 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 17 to 835 units and averaged 396 units. Gamma ranged from 39 to 159 API and averaged 71 API. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The wellbore encountered the set line at 16,550’ and 17,676’, at which time formation clip was calculated at 89.6 degrees. As the wellbore dropped in TVD gamma started to gradually increase, indicating the wellbore was nearing the base of the window. Sliding brought the wellbore higher in TVD until the gamma transition of the set line was encountered at 18,395’. This contact indicated the formation had begun to updip at approximately 90.14 degrees. The wellbore began to track an inclination above 90 degrees. The decision was made to slide down in order to get back into the clean gamma bench, since the updip was not expected to continue. The set line was again encountered at 18, 848’, indicating formation was ﬂat at 90 degrees. <br/>At 19,147 ’ it was determined the motor had failed, necessitating a trip. Once on bank it was determined the bit and bit box had been left in the hole. The decision was <br/>made to pick up a new assembly and sidetrack to ﬁnish the well. The original wellbore reached total measured depth of 19,147’ at 10:00 pm on January 18, 2015. </p>

After successfully kicking off the sidetrack the wellbore dropped down into the Aquitard from 17,800’ to 18,800”. In this interval the rate of penetration ranged from 0.27 to 7.3 minutes per foot and averaged 0.58 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 11 to 6544 units and averaged 469 units. Gamma ranged from 58 to 155 API and <br/>averaged 124 API. Sample from this interval were typically described as sandstone; cream, light tan, translucent, rare pyrite, very ﬁne grain, subangular, subrounded, moderately sorted, moderately to poorly cemented, dolomitic cement; 20% light gray siltstone, laminated, platy, 15% light blue shale, off white, pyritic, platy; fair to poor porosity, faint patchy ﬂuorescence, weak white blue cut. <br/>Sliding brought the wellbore higher in TVD, encountering the set line at 18, 848’. The assembly began to drop on rotation, tracking along the top of the target window. The set line was reencountered at 19,810’, conﬁrming the dip rate of 89.9 degrees. Sample quality was greatly decreased after the sidetrack due to the considerable amount of <br/>chemical lube used. </p>

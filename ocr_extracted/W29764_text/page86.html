    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The top of the 10’ target window is set 11’ below the base of the lower Bakken shale. There is a consistent clean gamma contact 2’ below the top of the target window, which is used as the “set line”. <br/>High side sliding began aﬁer drilling out because the survey shot just outside the casing was at 84.42 degrees. The Aquitard was encountered at 10,530’. After the high side sliding produced opposite results it was decided to trip out due to a possible torqued scribe line. The BHA was re-scribed and tripped back in the hole. Sliding resumed, bringing the wellbore up out of the Aquith at 11,470’. Dip calculated to 90 degrees between those points. While drilling in the Aquitard the samples were generally described as sandstone; oﬁ white, translucent, cream, pale pink/orange, silty, very ﬁne grain, subangular' to subrounded, moderately to poorly sorted, dolomitic cement; scattered light gray siltstone, 25% shale, light blue, off white, pale pink, platy, ﬁssile; poor porosity, faint dull white ﬂuorescence, no out In the interval from 10,530’ to 11,470’ rate of penetration ranged from 0.20 to 2.53 minutes per foot and averaged 0.62 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 17 to 331 units and averaged 85 units. Aﬂer tripping in the hole trip gas peaked to 3083 units. Gamma ranged from 75 to 161 API and averaged 127 API. <br/>The wellbore continued to rise in true vertical depth, reaching the gamma contact at 11,864’. Formation dip was calculated at 89.85 degrees at that point. The wellbore continued to rise in TVD, drilling in the upper 2’ of the target window until the top of the target window was exited at 12,500’. While drilling in the target window from 11,500’ to 12,500’ samples were typically described as sandstone; cream, light tan, translucent, very ﬁne to ﬁne, subrounded, moderately to well sorted, poorly cemented, dolomitic cement; scattered shale, light blue green, pyritic; trace siltstone; rare pyrite; fair to good porosity; scattered dull green ﬂuorescence, yellow green faint streaming cut. In this interval the rate of penetration ranged from 0.20 to 3.47 minutes per foot and averaged 0.47 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 17 to 505 units and averaged 251 units. Gamma ranged from 38 to 126 API and averaged 77 API. A trip was made at 12,418’ for slow rate of penetration. While tripping in the tool failed to test, so another trip was made before any new formation was drilled. After returning to bottom trip gas spiked to 9065 units with a 20’ ﬂare. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The wellbore continued to build until sliding brought the wellbore down to reencounter the set line. At this time formation dip calculated to 89.5 degrees from 12,364’ to 13,665’. While drilling above the target window a typical sample was described as sandstone; light brown, tan, translucent, very ﬁne, subrounded, moderately sorted, poorly cemented, dolomitic cement; 20% shale, light blue green, off white, pyritic, ﬁssile; 5% siltstone, light gray, laminated, platy; scattered pyrite; fair porosity; scattered dull green ﬂuorescence, cloudy blue green cut. In this interval the rate of penetration ranged ﬁom 0.27 to 5.57 minutes per foot and averaged 0.76 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 17 to 802 units and averaged 385 units. Gamma ranged from 45 to 129 API and averaged 98 AP]. A trip was made at 13,354’; no signiﬁcant trip gas was recorded at that time. </p>

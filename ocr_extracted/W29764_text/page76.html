G Bergstrom 31-13TFH is a horizontal well with the two mile lateral across sections 13 and 24, targeting the Three Forks. The G Bergstrom 31-13TFH was spudded November 21, 2014 at 10:00 pm. The original wellbore reached total measured depth of 19147’ at 10 pm on January 18 due to losing the bit in the hole. Bottom hole location of the original wellbore is in the SWSE of Section 24 T156N R97W; 1109.21 ’ FSL & 2618.50’ FEL. Sidetrack 1 reached a total measured depth of 19,874’ on January 21, 2015 at 11:00 am. Wellsite geological services were provided by Jessica Stark, Matt McHugh, and Jennifer Meidinger of Neset Consulting Service. A Total Gas Detection system was utilized for gas analysis. Samples were caught every thirty feet throughout the vertical and curve and every ﬁfty feet throughout the lateral, as well as intermediate samples when necessary. One set of samples was washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 7,200’ — 9, 770’ 1WD <br/>Logging services began at 7,200’ measured depth in the Tyler at 2:30 pm on December 4‘“, 2014. <br/>Tyler 7,170’ 1WD 7,162’ TVD -4,927’ SS </p>

The ﬁrst sample in the Tyler was anhydrite. As drilling continued the samples consisted of beds of orange red siltstone and gray limestone. Overall the Tyler had poor porosity and little oil shows. Total gas ranged from 73 to 219 units and averaged 139 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.17 to 3.97 minutes per foot and averaged 0.58 minutes per foot. <br/>Kibbey Lime 7, 718’ 1WD 7, 771 ’ TVD -5,4 75 ’ SS <br/>The Kibbey Lime was picked at a drop in gamma and the sample change ﬁom a reddish sandstone to a cream gray limestone.

Aﬁer drilling out of the shoe the samples consisted of DOLOMITE: Light tan, cream, light brown, light gray, gray, off white, silty, microcrystalline, very ﬁne, microsucrosic, mottled, calcareous, carbonaceous, soﬂ to ﬁrm, argillaceous, moderate pyrite, poor intergranular porosity, dull yellow ﬂuorescence, very weak streaming cut. <br/>The inclination of the formation was calculated at a 90.35° overall dip. The inclination coming out of the shoe was an 87.63°. The directional team utilized slides to bring the wellbore back up close to the calculated dip. The directional team also began a 28° turn in the wellbore from 28° to 0° azimuth. The turn began at 10,506’ MD and ended at 11,418’ MD. Samples alter the turn consisted of DOLOMITE: Light brown, light to medium tan, light to dark cream, cream tan, very light blue, silty, microcrystalline, very ﬁne, microsucrosic, mottled, calcareous, carbonaceous, soft to ﬁrm, argillaceous, moderate pyrite, poor intergranular porosity, dull even yellow ﬂuorescence, slow cloudy out <br/>At 12,600’ MD the wellbore began climbing in inclination. The inclination reached as high as 93.53°. Here the samples were DOLOMITE: Very light to medium brown, light tan, very light to medium cream tan, cream, light gray, silty, microcrystalline, very ﬁne, microsucrosic, mottled, calcareous, carbonaceous, soft to ﬁrm, argillaceous, minor pyrite, poor intergranular porosity, very weak orange ﬂuorescence, slow streaming cut. The directional team used slides to bring the wellbore back down to around 90°. </p>

LACT meter used in the measurement will be proved according to the section below entitled "Current EOG Oil Sales LACT Proving". <br/>Well oil allocation meters will be proved on a quarterly basis using either a positive displacement prover loop or from a test tank. <br/>Volumes will be reported to appropriate agencies through routine oil production reports filed monthly. <br/>Current EOG Oil Sales LACT Proving: The time between LACT proving depends on the amount of oil sold through the LACT. It is the same for pipeline LACTs and truck LACTs as follows: <br/>a) LACT ships 2,000 bbls or more in a month: LACT proved every month. <br/>b) LACT ships less than 2,000 bbls in a month: LACT is proved every quarter. <br/>0) In addition, to establish a comparative meter factor for a new LACT, the initial proving is <br/>followed by a second proving a month later, regardless of how much oil is shipped through the LACT for that month. <br/>Gas Continuous Measurement: individual Well “Monthly Well GAS PRODUCTION”: <br/>8) <br/>Volumes of gas shall be metered at a dedicated single well separator/treater (at central facility) using either orifice plate or v-cone and Electronic Flow Measurement (EFM). </p>

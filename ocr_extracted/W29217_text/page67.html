Detailed Flowback Strategy <br/>High Rate Flowbacks: Wells will be flowed back sequentially, 2—3 wells at a time, for an estimated duration of 2-10 days per well. Anticipated gas rates will range from LOGO—4,000 Mcfd per well. <br/>Anticipated Date of First Production: The CCU Golden Creek / North Coast 23 Quad Pad wells are scheduled for first production through permanent facilities in March 2015. Exact first production date may differ due to actual time required to complete each phase of the project. <br/>Anticipated Oil and Gas Rates (through permanent facilities): <br/>— — Mcfd Total Month one av: 2,600-4,000 1.0804580 600-1000 <br/>Plan for Startup: All four wells at the CCU Golden Creek/ North Coast 23 Quad Pad will be put online once the permanent facilities build is completed. <br/>       <br/>              <br/>        <br/>5.

Alternatives to Flaring: Burlington Resources will reduce wellhead production to ensure compliance with mandated gas capture targets. </p>

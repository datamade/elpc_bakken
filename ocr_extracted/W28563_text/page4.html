Gas averaged 118 units overall, with a peak of 296 units. A typical sample was a ﬁne to very ﬁne-grained, well sorted sandstone and siltstone, with subangular to subrounded grain textures and calcareous cement. The Middle Bakken came in with prognosis. <br/>Lower Bakken Shale 1 0, 921 ' MD 1 0, 830' TVD -8, 557' SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale was picked off of ROP, gamma, and sample change. The sample consisted of shale, which was black, very dark gray, ﬁrm, moderately <br/>compacted, blocky, platy in part, carbonaceous, calcareous, pyritic, patchy dull yellow green ﬂuorescence, instant milky cut, Gas reached as high as 236 units.

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Three Forks Formation picked off of ROP, gamma, and sample change. Gas ranged from 96 to 156 units. The sample consisted of mostly siltstones that were light to medium gray, medium gray brown, medium brown, trace cream, very ﬁne to ﬁne grained, soﬂ, ﬁrm in part, microsucrosic, slightly argillaceous, subround to round, poor to fair intergranular porosity, with patchy dull yellow green ﬂuorescence, and a slow cloudy to milky cut. The Three Forks came in 2’ high to prognosis. <br/>The curve was drilled to 11,175’ MD on October 8, 2014’ at 12:10 am CT. Casing was set at 11,160’ MD and showed 20’ into the Three Forks. <br/>Laterall 11,160’——14,000’MD <br/>Casing was exited on November 14, 2014 at 8:05 am CT. Casing was set approximately 20’ into the Three Forks. The planned target was a 17’ window, with a hot marker at the top and a higher gamma layer in the bottom 7’ with a cleanup indicating going out of the bottom of target zone. Emphasis while drilling was intended to be the top 11’ of target zone which was a cleaner gamma signature with some thin hotter markers mixed in. There was also a signiﬁcant azimuth turn of 32° to make over the ﬁrst 1,800’ of the lateral. Drilling began with the bit at the bottom of the clean gamma window and leveling off just into the hotter gamma below while making the azimuth turn. At 11,800’ MD the bit came back up into the cleaner gamma. Drilling continued with the bit traversing up and down within this upper portion of target until reaching the end of this section where it showed being 3’ from the top of target. This cleaner gamma portion of the target zone showed some apparent hard streaks that correlated with gamma heat ups These streaks did cause some bouncing but not severe enough cause control problems. </p>

It was located in SW, SW, Section 1, T152N, R99W, McKenzie County, North Dakota. <br/>The Skarston 1-12-4H was spudded on September 17, 2014. Well site geological services consisted of two person mud-logging unit from 8,300 in the Otter Formation until, the end of the well. A Geospect was used for gas detection. Two sets of lagged samples in thirty, ﬁfty, and one hundred foot intervals were caught and saved to be archived. <br/>Vertical Hole Surface to 10,490}? MD <br/>The Skarston 1-12—4H was spudded on September 17, 2014', 9 5/8” surface casing was set at 1,997ft. The vertical well was drilled using 5” drill pipe and collars. <br/>Kibbey Lime 8424ftMD 8418ft TVD -6462ft ss <br/>The Kibbey Lime was drilled at a TVD of 8,424ft. The formation was composed of limestone. The limestone was light to medium gray, gray, to medium brown gray in color. It was argillaceous to carbonaceous in part, with moderate to poor induration. The samples showed poor to no visible porosity and moderate Yellow ﬂuorescence, with good cloudy cut. The formation was chosen by a change in lithology from varicolored shales, to a clean limestone. With the lithology change, the gamma cooled from near 75 to 20 API. The ROP while in the Kibbey was near IOOﬁ/hr. The background gas remained near 16 units. While in the Kibbey, the decision was made to trip out of the hole at a measured depth of 856911, for a planned bit replacement. <br/>Charles Salt 8565]? MD 8560f! TVD ~6604ft SS <br/>The Charles Salt was encountered at a depth of 8,560ﬁ TVD. This was chosen from gamma markers and an increase an in penetration rates. The samples showed only a trace of salt aﬁer washing them. The ROP while drilling within the Charles Salt was near lOOﬁ/hr. The ROP decreased while drilling within interbedded layers of anhydrite and limestone to near 60ﬁ/hr. <br/>Base of Last Salt 9,330ft All) 9,324]? TVD -7,430ft SS The last major salt bed was encountered at a depth of 9,324ft TVD. This was <br/>chosen primarily from gamma markers and an increase in penetration rates. The samples showed only a trace of salt aﬁer washing them. </p>

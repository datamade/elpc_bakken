Statewide percentage of gas flared (total gas flared/total gas produced) for existing wells producing from the Bakken petroleum system. Note industry target goals are to reduce flaring to 26% by 9114, 23% by 1-1-15, 15% by 1-1-16, and 10% by 9-1-20. b. Fieldwide percentage of gas flared. 6. Alternatives to flaring. a. Explain specific alternate systems available for consideration. b. Detail expected flaring reductions if such plans are implemented. <br/>Permit consideration may be delayed or stipulations may be imposed (such as production restrictions) if applicant is unable to timely connect the subject well and alternatives to reduce the amount of flared gas will not be implemented. <br/>The NDIC believes a concerted effort by operators in North Dakota is necessary to reduce the volume of flared gas, reduce the number of wells flaring, and reduce duration of flaring of wells, which will ultimately meet our goal to encourage and promote the development, production, and utilization of oil and gas in the state in such a manner as will prevent waste, maximize eConornic recovery, and fully protect the correlative rights of all owners to the end that the landowners, the royalty owners, the producers, and the general public realize the greatest possible good from these vital natural resources. <br/>Should you require additional information, feel free to contact Our office. <br/>Sincerely, <br/>. <br/>Todd l..

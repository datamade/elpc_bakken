    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">siltstone had poor porosity, and interbedded dolomite. The dolomite was micro to very ﬁne grained, and limey and sucrosic in part. The samples had spotty dull yellow ﬂuorescence, and fast cloudy cuts. Background gas while drilling in the Middle Bakken Siltstone was near 1,100 units. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling of the lateral was started aﬂer seven inch casing was set at 11,180ﬁ, and the drilling ﬂuid was changed from oil based to salt water. The casing shoe was drilled out with a PDC bit and directional tools. Upon drilling out into open formation, the background gas was near 50 units. The curve was landed with an inclination near 85 degrees. While drilling out laterally, the decision was made to slowly come down in section to get a full pass of the gamma markers. While drilling ahead, slides for azimuth <br/>were used to turn the well path from 198 to 180 degrees. The ROP was near 150ﬁ/hr while rotating. <br/>Once the azimuth turn was ﬁnished and the well path was leveled off in the target zone, the ROP was increased to near 350ﬂ/hr. The survey intervals was increased form 44ft, to 88ft, after a survey depth of 12,338ﬁ. The inclination was building slightly while rotating, causing the need to slide down oﬁen. The background gas remained near 600 units, with connection gases near 900 units. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The inclination started to slowly decrease while rotating. This allowed several hundred feet to be rotated between slides. The samples remained siltstone with interbedded dolomite, with only minor changes. The gamma remained near 90 API. The inclination was deﬂected downward at a survey depth of 17,691ﬁ. The inclination decreased from 90.06, to 88.89 degrees. Several upward slides were needed to level oﬂ‘ the inclination. While climbing in section, the gas increased ﬁ'om near 520 units, to as high as 8,081 units at a measured depth of 18,583ft. The gas then decreased back to near 530 units. The inclination was building while rotating aﬁer a measured depth of 19,200ft. Slides were used to decrease the inclination about every 300ﬁ. <br/>Drilling continued to a measured depth of 21,755ﬁ. This was called total depth, due to hard line restrictions. Total depth for the lateral was reached at 10:30 AM CT, <br/>December 8, 2014. <br/>Conclusion </p>

Burlington Resources respectfully request a waiver from the tngpkr requirement included in NDAC43-02-O3-021: Casing, Tubing, and Cementing requirements during the completion period immediately following the upcoming fracture stimulatiOn. The following assurances apply: 1. The well is equipped with new 32# 7" casing from surface to 11144 MD with an API burst rating of 11640 psi 2. The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.80" API burst rating to determine the max pressure 3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment 4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during the flow back than during the frac 5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates 6. Productin equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing 7. A 300# gauge will be installed on surface casing during ﬂowback period <br/>      <br/>    <br/>Company Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Company LP <br/>Address 600 N. .‘ shford Road, P10-03-3030 <br/>City State Houston Tx <br/>Sig ature Printed Name 4 Donna Williams <br/>Title k Date Email Address <br/>FOR STATE USE ONLY <br/>          <br/>      <br/>PETROLEUM ENGINES? <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  </p>

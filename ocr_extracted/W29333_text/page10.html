Typical samples were a limestone consisting of medium gray, dark gray, light brown, packstone to wackestone, microcrystalline, ﬁrm to hard, very calcareous, slightly argillaceous, poor intergranular porosity, yellowish green ﬂuorescence, with a slow weak dull yellow cut. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Curve began on January 1st, 2015. KOP was at 10,736’ MD and 10,636’ TVD. This depth is 385 feet TVD into the Lodgepole formation. Drilling times ranged from 0.4 to 3.4 min/ﬂ and averaged 0.76 min/ﬂ. Gas averaged 433 units with values as <br/>high as 5,943 units. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the curve to correlate with the Wisness 150-100-23-14-12TFH well. <br/>Upper Bakken 11,382 ' MD 11, 083 ' TVD -8, 764 ' SS <br/>The top of the Upper Bakken was picked at 11,083’ TVD; -8,764’ SS from the samples changing from medium to dark gray limestone to a black to dark brown shale. Shale sample was black to dark brown, very carbonaceous, slightly silty, and blocky. Sample had a very dark brown ﬂuorescence and a rapid bright streaming cut. It was also picked by a drop in differential pressure and correlating gamma markings </p>

The Middle Bakken exhibited a Dolomite that was medium gray to tan gray, light gray, silty in part, microcrystalline, sub-rounded to subangular, carbonaceous, argillaceous, calcareous, moderate induration, good to fair intercrystalline porosity, scattered dull green to patchy yellow ﬂuorescence, with an instant blooming milky cut. <br/>Horizontal 11,535’—21,146’MD <br/>The Horizontal section was started, using brine water, in the Middle Bakken Formation at 11:40 AM CDT on January 4th, 2015. Drilling times ranged from 0.1 to 8.1 min/ﬂ Gas averaged 431 units with values as high as 5,943 units. Gamma was monitored and correlated to calculate formation dips throughout the Lateral. </p>

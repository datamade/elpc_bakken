Box 2353 Pinedale WY 82941 <br/>DETAILS OF WORK <br/>Continental Resources, Inc. requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. Continental Resources, Inc. intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface caslng with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used In the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and caslng plan as per the APO. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an Initial rlg that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under. any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Continental Resources, Inc. understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding conﬁdentiality pertaining to this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-0349 & 19.1). Continental Resources, Inc. will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site If the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rlg within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig. <br/>                                                                                                                             <br/>m Notice of Intent <br/>  <br/>Drilling Prognosis |j Spill Report <br/>Redriliing or Repair El Shooting Casing or Liner E] Acidizing <br/>Plug Well I] Fracture Treatment Supplemental HistOry U Change Production Method <br/>Temporarily Abandon E] Reclamation Other Spud with Small Rig <br/>    <br/>24-HOUR PRODUCTION RATE <br/>                 <br/>      <br/>  <br/>   <br/>    <br/>Company <br/>Continental Resources, Inc.

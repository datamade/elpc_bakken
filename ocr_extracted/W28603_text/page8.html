Calculate a sales factor by dividing the total “Actual Monthly Gas Sales” by the “M Theoretical Monthly Gas Production” volumes for the central production facility corrected as necessary for any time well was producing but measurement was not operational. Determine “Allocated Monthly Gas Sales” for each well by multiplying the respective individual well “Theoretical Monthly Gas Production” volume by the sales factor calculated in step (e) above. <br/>Gas Sales meter used in the measurement will be calibrated and maintained according to gas gathering contracts with commercial gathering entities and/or industry standard practices if performed by EOG Resources directly. <br/>Well gas allocation meters will be checked and calibrated on a standard timespan reflective of gas volume magnitude (large volumes quarterly, lower volumes every 6 months. Volumes will be reported to appropriate agencies through routine gas production reports filed monthly. </p>

This reflects that for similar crude oils gas volumes in solution within “saturated separator barrels” leaving treaters is primarily a function of separation “ﬂash” conditions and not producing GOR from the well. The coriolis meters at the treaters will be measuring “saturated” separator barrels containing the soon to be liberated tank gas vapor still in solution before finally flashing at tank conditions. <br/>Continuous Measurement: Individual Well “Montth Well WATER PRODUCTION”: Produced Water: A continuously measured well water meter volume shall be used for individual well <br/>produced water volume. </p>

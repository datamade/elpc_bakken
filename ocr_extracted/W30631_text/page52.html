    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Middle Bakken Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,393 feet, 3 feet high to the prognosis. The pick of the Middle Bakken was primarily done off gamma correlation to the Sondrol 11-3 TFH curve gamma. The lithology of the Middle Bakken Formation was siltstone that was gray to light gray, light gray brown, and dark gray that was ﬁne grained. Rate of penetration was an average of 35 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 3 11 units with a max of 477 units through the Middle Bakken Formation. <br/>Casing point was reached at 11,487' MD on March 4, 2015 at 7:40 PM CST in the Middle Bakken. Drilling ceased with a true vertical depth of 11,267.55 feet and measured depth of 11,487 feet, landing approximately 9.5 feet into the Middle Bakken Formation. <br/>Lateral Section <br/>Drilling resumed on January 18, 2015 at 1:50 AM CDT in the Middle Bakken Formation. According to the structure map, it was believed this well would average a 90.2 degree up dip - expecting formation to come up a total of approximately 30 feet throughout the lateral section. The Middle Bakken in this part of the Bully Field was expected to be 33 feet thick. A target window of 10 to 18 feet into the Middle Bakken Formation was set by Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation. Overall, formation trended up slightly throughout the well. In total, formation came up approximately 31 feet in total vertical depth. Mudloggers used A/C and C/D facie contacts along with a clean gamma signature which was one to two feet above target window to correlate dip and determine structural position. <br/>The Sondrol 11-3HU lateral was completed in three runs using three Reed SK516M-A1-Z style drill bits. The decision was made to TOOH for Gamma tool as well as slow ROP at 14,008‘ MD on March 22, 2015 at 2: 10 PM CDT. Drilling resumed at 4:45 AM CDT on March 23, 2015. The decision was made to sidetrack aﬁer shale exposure at 14,911' MD on March 23, 2015 at 12:20 PM CDT. Time drilling started at 3:40 PM CDT on March 23, 2015 to establish sidetrack #1 beginning at 14,258' MD. Time drilling completed at 14,271' MD on March 24, 2015 at 2:40 AM CDT. The decision was made to TOOH for MWD tool failure at 14,271' MD on March 24, 2015 at 2:45 AM CDT. Drilling resumed at 5:10 PM CDT on March 24, 2015. </p>

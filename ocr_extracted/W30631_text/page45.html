The well was drilled by Pioneer 74 ﬂex rig and is located in the NWNW quarter of Section 3 T148N R99W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Sondrol 11-3HU was spudded on February 24, 2015 at 9:00 AM CST. The well reached a total depth of 21,227 ’ MD on March 26, 2015. Geological services began at 9,450’ MD in the Charles Formation on March 1, 2015 and continued to TD. Samples were caught by mudloggers throughout the well. All samples were washed, cataloged, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Society in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Total Gas LTD gas equipment was used to monitor gas throughout the well in correspondence with NOV RigSense EDR. <br/>Vertical 9,450’ — 10, 752’ MD </p>

Rate of penetration varied throughout the different rock types and formations but averaged 158 feet per hour throughout the vertical section. Gas averaged 90 units with a maximum reading of 785 units in the Mission Canyon and also in the Lodgepole Formation. The Pioneer 74 ﬂex rig reached kick off point at 12:00 AM CST on March 2, 2015 at 10,752 feet. <br/>Base of Last Salt 9,698’ MD 9, 68 7’ TVD - 7,25 7’ SS <br/>The Base of Last Salt marker was encountered at a measured depth of 9,698 feet, 11 feet high to the prognosis. It was picked at the base of a slight heat up in gamma at 9,698 feet MD. Samples also changed from salt that was clear and translucent to off white anhydrite. The lithology of the Base of Last Salt was mainly gray to light gray limestone and off white anhydrite with even yellow white ﬂuorescence and weak slow cuts. Rate of penetration was an average of 162 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 100 units with a maximum of 2 13 units through the Base of Last Salt. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,899 ’ MD 9,88 7’ TVD - 7,45 7’ SS </p>

The lithology of the Mission Canyon Formation was limestone that ranged in color from cream tan to gray to light gray and cream gray that produced even ﬂuorescence and weak cuts.

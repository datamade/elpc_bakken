It was picked by a low to high gamma signature from 10,412 feet to 10,414 feet MD. The lithology of the Lodgepole Formation was mainly limestone that was gray, tan gray, and light gray with an even green ﬂuorescence and weak cuts. Rate of penetration was an average of 88 ﬂ/hr.

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The curve was started at 11:00 AM CST on March 2, 2015 with an 8 3%. inch BHI curve bit and a NOV 2.38 degree mud motor targeting the Middle Bakken Formation with an initial target TVD of 11,263 feet and 15 feet into the Middle Bakken Formation. The Sondrol 11-3HU gamma markers were correlated to the Sondrol 11-3TFH and Sondrol 11-3—2H gamma data. Baker Hughes directional team started the curve with an average built rate of 11.5 degrees per 100 feet needed. The decision was made to TOOH for insufﬁcient build rates at 4:20 PM CST on March 2, 2015 at 11126' MD. Drilling resumed at 6:45 AM CST on March 3, 2015 with a Security bit and 2.5 degree mud motor. The decision was made to TOOH for insufﬁcient build rates at 9:00 AM CST on March 3, 2015 at 11212‘ MD. Drilling resumed at 10:40 PM CST on March 3, 2015 with the same Security bit as the previous run, teamed with a 2.75 degree mud motor. The decision was made to TOOH for insufficient build rates at 1:50 AM CST on March 4, 2015 at 11308' MD. Drilling resumed at 1:30 PM CST on March 4, 2015 with a Smith tri-cone bit and a 2.75 degree mud motor. While correlating gamma signatures between Sondrol 11—3TFH and Sondrol 11—3-2H, the ideal landing target ﬂuctuated between 11,264 feet and 11,277 feet TVD throughout the seven Lodgepole Formation gamma markers. With the vast variation in recommended landing targets while correlating gamma signatures, the target was changed to 11,271 feet TVD aﬁer Lodgepole gamma marker number 6 and remained the ideal target for the remainder of the build section. <br/>False Bakken 11,322’ MD 11,231 ’ T VD -8,801 ’ SS <br/>The False Bakken Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,322 feet, 13 feet high to the prognosis. The pick of the False Bakken was primarily done off gamma correlation to the Sondrol 11—3 TFH curve gamma. The lithology of the False Bakken Formation was limestone that was brown, light brown, and light gray with a bright light green ﬂuorescence and a ﬂash milky light yellow blue cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 28 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 376 units with a maximum of 1784 units through the False Bakken Formation. <br/>Upper Bakken 11,34 7’ MD 11,242 ’ T VD -8, 812 ’ SS </p>

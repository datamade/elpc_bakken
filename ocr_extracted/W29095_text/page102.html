Drill rates in the Lodgepole averaged 0.82 minutes per foot rotating. Samples were primarily limestone, light to medium gray brown, medium to dark gray, light grey in part, trace cream, off-white, crypto to microcrystalline, massive to blocky in habit, platy in part, moderately hard to soﬂ, trace to no visible porosity, pinpoint yellow ﬂuorescence, thin streaming cuts. Trace dark brown shale layers were observed in the beginning and towards the bottom of the formation. KOP was reached at 10,465’ MD. Oil shows were present in sample throughout the Lodgepole but more prominent shows towards the bottom of the Lodgepole, however there was no return ﬂow over the shakers. Gas ranged from 34 to 9272 total units. <br/>Curve & Tangent 1 0, 465 ’ — 12, 050’ MD <br/>The second sequence of P Vance 154-97-14—9-21—14H3 was to trip out of the hole and change BHA’s to begin drilling the curve of the well. We began drilling the curve on January 17, 2015 at 10,465’ MD. Drilling times in the Lodgepole below KOP averaged 1.11 minutes per foot sliding. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the Lodgepole to correlate to the pilot hole. At KOP we kept our target at 10,930’ TVD. We landed the curve at 12,050’ MD, 10,938.43’ TVD. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">False Bakken 1 0, 858 ’MD 1 0, 800’ T VD 8,691 ’ SS <br/>The False Bakken came in nine feet higher than prognosis at 10,858’ MD, 10,800’ TVD. The False Bakken was picked by the large spike in gamma at the base of the Lodgepole. Samples of limestone became much darker and argillaceous in this zone. Upon reaching the False Bakken we knew the rough thicknesses of each formation before reaching our Three Forks target, thus we kept our landing target to 10,930’ TVD. <br/>Scallion 10,862 ’ 1WD 10,802 ’ T VD 8, 693 ’ SS <br/>The Scallion was reached at 10,862’ MD, 10,802’ TVD. With the depth that the False Bakken came in, the Scallion came in as expected as far as the formation top was concerned. Samples were medium dark gray limestone, microcrystalline, and slightly carbonaceous, blue ﬂuorescence, instant streaming thick yellow cut. Gas reached an excess of 1010 units. <br/>Upper Bakken 10,877’ MD 10,813 ’ T VD 8, 704’ SS </p>

Upon entering the Upper Bakken shale gas raised in excess of 1500 total units. Background gas was consistently from 499 to 1700 units in the package. A typical sample was shale, black, very dark gray, gray, dark brown, brown, ﬁrm to brittle, ﬁssile, massive, carbonaceous, waxy, </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Wiley 6—25H1 was drilled as a single lateral horizontal well on an eight well Eco-pad in Section 25 T150N R97W and ending in Section 36 T150N R97W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The target formation was the Three Forks 1St Bench. The surface location was set at 775’ FNL & 1,575’ FEL in section 25 and had ending coordinates of 236.62' FSL & 1,003.68' FEL of section 36. Drilling began on February <br/>27, 2015 and drilled to a TD of 20,355’ MD was reached at 1:05 am CT on March 16, 2015. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Wellsite geological services consisted of two mudloggers. A Noram gas detecting system with chromatograph was utilized. Samples were caught at 30’ intervals from 8,517’ to TD of 20,355’ MD. All samples were saved and boxed to be sent to the State of North Dakota. <br/>Charles 8,51 7’ MD 8,514 ’ T VD -6,241 ’ SS <br/>The Charles formation was picked off sample and drilling change. The Charles formation was salt, translucent, white, milky white, hard, brittle in part, massive, with intermittent stringers of anhydrite, white, light gray, amorphous, soﬁ. At approximately 7,523’ samples changed to limestone, light brown, tan, yellow brown, cream, crypto to microcrystalline, moderate to very calcareous, slightly argillaceous, ﬁrm to slightly soft, dolomitic in part, with frequent beds of salt observed. After the Base Last at 9,153’ MD, 9,150’ TVD (-6,877’ SS) samples returned to limestone, brown, dark brown, gray brown, crypto to microcrystalline, fossiliferous at times, very to moderately calcareous, argillaceous at times, ﬁrm to slightly soﬁ, very dolomitic at times. Intervals of very poor intergranular porosity were observed and very slow streaming ﬂuorescing cuts at times. Gas ranged from 6 to 22 units. At 9,260’ MD a trip was made for an MWD failure. There was no trip gas seen from this trip. The top of the Charles came in 2’ low to prognosis while the Base Last Salt also came in 2’ low. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,3 70’ MD 9,36 7’ T VD - 7, 094’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was picked off sample and drilling change and was limestone, dark brown, brown, minor light brown, microcrystalline, calcitic at times, moderately calcareous, moderately argillaceous, silty, ﬁrm to slightly hard, dolomitic at times, with intervals of poor intergranular porosity observed and very slow to fast streaming ﬂuorescing cuts at times. Gas ranged from 14 to 71 units. The Mission Canyon came in 7’ low to prognosis. <br/>Lodgepole 9, 92 7’ MD 9,923 ’ T V1) -7,65 0’ SS </p>

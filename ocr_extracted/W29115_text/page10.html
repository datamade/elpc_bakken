The project was designed in conformance with LRMP direction. <br/>A Finding of No Signiﬁcant Impact (FONSI) has been prepared based upon analysis summarized in the EA, and is incorporated into this document. I determined these actions will not have a signiﬁcant effect on the quality of the human environment, and an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will not be prepared. <br/>National Environmental Policy Act: The EA and Decision Notice/Finding of No Signiﬁcant Impact document are in compliance with NEPA and the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1500-1508) for Implementing NEPA. <br/>Clean Water Act, Executive Order 11990 (wetlands) and 11988 (ﬂoodplains): No impacts to wetlands, groundwater resources, or ﬂoodplains would occur as a result of the implementation of the Proposed Action (see EA, Section 3.3). <br/>Executive Order 12898, “Environmental Justice”: This decision was assessed to determine whether it will disproportionately impact minority or low-income populations. No minority or low-income populations were identiﬁed during public involvement activities. The decision will not amend or preclude any existing private or treaty rights in the project area. <br/>National Historic Preservation Act: The project area has been surveyed for heritage resources. Based on designed criteria and avoidance mitigation and consultation concurrence from the State Historic Preservation Ofﬁce, all eligible sites can be avoided or have been mitigated by the proposed Project, no effects to National Register eligible or listed heritage resources will occur <br/>(see EA, Section 3.6). <br/>Migratory Bird Treaty Act: This decision is consistent with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (see EA, Section 3.5). <br/>Endangered Species Act (ESA): This decision is consistent with the Endangered Species Act. The USFWS lists six Threatened and Endangered species listed for McKenzie County, one proposed threatened, one candidate species, and critical habitat for two of these species. A ﬁnding of “No Impact” was found for six of these species or their habitat, and a ﬁnding of “No Impact” for critical habitat. A determination that the Project would not adversely affect, contribute appreciably to cumulative effect, or jeopardize the continued existence of any species was found for the interior least tern, whooping crane, piping plover, and Dakota skipper (see EA, Section 3.5). <br/>Regional Forester’s Sensitive Species: In the Biological Evaluation prepared for this project a <br/>  <br/>—— Decision Notice and Finding of No Significant Impact — </p>

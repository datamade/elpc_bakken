Fly ash and Omnisource drying pellets were applied to the remaining contents of the pit and mechanically mixed to ensure proper solidification. Glean fill material may be homogeneously mixed to achieve adequate solidification. Upon solidiÔ¨Åcation, existing pit liner was cut from the surface of the pad and buried within the excavation. At least four feet of fill material was backfilled in this excavation; onsite spoil pile will provide necessary overburden. Backfilled material was tracked with equipment to ensure compaction and reduce potential for settling.

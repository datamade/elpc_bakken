A determination of “may impact individuals or habitat, but not likely to lead to a trend toward federal listing” was made for alkali sacaton, alyssum-leaved phlox, Baird’s span‘ow, blue lips, Dakota buckwheat, lanceleaf cottonwood, loggerhead Shrike, long-billed curlew, Missouri foxtail cactus, nodding wild buckwheat, Neithern redbelly dace, ottoe skipper, regal ﬁ'itillary, sand lily, smooth goosefoot, Sprague’s pipit, tawny crescent, Torrey’s Cryptantha, Townsend’s daisy, and bald eagle (see EA, Sections 3.4 and 3.5). <br/>Management Indicator Species (MIS): Consistent with regulations at 36 CFR 219.19, both alternatives were evaluated for potential impacts (direct, indirect and cumulative) to habitats for three management indicator species. The Project will have no effect on the black-tailed prairie dog or greater sage grouse. Sharp-tailed grouse are common in the Project area. A determination of“may impact individuals or their habitat; however, it is not likely to contribute to a trend toward federal listing or loss of viability to the population or species” was made based on the stipulation of avoiding construction activities between March 1 and J unc 15 in any given year and/or conducting surveys (see EA, Section 3.5). <br/>National Forest Management Act: The selected alternative complies with the goals, objectives and direction contained in the LRMP. The project incorporates all applicable standards and guidelines and management area prescriptions (see EA, Section 3). <br/>Executive Order 13112 (Invasive Species): Both alternatives comply with this order directing Federal Agencies, whose actions may affect the status of invasive species, to prevent the introduction of invasive species, and detect and respond rapidly to, and control populations of, such species in a cost-effective and environmentally-sound manner as appropriations allow. Noxious weeds would be controlled pursuant to the DPG Noxious Weed EIS (see EA, Section <br/>3.4.4). </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">FINDING OF NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT <br/>The signiﬁcance of environmental impacts must be considered in terms of context and intensity. This means that the signiﬁcance of an action must be analyzed in several contexts such as society as a whole (human and national), the affected region, the affected interests, and the locality. Signiﬁcance varies with the setting of the proposed action. In the case of a site-speciﬁc action, signiﬁcance usually depends upon the effects in the locale rather than in the world as a whole. Intensity refers to the severity of degree of impact. (40 CFR 1508.27) <br/>CONTEXT <br/>This project is a site-speciﬁc action that by itself does not have international, national, regionwide, or statewide importance. The discussion of the signiﬁcance criteria that follows applies to the intended action and is within the context of local importance in the area associated with the Tarpon Federal 24-20, Tarpon Federal 44-19, Helsingborg Federal 153-96-22-27, and Sand Creek Federal 153-96-21-28 Oil and Gas Wells, Access Road, and Utilities project. <br/>INTENSITY <br/>The intensity of effect was considered in terms of the following: <br/>— Decision Notice and Finding of No Significant Impact — </p>

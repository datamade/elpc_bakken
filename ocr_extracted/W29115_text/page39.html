Fences will be 4 strands, 121/2 gauge (minimum) barbed wire with horizontal design corner and line braces. Steel posts will be used in the fenceline where terrain is fairly level. On slopes greater than 2:1 (50% slope) there will be 1 wood post for every 3 steel posts. Gates (14 feet minimum) are required. <br/>Braces Corner Braces: will be installed whenever a horizontal change in fence direction occurs. Corner braces will consist of 3 upright posts and 2 horizontal poles. Corner braces for segments on slopes 2:1 or greater, will consist of 5 upright posts and 4 horizontal poles. <br/>Line Braces: will be installed when vertical changes occur. Line braces will consist of 2 upright posts and 1 horizontal pole. <br/>Gate Braces: Gate braces will consist of 2 upright posts and 1 horizontal pole on each side of the gate. Gate sticks will be wooden, round, and a minimum of 2 inches on the small end. Smooth wire will be used for all bales on the ground posts, as well as the loop for opening the gate. <br/>Upright Posts (wood): All upright brace posts will have a minimum diameter of 6 inches and a minimum length of 8 feet and shall be set at a minimum depth of 42 inches and tamped firmly. Fill is to be tamped in 6 inch lifts. <br/>Horizontal Poles: All horizontal wooden brace (poles) will be a minimum diameter of4 inches and a minimum length of 8 feet. <br/>Brace Wires and Twists: Number 9 smooth wire will be used between brace posts and twisted tight, leaving a twist stick (wood, rod, or pipe) inserted in the center of the twist. Twist sticks will be 18 to 24 inches in length. <br/>Wires and Spacing <br/>Barbed Wire: The barbed wire will be a minimum 121/2 gauge. Wire must be taut with due consideration for contraction and expansion. Wire should never be kinked or nicked. Staples should hold the wire close to the post. No more than % mile of wire is to be stretched at one time. Dead end on corners and gates on the end of the brace opposite from direction of pull with wire ends wrapped around posts twice and twisted back on stretched wire. Barbed wire will not be used for purposes other than the—top 3 main strands. Smooth wire of the same gauge shall be used for the bottom strand. <br/>Barbed Wire Spacing: Wire spacing from the ground up will be: 1st strand (smooth) at 16 inches, 2nd strand at 22 inches, 3rd strand at 28 inches, and 4th strand at 40 inches. <br/>Depressions: Where fences cross depressions, extra wires may be needed. Wires crossing depressions shall be weighted down with rocks and tie-downs to take the strain off the staples and posts. <br/>Smooth Wire: Excluding the 4 main strands and the 4 strands on individual gates, #9 smooth wire will be used for all other wire needs including but not limited to braces, gates, anchors, etc. <br/>Fence (Non-Brace) Posts: All posts will be in a straight line between stretch stations or brace sections and spaced 161/2 feet apart. Fence post height is 48 inches excluding braces. Wood posts will be a minimum length of 6% feet and a minimum diameter of 3 inches at the small end and firmly set a minimum of 30 inches in the ground. Steel posts will be set at a depth so that the anchor plates (flanges or fins) will be at <br/>least 3—4 inches below ground surface. </p>

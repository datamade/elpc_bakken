    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">DECISION RATIONALE <br/>The purpose of this proposal is to allow Whiting and Newﬁeld to exercise their federal lease rights in the development of the proposed Tarpon Federal 24-20, Tarpon Federal 44—19, Helsingborg Federal 153-96-22-27, and Sand Creek Federal 153-96-21-28. Federal mineral leases include NDM—95556, NDM-97025, and NDM-97026 for the Tarpon Federal 24-20, NDM-95556 and NDM-95557 for the Tarpon Federal 44-19H, NDM-32962 and NDM-95180 for the Helsingborg Federal 153-96-22-27, and NDM-95180, NDM-951 81 , NDM-95177, and NDM-97026 for the Sand Creek Federal 153-96-21-28. <br/>In making the decision to authorize the Tarpon Federal 24-20, Tarpon Federal 44-19, Helsingborg Federal 153-96-22-27, and Sand Creek Federal 153-96-21-28 oil and gas wells, access roads, and utilities, I reviewed the existing environmental conditions and the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects for the proposal and the No Action alternative. I considered comments received from interested parties and considered how each alternative: 1) met the purpose and need, 2) responded to the issue, and 3) addressed public comments. <br/>The selected alternative best meets the purpose and need of both developing oil and gas resources and honoring valid existing lease rights on the Dakota Prairie Grasslands (DPG) while ensuring protection of federal surface resources. <br/>In the course of making my decision, I considered the LRMP and information provided by the Forest Service specialists. My decision was also based on the following points: <br/>a The Finding of No Signiﬁcant Impact from the conclusion of the Tarpon Federal 24-20, Tarpon Federal 44-19, Helsingborg Federal 153-96-22-27, and Sand Creek Federal 153- <br/>96-21-28 Oil and Gas Wells, Access Roads, and Utilities EA. o Compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. <br/>The Tarpon Federal 24-20, Tarpon Federal 44-19, Helsingborg Federal 153-96-22-27, and Sand Creek Federal 153-96-21-28 Oil and Gas Wells, Access Roads, and Utilities EA documents the environmental analysis and conclusions upon which this decision is based. </p>

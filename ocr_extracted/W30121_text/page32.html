    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Lateral drilling resumed at 4:30 PM CST on the 9TH of February, with drill rates while rotating averaging between 170 and 200 feet per hour, and background gas averaging 392 units. The wellbore descended to the base of the target window with gamma continuing to remain homogenous throughout the day. Anticipated dip rate remained 90.55 degrees A trip began shortly before 12:00 AM CST on the 10TH of February due to an apparent failed mud motor. <br/>A new mud motor was picked up, and tripped in the hole. Lateral drilling resumed at 12:00 PM CST on the 10TH of February Drill rates averaged between 220 and 240 feet per hour. Background gas averaged 414 units, with a trip gas of 640 units circulated with bottoms up. The wellbore descended through the base of the target window, and remained under the window for the duration of the drilling day, rising to just below the base as of morning report of the 11TH of February. An additional trip was performed due to a ﬁled MWD tool beginning at 11:30 PM CST on the 10TH of February. <br/>The MWD tool was replaced, and tripping in began at 6:30 AM CST on the morning of the 11TH of February. Lateral drilling resumed at 12:30 PM CST, with drill rates while rotating averaging between 270 and 300 feet per hour, and 40 to 70 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 475 units, with a 2,125 unit trip gas circulated with bottoms up. A very slight correlative gamma marker appeared, and the top of the window was set at this marker, and a slightly shallower dip rate of 90.36 degrees was observed between 14,770 and 15,880 feet measured depth, increasing again to the anticipated 90.57 degrees following. As of the morning report on the 12TH of February, the wellbore was just above the base of the target window. <br/>Through the drilling day of the 12TH of February, drill rates averaged between 240 and 270 feet per hour while rotating, and from 60 to 70 feet per hour while sliding. Backgron gas averaged 586 units. Correlative gamma markers again indicated a ﬂatter than anticipated dip rate between 16,000 and 19,000 feet measured depth. The wellbore exited the base of the target window between 16,600 and 17,300 feet measured depth. The wellbore remained within the target window through 19,250 feet measured depth, where it exited the top of the window and approached the C facies. Anticipated dip rate at this point was 90.69 degrees. <br/>On the drilling day of the 13TH of February, drill rates averaged between 260 and 300 feet while rotating, and from 50 to 60 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 620 units. Following corrective slides, the wellbore returned to the top of the target window following 19,920 feet measured depth. Correlated dip rate based on the slight marker at the top of the target window confirmed 90.69 degrees. The wellbore was just above the base of the target window as of morning <br/>report of the 14TH of February. Began circulating while waiting on a wireline truck to run gyro surveys of the wellbore at 12:00 PM CST on the 13TH of February. <br/>An initial truck arrived on location at 3:30 PM C ST, but the wireline size was incorrect to run the gyro tool. Continued circulating through 10:00 PM CST, when the correct truck arrived on location. The tool was pumped to bottom, and gyro surveys began shortly after 6:00 AM CST on the morning of the 14TH of February, and was completed shortly aﬁer 1:00 PM CST. The survey ﬁle was processed 0111‘ site, and was e-mailed to location at 6:00 PM CST. Lateral drilling resumed at 6:30 PM CST. The wellbore reached TD just below the base of the target window. <br/>The Bartleson #11-19—2H Middle Bakken horizontal leg reached a total depth of 20,295 feet measured depth at 8:00 PM CST on Saturday, February 14TH, 2015, 19 days from spud, at 2,506 feet from the north line, and 271 feet from the east line of the SE NE ‘/4 of Section 20, Township 153N, Range 92W, Mountrail County, North Dakota. <br/>Derek Lidstrom, Wellsite Mudlogger </p>

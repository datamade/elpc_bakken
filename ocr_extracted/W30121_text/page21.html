    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation’s Bartleson #11—19—2H is a horizontal Well targeting the Middle Bakken’s D facies, to be drilled in an east southeast direction at a vertical section azimuth of 103.23 degrees for approximately 10,338 feet vertical section. The well is located in the NW %, NW 1A, Section 19, Township 153N, Range 92W of Mountrail County, northwest of New Town, North Dakota. <br/>This well was spud in on January 26”, 2015 at 1:00 PM CST. Well site geological services began at 8,300 feet measured depth on January 31“, 2015, shortly before 1:00 PM CST. <br/>Ten, thirty, and ﬁfty-foot lagged samples were caught by mud loggers and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>A thirteen and one half inch wellbore was drilled to 2,126 feet measured depth, and nine and ﬁve eighths inch casing was run and set. The remaining vertical wellbore and curve was drilled, but due to the surface location of the well, and hardline setback, intermediate casing was not set until 12,843 feet measured depth. One 83/4 inch bit, and one six inch bit were used while drilling lateral number one, the six inch bit was re-ran twice. Total gas hotwire monitoring system was used for the duration of logging services. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Bartleson #1 l—l9-2H vertical wellbore, with original curve, reached a total depth of 10,704 feet measured depth at 9:00 AM CST on February 3RD, 2015, approximately 35 feet into the Middle Bakken, 8 days from spud. Following a trip to pick up a lateral assembly, horizontal leg began at 12:00 AM CST on February 4TH, 2015, reaching a total measured depth of 20,295 feet on February 15TH, 2015 at 8:00 PM CST, 19 days from spud. <br/>Began logging in the Charles Formation <br/>Logging services began at 8,300 feet measured depth in the Charles formation shortly before 1:00 PM CST on January 31“. Charles consisted primarily of anhydrite, limestone, and interlaminated dolomite. Drill rates ranged from 0.5—1.5 minutes per foot. Background gas averaged 11 units. Due to low gas readings, a successful bump test was performed at the shakers. Base of the last salt was picked at 8,575 feet measured depth, 8,574 feet true vertical depth using MWD gamma data. Samples following consisted primarily of beds of anhydrite, limestone, and minor dolomite, with interbedded shale through the Mission Canyon. <br/>Mission Canyon 8, 752’ MD 8, 751 ’ T VD -6, 778’ SS <br/>Mission Canyon was picked at 8,752 feet measured depth using MWD gamma data. The Mission Canyon consisted of predominantly light to medium cream gray, microcrystalline, fairly argillaceous limestone, off white to cream white anhydrite and light tan brown, tan. microcrystalline dolomite. Even white mineral ﬂuorescence and slow, pinpoint streaming cut present in some samples caught. Background gas averaged 11 to 22 units through the Mission Canyon. <br/>Lodgepole 9,401 ’ MD 9,400’ TVD -7,42 7’ SS <br/>Lodgepole was picked at 9,401 feet measured depth using MWD gamma data. A minor change in sample coloring, from medium to dark brown, to light to medium gray, as well as a slight increase in porosity noted across the Lodgepole top. Drill rates averaged 1 minute per foot in the initial portion of the Lodgepole. Background gas averaged 11 to 22 units through the Lodgepole. </p>

A trip was performed at 9,690 feet measured depth at 8:00 AM CST on February 1“, 2015 to pick up the curve assembly, including a Halliburton MMDSSM bit and directional tools. The trip was completed, and after rotating 10 feet to 9,700 feet measured depth, the began building the curve at 11:00 PM CST on February IST, 2015. Drill rates averaged one to two minutes per foot through the curve. <br/>Correlations were made with the Bartleson #11-19H as well as the Bartleson #13-18—2TFX MWD gamma logs using seven individual Lodgepole correlative markers and formation tops. The initial landing target based on the geological prognosis was set at 10,264 feet measured depth. The indicated landing target based on correlative Lodgepole gamma markers was slightly shallower at 10,257 feet true vertical depth, and the target was raised to 10,260 feet true vertical depth following the False Bakken. Typical samples in the lower Lodgepole consisted of light to medium gray, brown, gray tan, cream, cream gray, medium tan to tan, light brown, very ﬁne to microcrystalline, slightly argillaeeous limestone, with trace anhydrite, and scattered light brown oil staining. </p>

Backgron gas averaged 700 units through the Upper Bakken. Samples consisted of dark gray to black, blocky, carbonaceous shale, with trace amounts of dolomite and limestone, with a scattered yellow green ﬂuorescence, and instant cloudy, <br/>slow streaming yellow green cut, with cut drying to a good yellow gold ﬂuorescence halo, and under white light, gradually turning strong amber. </p>

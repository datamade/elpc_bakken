The wellbore crossed the top of the target and continued to rise in true vertical depth. The gamma spiked to 139 API. Above the target window the samples contained about 1% of pyrite. Sliding succeed in bringing the wellbore down in true vertical depth and continue to drill in the top two feet of the window. Samples were generally described as sandstone: cream, off white, tan cream, very ﬁne grain, rare pyrite, subrounded, moderately sorted, dolomitic cement, 10% light <br/>gray siltstone, 20% light blue shale, pyritic, platy, ﬁssile; fair porosity, patchy pinpoint ﬂuorescence, blue green cut with faint streamers. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">At 11,570’ measured depth, the clean gamma was seen indicating the wellbore crossed the set line. The wellbore continued to drill in the clean gamma which is located in the bottom 8’ of the target window until 11,845’ measured depth. This gamma contact point was used to estimate the dip to be 89.89 degrees. Between 11,571’ to 11,845’ the samples were generally described as a light tan sandstone with varying amounts of shale and siltstone. The overall porosity was fair to good with a milky yellow streaming cut. Drilling rates ranged from 0.23 to 1.6 minutes per foot and averaged 0.54 minutes per foot. Gamma ranged from 39 to 78 API and averaged 59 API. Total gas ranged from 180 to 466 units and averaged 369 units. <br/>At 11,845’ measured depth, the set line was crossed and the hot ratty gamma was encountered. Drilling continued in the hotter gamma until 12,313’. Here is clean gamma was seen and used to estimate the dip to be 90.17 degrees. The wellbore continued to drill in the lower part of the target zone until 13,515’ measured depth. The interval of 12,313’ to 13,515’ rate of penetration ranged from 0.23 to 1.95 minutes per foot and averaged 0.40 minutes per foot. Total gas averaged 364 units. Gamma ranged from 41 to 106 API and averaged 67 API. The samples were generally described as sandstone: cream, cream tan, translucent, very ﬁne, subrounded, well to moderately sorted, poorly cemented, dolomitic cement; 5% shale, light blue green; scattered siltstone; rare pyrite; good porosity; scattered green ﬂuorescence, cloudy green faint streaming cut. <br/>At 13,515’ measured depth, the wellbore crossed the set line and the hot ratty gamma was encountered. The wellbore continued to rise in true vertical depth and went out the top. Sliding succeed in bringing the wellbore back into the target window. The wellbore continued to drop in true vertical depth and crossed the set line at 13.848’ measured depth. Here is clean gamma was encountered and used to estimate the dip to be 90.31 degrees. Samples in the bottom target window were generally described as a cream sandstone with varying percentages of shale and siltstone. Overall with a good porosity and a fair streaming cut. 44 to 83 API and averaged 60 API. Total gas ranged from 152 to 466 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.30 to 1.57 minutes per foot and averaged 0.45 minutes per foot. <br/>The wellbore continued to drop in true vertical depth and the Aquitard was encountered at 14,273’ measured depth. Gamma spiked to 174 API. Sliding succeed in bringing the wellbore out of the Aquitard and the clean gamma was seen at 14,678’. Samples in the Aquitard were generally described as sandstone: cream, light tan, off white, translucent, very ﬁne, subrounded to subangular, moderately sorted, poorly </p>

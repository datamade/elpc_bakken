    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation’s Kaldahl 34-12TFH is located in the NWNE of Section 13 T156N R97W in Williams County, North Dakota, drilled as a multi well pad with the Kaldahl 44—12TFH, G. Bergstrom 31-13TFH, and G. Bergstrom 4113TFH. The Kaldahl 34-12TFH is a horizontal well with the two mile lateral across sections 12 and 1, targeting the Three Forks. Bottom hole location is in the NENW of Section 1 T156N R97W. The Kaldahl 34-12TFH was spudded November 20, 2014 at 2:30 pm and reached a total measured depth of 21,340’ on January 8‘“, 2015 at 8:30 am. Wellsite geological services provided by Matt McHugh and Jennifer Meidinger of Neset Consulting Service began at 7,150’. Jessica Stark and Jennifer Meidinger provided wellsite geological services for the lateral. A Total Gas Detection system was utilized for gas analysis. Samples were caught every thirty feet throughout the vertical and curve and every ﬁﬁy feet throughout the lateral, as well as intermediate samples when necessary. One set of samples was washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 7,150’ —9,450’MD Logging services began at 7,150’ measured depth in the lower Amsden at 2:33 pm <br/>on December 10", 2014. The lower Amsden consisted of cream red anhydrite with light red brown siltstone. <br/>Tyler 7,1 79’ MD 7,169’ T VD -4,934’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The top of the Tyler marker was picked using gamma. The Tyler came in 7’ high to the prognosis. The ﬁrst sample in the Tyler was a light red anhydrite with trace amounts of red siltstone. As drilling continued the samples transitioned to a brick red ﬁssile shale. Overall the Tyler had poor porosity and little oil shows. Total gas ranged from 140 to 241 units and averaged 174 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.17 to 2.13 minutes per foot and averaged 0.78 minutes per foot. <br/>Kibbey Lime 7, 720’ MD 7, 709 ’ T VD -5,4 74 ’ SS <br/>The Kibbey Lime was picked at a drop in gamma and the sample change from a reddish siltstone to a cream gray limestone. The Kibbey came in 4’ high to the prognosis. <br/>Charles 7,885 ’ MD 7,8 74’ T VD -5, 639’ SS <br/>The top of the Charles was picked using sample and gamma. The Charles came in even to the prognosis. Samples changed from brick red sandstone to salt. A total of three salt beds, along with beds of dolomite and limestone, were encountered in the Charles formation. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.23 to 2.46 minutes per foot and averaged 0.78 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 157 to 258 units and averaged 176 units. </p>

A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Light gray brown, medium gray, cream gray, wackestone to packstone, slightly argillaceous, ANHDRITE: 30% cream gray, white, gummy, poor to moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered dull yellow fluorescence, good cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Rival 9,990 ’ 1WD 9,982 ’ TVD - 7,329 ' SS <br/>The Rival Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,990’ and a true vertical depth of 9,982’, which was one foot higher than the prognosis. The Rival was picked using gamma signatures and lithology changes. The samples in the upper portion of the Rival were as follows; LIMESTONE: Gray, medium to dark gray brown, light brown, micritic to packstone, slightly argillaceous, carbonaceous in part, 15% off white anhydrite, poor to moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, spotty dull yellow white ﬂuorescence, fair cloudy yellow cut. </p>

The Lodgepole Formation was picked from using gamma signatures along with a lithology changes. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Light to medium gray, light gray brown, off white, wackestone to packstone, argillaceous, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered yellow white <br/>ﬂuorescence, cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Curve 10,990— 11,840’ MD <br/>The curve was started at a kick off point of 10,990’ measured depth, 467’ below the Lodgepole. The bit and bottom hole assembly were changed out for a directional assembly at 10,990’ measured depth for drilling the curve. Penetration rates of the curve averaged 60 — 80 ft/hr while sliding. The BHA was pulled on December 23, 2014 due to slow ROP. The BHA #4 was changed out at 1 1,125’. The maximum trip gas was 1,547 units. The Curve was landed on December 24, 2014 at 9:30 P.M. CST, 25 feet into the Three Forks Formation at a true vertical depth of 1 1,516.56’. Casing was completed on December 26, 2014. Seven inch 35# weight casing was set to a measured depth of 1 1,820 feet and cement ﬁlled the remainder of the wellbore down to the curve landing measured depth of 11,840 feet. <br/>False Bakken 11,428" MD 11,366’ TVD - 8, 713 ’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 11,428’ and a true vertical depth of I 1,366 feet. The lithology of the False Bakken consisted of limestone. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Dark gray, gray tan, charcoal dark gray, trace of shale, scattered tan, ﬁrm, tight, argillaceous in part, fair to poor intergranular porosity, patchy bright yellow fluorescence, instant pinpoint streaming, good cloudy yellow cut. </p>

Once ﬁnish grade was established, a milling machine was used to combine commercial grade Portland cement with sub-grade. The milling machine pulverized and mixed the soil and cement together at a depth of 8". Water was added to milling process, as necessary. to meet <br/>optimum moisture content of soil. <br/>Once milling process was complete, a smooth drum roller compacted milled material into place. A motor grader then established ﬁnal surface grade. <br/>Affected area was then left untouched for approximately 24 hours to allow for curing process of treated area. <br/>  <br/>     <br/>      <br/>FOR STATE USE ONLY <br/>Hess Bakken Investments II, LLC 701-420-6900 3015 16th Street SW, Suite 20 <br/>City W Zip Code <br/>Minot 58701 <br/>Signature _/\' Printed Name W Mrﬁﬁ RACHELLE TRIELOFF <br/>Title Date Senior Re ulatory Technician March 6, 2015 <br/>Email Address rtrieloff@hess.com <br/>    <br/>          <br/>     <br/>       </p>

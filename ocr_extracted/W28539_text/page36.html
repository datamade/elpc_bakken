Drainage: The well site shall be constructed, maintained, and removed in a manner which provides drainage adequate to maintain the existing natural flow. Structures including but not limited to cross drains, culverts, dikes, and ditches, shall be installed where necessary to maintain the natural flow and to stabilize erosion. If an erosion problem develops, the necessary actions shall be taken to correct it and any erosion damage shall be repaired. <br/>4. Reclamation: Any well site abandonment plans shall be subject to written approval of the ND Department of Trust Lands, prior to implementation. Upon abandonment of the herein authorized well site, the reserved soil shall be salvaged from the well site, backslopes and ﬁll slopes; gravel or scoria shall be removed; the well site shall be completely obliterated and recontoured to conform to the adjacent natural terrain; and the reserved soil shall be evenly respread on the disturbed areas. <br/>5. Revegetation: All disturbed soil surfaces resulting from construction, maintenance, or reclamation of the herein authorized well site, shall be revegetated with a mixture of native perennial grasses listed in Exhibit "D" sufficient to prevent accelerated erosion and restore, as closely as possible, the original long-term productivity. The use of any other seed mixtures shall be subject to the prior written approval of the ND Department of Trust Lands. Reclamation shall not be deemed completed until erosion is controlled, the surface is revegetated with a mixture of native grasses, and written approval is issued by the ND Department of Trust Lands. <br/>q:\5uppurtlafc\l’lln\suﬂuoe damn: agraemmewessa kndlak aiJl‘gaanc W </p>

Throughout the day directional had been working on keeping the wellbore at or above 90.5 degrees to allow the wellbore to build in TVD to see the a repeat in the C to A faces in the target window. After getting around 91 to 91.5 degrees and not seeing the clean-up in gamma it appeared that the formation had steepened from 90.1 degrees to 90.3 degrees. At 16,270’ MD the Mud Motor experienced multiple differential pressure spikes and the decision was made to TOOH at 16,275’ after drilling ceased. After the TOOH was complete a new Bit, Mud Motor and MWD tool were picked up and the TIH began. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 200 — 250 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 50 - 70 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 200 — 300 units with connection gases reaching as high as 1,498 units. The samples seen throughout the day continued to exhibit a cream tan/cream gray tan dolomite with traces of limestone and siltstone present and an even to spotty dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and an instant streaming to milky yellow green cut. <br/>Day4 16,275’—18,950’MD <br/>Drilling resumed yesterday with the wellbore tracking the lower portion of the Middle Bakken target window. As the wellbore slowly built in TVD towards the upper portion of the Middle Bakken target window the upper warm gamma from the A faces contact was seen indicating that the formation had begun to head down section at around 89.8 degrees. At 17,000’ MD the formation began to head back up section at 90.3 degrees placing the wellbore in the middle portion of the target window. Slides were done to keep the wellbore at or slightly above dip to continue tracking the Middle Bakken target window. The formation then ﬂattened slightly from 90.3 to 90.09 degrees placing the wellbore out of the top of the target interval. Slides were then done to work on dropping the wellbore in TVD to re—enter the top of the target window. At a MD of 18,950’ while trying to slide down problems were experienced with the Mud Motor and the decision was made to TOOH. Penetration rates with the new assembly averaged around 300 - 320 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 70 — 80 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 600 — 800 units with connection gases reaching as high as 8,503 units while running through the gas buster with a 6’ to 12’ ﬂare seen while drilling. The samples seen throughout the day continued to exhibit a cream tan/light to medium tan dolomite with traces of limestone and siltstone present and an even yellow green ﬂuorescence with a instant streaming to milky yellow green cut. <br/>Day 5 18,950’ —19, 783’ MD <br/>The TOOH began yesterday after experiencing problems with the Mud Motor, Once out of the hole a new Bit, Mud Motor and MWD tool were picked up and the TIH began. Drilling resumed through the Middle Bakken with the wellbore dropping in TVD back into the top of the target interval. At this time the formation had steepened and the </p>

Penetration rates through the False Bakken averaged around 120 - 130 ft/hr while sliding. The lithology of the False Bakken exhibited a mixture of light to medium gray limestone and traces of dark gray shale present. Background gases through the False Bakken increased to around 600 — 800 units. The False Bakken was evaluated while drilling ahead. <br/>Scallion 11,111 ’ MD 10,959 ’ TVD -8,816’ SS </p>

Aﬁer seeing the Scallion top the TVD target window remained at a true vertical depth of 11,001’ @ 90 degrees based off the isopaching from the Scallion to the Middle Bakken target area in the offset Cherry State wells. Penetration rates through the Scallion averaged around 100 - 120 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases increased to around 1,500 — 2,000 units with the samples showing a light to medium gray/cream gray tan limestone with moderate dark gray to black shale present. The Scallion was drilled through from 10,959‘ to 10,969’ true vertical depth. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 11,13 7’ MD 1 0,969 ’ TVD -8, 826 ’ SS <br/>The curve continued on through the remainder of the Scallion and the Upper Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,137’, true vertical depth of 10,969’, two feet low to prognosis. Once the Upper Bakken was encountered penetration rates increased from 100 ft/hr to around 200 - 250 ﬁlm while sliding and rotating. Background gases averaged around 1,500 — 2,000 units through the Upper Bakken with the samples showing a black/brown black carbonaceous shale with occasional limestone present. The Upper Bakken was drilled through and the Middle Bakken was encountered. </p>

The samples through the upper portion of the Middle Bakken exhibited a gray tan/gray brown dolomite with trace amounts of residual black shale, siltstone and limestone present. Background gases through the Middle Bakken averaged around 400 — 500 units. Drilling continued on with the curve through the Middle Bakken up to a MD of 11,319‘. The <br/>curve was landed around 7’ into the upper portion of the Middle Bakken with 89 degrees projected to the bit. <br/>The curve for the South lateral was landed at a measured depth of 11,319’ at 9:20 <br/>pm.

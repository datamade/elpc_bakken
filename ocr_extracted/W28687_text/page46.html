    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">EASEMENT: Oil and Gas Well Site <br/>19. <br/>20. <br/>21. <br/>22. <br/>23. 24. 25. <br/>26. <br/>27. <br/>28. <br/>ROW #7033 (Pg 3) <br/>rocks and evenly respread the reserved soil and reseed with a mixture of native grasses as speciﬁed in Exhibit "C". After seeding, the entire disturbed area shall be fenced to exclude livestock. Reclamation shall not be deemed completed until erosion is controlled, the surface is revegetated with a mixture of native grasses, and written approval is received from the ND Department of Trust Lands. Upon approval of reclamation by the ND Department of Trust Lands, this easement shall automatically terminate. <br/>GRANTEE shall implement reasonable measures to prevent accelerated erosion. If an erosion problem develops, GRANTEE shall promptly take the necessary actions to correct it and shall repair any erosion <br/>damage. <br/>Through this easement, GRANTEE is not acquiring any subsurface interest. Subsurface interests include, but are not limited to oil, gas, coal, cement materials, sodium sulfate, sand and gravel, scoria, road material, building stone, chemical substances, metallic ores, uranium ores, or colloidal or other clays. <br/>GRANTEE agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless GRANTOR from any claims by any person that are in any way related to GRANTEE's use of the easement area, including all costs, expenses, and attorney fees that in any manner result from or arise out of this agreement. It is GRANTEE's exclusive right and responsibility to construct, maintain, and remove the well site. GRANTEE further accepts liability and indemniﬁes GRANTOR, and its ofﬁcers and employees, from all costs, expenses and attorneys fees incurred in establishing and litigating the indemniﬁcation coverage provided above. The legal defense provided by GRANTEE to the GRANTOR under this paragraph must be free of any conﬂicts of interest, even if this requires GRANTEE to retain separate legal counsel for GRANTOR. The obligations of this paragraph shall continue after this agreement terminates. <br/>GRANTEE shall not discharge oil, gas liquids, salt water, or any other hazardous liquids or toxic substances onto the right-of-way or land adjacent to the right-of-way. All discharges of oil, gas liquids, salt water, or other hazardous liquids or toxic substances shall be stopped as soon as possible after discovery and acted upon immediately to halt movement of such discharges. Any such discharges shall be reported immediately to the GRANTOR. The GRANTEE shall then restore the affected area as closely as possible to its original condition. <br/>GRANTEE shall control all noxious weeds in the easement area. GRANTOR neither warrants nor agrees to defend title to the easement area. <br/>GRANTOR reserves the right to use the easement area and to allow others to use the easement area for purposes compatible with GRANTEE's use. If someone other than GRANTOR uses the easement area in a manner inconsistent with GRANTEE's use, GRANTOR is not liable or responsible. <br/>GRANTEE shall not assign or in any way transfer, in whole or in part, this easement or rights under it unless GRANTOR gives written consent. Any assignment or other transfer without GRANTOR's written consent is void <br/>and, at the GRANTOR's option, shall terminate this easement. <br/>This easement is subject to all existing easements and nothing in this easement supersedes any rights previously granted. <br/>This easement is also subject to the conditions in Exhibits "A", "B", & "C" which are attached and made a part of this easement. </p>

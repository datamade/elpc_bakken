It is a single lateral horizontal well targeting the middle Three Forks dolomite and blueish gray shale, drilled on a 2560—acre spacing unit. The well was spudded on January 6, 2015 and reached a total depth of 20,615’MD at 2:45 AM CDT on February 8, 2015. Clint Wold and Nevan Larson were onsite for Wellsite supervision, along with Scott Strahm and Stephanie Connolle representing Neset Consulting Service, Inc. for wellsite geological services. <br/>Wellsite services began at the logging depth of 7,800' MD, at 10:15 PM CDT, on January 10, 2014. Two man geological services were used for the vertical, curve and lateral. A Total Gas detector was utilized for gas analysis. Samples were caught every thirty feet throughout the vertical section and curve. Samples were caught every ﬁﬁy feet through the lateral. All samples caught were saved to be archived at the ND Core and Sample Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical Section <br/>The base of the last salt, the main correlatory marker to this point came in at 9,317’ MD and 9,315’ TVD, 17’ high to the prognosis. <br/>RADCLIFF 9,3 73 ’ MD 9,3 71 ’ T VD -7,306’ SS <br/>The Radcliff top was picked at 9,373’ MD and 9,371 ’ TVD a drop in ROP, from .37 min/ﬂ to .45 min/Pr a spike in differential pressure and torque and a change in sample texture and color. The Radcliff in 10' high of the prognosis and drilled consistently with ROP between .28 and .73 min/ft. Samples in the Radcliff were primarily blocky argillaceous limestone that was brown to gray brown with traces off white to light cream gray anhydrite and medium gray dolomite throughout. There were no signiﬁcant shows in the Radcliff. </p>

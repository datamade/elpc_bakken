Gamma ray markers early in the curve suggested a target of 10,215’ TVD but with the 2’ of anticipated structural difference the target was not raised. Gamma ray markers began suggesting a deeper target so the target was eventually lowered 4’ at the Middle Bakken. Upon drilling into the Three Forks, markers did not conﬂict with the new target of 10,221 ’ TVD so no additional changes were made. The ideal target was encounter 79’ into the formation at 10,221’ TVD. The curve landed at the ideal target but with an inclination of 890° at 10:00 am CDT on October 25, <br/>2014. Upper Bakken 10,060’ MD 10,034 ’ TVD -8,128 ’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was encountered at 10,060’ measured depth and 10,034’ true vertical depth. The isochore thickness of the shale was found to be 20’ during the curve, slightly thicker than expected. The drilling rate increased from about 50fph to 81fph as the bit entered the shale. Formation gas increased immediately after encountering the Upper Bakken with a high of 1 l 10 units and an average of 628 units. A sample from the Upper Bakken was described as a black to brown black, organic rich, blocky shale with very dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a strong milky blue white blooming cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,084 ’ MD 10,054 ’ T VD -8,I48 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at 10,084’ MD and a TVD of 10,054’. Upon drilling into the Middle Bakken, ROP slowed to an average of 47fph and gas dropped to an average of 370 units. Formation gas and oil shows were relatively good in the Middle Bakken. Samples were generally described as a gray tan silty and dolomitic sandstone with milky diffuse cuts. A sample from lower in the target window showed more prevalent calcitic cement than overlying stratum and interbedded siltstone <br/>was more COl’l'HI'lOD. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Lower Bakken 10,156’ MD 10,101 ’ TVD -8,195’SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale was encountered at 10,156’ measured depth and 10,101 ’ true vertical depth. The isochore thiclmess of the shale was found to be 37’, as expected. Four feet of silty shale was encountered between the Lower Bakken and Three Forks. This thin transition is often referred to as the Pronghorn Formation. The drilling rates increased from 47fph to 100fph once the wellbore entered the shale. Formation gas increased immediately after encountering the Lower Bakken with a high of 1017 units and an averaged 610 units. Samples from the Lower Bakken were described as a black to brownish black, very carbonaceous, gritty shale with yellow green ﬂuorescence and a strong milky blue white broad streaming cut. <br/>Three Forks 10,232 ’ MD 10,142 ’ T VD -8,23 6 ’SS <br/>The Three Forks Formation was encountered at 10,232’ MD and a TVD of 10,142’. Samples from the Three Forks Formation were described as a siltstone with varying amounts of clay, silt, sand and dolomite. The drilling rates decreased from 100fph to 41 fph once the wellbore entered the Three Forks. Formation gas decreased as the wellbore entered the less carbonaceous Three Forks with an average of just 250 units. Formation gas continued to decrease with depth. The Second Bench target top was encountered 65’ into the formation at a TVD of 10,207’. Samples from the warm gamma facies were generally a light green gray color with higher amounts of silt and clay. The samples with higher amounts of sand and dolomite were found in strata with low gamma readings (generally below 50 api). Above the Second Bench, speciﬁcally in the First Bench, samples had better oil shows and higher gas readings. The curve was completed at 2:15 am CDT on October 22, 2014 at 10,538’ MD. </p>

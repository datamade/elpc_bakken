    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Three Forks 11,334' MD 11,13 7' TVD -8,829' SS <br/>The Three Forks was next being observed. The Three Forks was picked based on gamma and samples. The samples changed to Dolomite: Light tan, tan, light brown, microcrystalline, moderate induration, soﬁ to ﬁrm, carbonaceous, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity, trace pyrite, 15% light green shale, even pinpoint dull yellow/green ﬂuorescence, slow thin streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.65 min/ﬁ and background gas was around 243 units, with a max of 402 units. The TD of the curve was reached at 11,488' MD on March 12, 2015 around 4:00 am CDT. The 7 Inch Casing was set at 11,461 MD, 11,159.4’ TVD. The curve was landed about 7’ feet into the target window. The samples consisted of Dolomite: Light brown, tan, light tan, microcrystalline, moderate induration, sandy, ﬁrm, carbonaceous, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity, trace micro—pyrite, even dull yellow/green ﬂuorescence, fair thin streaming cloudy cut. The target zone ranged between 15’ and 25’ feet below the top of the Three Forks formation. <br/>Lateral #1 11,488’ MD to 20, 925’ MD <br/>The rig reached bottom and began drilling ahead out of casing on March 14, 2015 around 2: 15 am CDT. The samples once they drilled out in the target window consisted of Dolomite: Tan, light tan, light brown, microcrystalline, microsucrosic, moderate induration, sandy, carbonaceous, trace pyrite, trace blue gray shale, fair intercrystalline porosity, even pinpoint dull yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming weak cloudy cut.The samples in the Internal 1 below the target window consisted of Dolomite: Light brown, tan, brown, microcrystalline, moderate induration, soﬁ to ﬁrm, carbonaceous, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity, trace pyrite, Shale: 45% light gray, gray, light green, even dull yellow/green ﬂuorescence, slow streaming weak cloudy cut. And the samples out the top of the target window consisted of Dolomite: Light tan, tan, brown, microcrystalline, moderate induration, ﬁrm, carbonaceous, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity, trace pyrite, Shale:30% light green, green—gray, even pinpoint dull yellow ﬂuorescence, slow thin streaming weak cloudy cut. The gamma API ranged between high 30’s to high 60’s in the clean zone, and out the top of the clean zone the gamma ranged between low 50’s to low 90’s. While the gamma API ranged between 100’s to mid 110’s in the Internal 1 Shale. <br/>The wellbore encountered the top of the clean at 11,770’ MD, 11,154.15’ TVD showing an estimated dip of 90.23 degrees. Based on the Current angle and markers seen the formation looks to be more leveled out. The dip was set at 90.1 degrees. The formation was projected out at 90.4 degrees. The wellbore then entered the clean zone at 12,600' MD / 11,153.8' TVD, which prompted a re-projection of the formation from a 90.4 degree dip to 90.1 degrees. The average rate of penetration was around 0.46 min/ﬂ and the background gases averaged 262 units with a max of 967 units. <br/>From 13,000’ MD to 15,000’ MD, the rate of penetration averaged 0.58 min/ﬂ. The background gases averaged 294 units with a max of 907 units. While drilling ahead <br/>in the clean zone the wellbore encountered a deﬂection, the wellbore exited into the Internal 1 at 13,195‘ MD / 11,157.9' TVD; formation dip had increased to 90.4 degrees. </p>

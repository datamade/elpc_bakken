Then the bit re-entered the target window at 14,202’ MD 11,14351’ TVD showing an overall dip of 90.8 degrees. Next while coming up in the target window the top of the clean was encountered at 14,440’ MD / 11,134.1’ TVD. Next entering the clean zone from 14,622’MD, 11,134.58’ TVD to 14,884’ MD, 11,135.41’ TVD had shown a light rollover to 89.9 degrees. The decision was made to trip out ofthe hole for the BHA at 14,909' MD on March 15, 2015 at 11:15 pm CDT. Reached bottom and began drilling ahead on March 16th, 2015 around 2:10 PM., CDT. A max trip gas of 4933 units was seen. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">From 15,000' MD to 17,000 MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.45 min/ft. The Target window was changed to 13’ feet below the Three Forks top to 24’ feet below the Three Forks top, after a discussion with the company geologist. The background gases averaged 329 units with a max of 869 units. Then the bit continued to drill ahead while the clean zone was seen from 15,399’ MD / 11,133.26’ TVD to 15,549’ MD / 11,133.64’ TVD, showing an overall dip of 90.2 degrees. <br/>From 17,000' MD to 19,000’ MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.50 min/ft. The background gases averaged 307 units with a max of 1279 units. The wellbore continued to drill ahead in the target window. The wellbore encountered the clean zone from 17,431’ MD, 11128.76’ TVD to 17,573’ MD, 11128.36’ TVD gave an overall estimated 90.15 degree dip. The wellbore entered the clean gamma zone at 18,769’ MD 11,122.87’ TVD showing an estimated 90.26 degree dip. The plan going forward was to push up to encounter the top of the clean again due to an expected dip increase <br/>From 19,000’ MD to 20,925’ MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.57 min/ft. The background gases averaged 339 units with a max of 1481 units. The top of the clean zone was re-entered at 19,143’ MD, 11,118.91’ TVD. These points had shown that the dip has increased to around 90.6 degrees. The wellbore entered the clean zone again from 19,293’ MD, 11,117.67’ TVD until 19,539’ MD, 11,113.69’ TVD. These gamma points had sown a dip increase to 90.9 degrees. The formation was projected out at a 90.7 degrees until 20,000 MD then projected out at 90.4 degrees. The wellbore continued to <br/>drill ahead just above the clean zone in the upper part of the target window until TD was reached. The TD of the well was reached at 20,925' MD around 2:35 PM. CDT, on March 19, 2015. <br/>Conclusion <br/>Overall the well had poor to fair gas and oil shows. In the Three Forks formation the average ROP was around 0.51 min/ft. Lateral #1 ﬁnished with 89.36% of the wellbore being in the Three Forks target. The wellbore was estimated to be around 10.64% being in the Internal 1 below the Three Forks target window. We are very excited to see the results once the well is put into production. <br/>Joseph Magnan Wellsite Geologist </p>

The Mission Canyon was picked from rate of penetration, gamma, and sample changes. The formation consisted of Limestone: Brown, light brown, cream, tan, dark brown, blocky, packstone, carbonaceous, ﬁrm to brittle, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, faint thin streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.80 min/ﬁ and the background gases averaged 64 units </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Lodgepole was observed next. The Lodgepole was picked based on sample, and rate of penetration changes. The samples consisted of Limestone: Gray—brown, light gray, gray, light brown, tan, ﬁrm to brittle, packstone, slightly carbonaceous, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming weak cloudy cut. The kick—off point was reached at 10,670' MD on March 10, 2015, around 5:15 PM, CDT. Reached bottom and began drilling ahead on March 11, 2015 around 9:50 AM CDT. The rate of penetration averaged 0.96 min/ﬂ. and background gas averaged around 47 units. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 11,130'MD 1 1,04 7' TVD -8, 739'SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was next being observed. The Upper Bakken Shale was picked based on gamma and samples. The samples changed to Shale: Black, dark brown, blocky, ﬁssile, gritty to smooth, abundantly carbonaceous, argillaceous, ﬁrm to hard, brittle, no porosity, traces of limestone, even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence, instant thick milky yellow cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.50 min/ﬂ and background gas was around 699 units, with a max of 956 units. </p>

The average rate of penetration was 0.78 min/ﬁ and background gas averaged 317 units with a max of 524 units. <br/>Lower Bakken Shale 11,262 ' MD 11,11 0' TVD -8, 802 ' SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale was next being observed, The Upper Bakken Shale was picked based on gamma and samples. The samples changed to Shale: Black, dark to very dark gray brown, blocky, ﬁssile, gritty, earthy, carbonaceous, argillaceous, ﬁrm to hard, no porosity, even faint yellow green ﬂuorescence, slow thin streaming into thick <br/>yellowish milky cut.

Field gas is gathered and transported through the system to Hiland Partners’ Watford City Plant (Sec. 6—151N~102W) for processing. The system has interconnections to allow offloading excess gas volumes to Hess’ Tioga plant (Sec. 26-157N-95W) and to OneOK’s Stateline plant (Sec. 21-155N-103W). <br/>See attached plats. <br/>Gathering Segment Name: WC-Epping — Lakeside Gathering System <br/>3a. 3b. 3c. 3d. 3e. <br/>Maximum Current Capacity of Gathering Segment: 55 000 MCFD <br/>Current Throughput of Gathering Segment: 33 000 MCFD <br/>Anticipated Capacity ofGathering Segment At IP Date: 60 500 MCFD <br/>Anticipated Throughput ofGathering Segment At IP Date: 57,000 MCFD (including these Wells) Issues or Expansion Plans: Hiland plans to install additional compression and line loops prior to <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>initial production from these wells. <br/>Flowback Strategy <br/>4a. 4b. <br/>First production is expected 2/18/15, Gas sales connection is expected by 2/3/15 Anticipated oil and gas rates: P 1566 BO PD, 2637 MCFD </p>

Statewide percentage of gas flared: 11.31% (5/2014) 5b. Fieldwide percentage of gas flared: Brooklyn, 2.4% (15/2014) <br/>Alternatives to Flaring <br/>6a. Purchaser capacity is expected to be sufficient for the volumes produced from these wells. In the event that electric power is required on-site, a natural gas powered generator will be evaluated. installation of a liquid stripping plant to be utilized in the event of upset conditions would not be economic. Such an installation will be re-evaluated as additional wells are completed and if conditions change. <br/>6b. A natural gas powered generator could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 45-60 MCFD. A liquid stripping plant could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 40%. On lease gas use by Heater/Treaters will consume approximately 23 MCFD </p>

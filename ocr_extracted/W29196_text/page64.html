The Mildred 6-19H1 is a horizontal well targeting the Three Forks Porosity crossing Sections 19 and 18. The Mildred 6-l9H1 well was spud on March 06‘“, 2015 and drilling was completed on March 19m, 2015. Lateral #1 was drilled to a TD of 20,925’ MD. The surface location was set at 455' FSL & 890' FEL, with lateral #1 ending coordinates of 228.7 ’ FNL & 1,517 .75' FEL of Section 18 and 9,875.50' N—S & -627.76' E-W from the surface location. Joseph Magnan and Scott Kerr of Neset Consulting Service, provided mudlogging and geological services beginning on March 09, 2015 in the vertical hole at 9,400’ MD in the Top Charles formation through TD at 20,925’ MD in the Three Forks formation. Geospect Gas Detection Services were utilized throughout the vertical, curve, and horizontal part of the well. Thirty and One Hundred foot lagged samples were caught, washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Sample quality was poor to good during the well. Oil shows were poor to fair while in zone. <br/>Top Charles <br/>Mud logging services began at 9,400’ MD in the Top Charles Formation on March 09, 2015 around 7:35 PM, CDT. The Top Charles samples consisted of Anhydrite: White, off—white, blocky, soﬁ, poor intergranular porosity, trace dolomite light gray, gray, brown, blocky, soft to ﬁrm, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, poor to moderate induration, slightly calcareous, scattered white mineral ﬂuorescence, no cut. Then the samples changed to various thicknesses of Dolomite: Light gray, gray, blocky, soﬁ to ﬁrm, argillaceous, microcrystalline, poor to moderate induration, trace Anhydrite: White, off-white, blocky, soﬁ, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow and scattered white mineral ﬂuorescence, no cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.54 min/ﬂ and the background gasses averaged 35 units. </p>

The Base of the Last Salt samples consisted of Dolomite: Light gray, gray, blocky, soft to ﬁrm, cryptocrystalline, slightly argillaceous, poor induration, interbedded limestone, Anhydrite: 40%white, off-white, blocky, soﬁ, poor intercrystalline porosity, even yellow ﬂuorescence, faint streaming weak cloudy cut. Then the samples changed to Limestone: Brown, light brown, tan, blocky, packstone, carbonaceous, ﬁrm, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered yellow/green ﬂuorescence, faint streaming cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.53 min/ﬂ and the background gas averaged 51 units </p>

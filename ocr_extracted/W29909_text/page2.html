The wellbore continued to drill in the lower target zone until 11,500’ measured depth. Between 10,503’ to 11,500’ samples were generally described as sandstone: tan, brown, translucent, cream tan, ﬁne, subrounded, well sorted, poorly cemented, dolomitic cement; 40% shale, blue green, pyritic, ﬁssile; rare pyrite; fair porosity; scattered green ﬂuorescence, cloudy milky green fair streaming cut. Drilling rates ranged from 0.20 to 3.7 7 minutes per foot and averaged 0.31 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 118 to 1656 units and averaged 629 units. Gamma ranged from 44 to 95 API and ranged from 69 API. <br/>At 11,500’ measured depth, the wellbore went out of the base of the target. The wellbore dropped in true vertical depth and brieﬂy encountered the Aquitard at 12,015’. Gamma spiked to 154 API. Sliding succeeded in bringing the wellbore higher in true vertical depth. The wellbore encountered the base of the target zone at 12,180’. The wellbore continued to drill in the lower part of the target zone. At 12,393’ measured depth, the wellbore deﬂected off the set line and the hot gamma was seen. Between 12,180’ to 12,393’ the samples were generally described as sandstone: translucent, cream gray, off white, very ﬁne, subrounded to subangular, moderately sorted, moderately cemented, dolomitic cement; 25% siltstone, light gray, platy, laminated; 15% shale, light blue green, light gray, pyritic, ﬁssile; 1% pyrite; poor porosity; scattered dull green ﬂuorescence, cloudy green cut. It is notable that we did not see any orange shale/siltstone in this interval. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.23 to 1.87 minutes per foot and averaged 0.39 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 146 to 881 units and averaged 652 units. Gamma ranged from 44 to 112 API and averaged 66 API. <br/>The wellbore continued to drill in the lower part of the target zone until 13,279’ measured depth. Here the hot gamma was encountered and the wellbore crossed the set line. This contact point was used to estimate the dip to be 90 degrees. At 13,306’ measured depth the wellbore went out the top of the target zone. Sliding succeed in bring the wellbore down in true vertical depth and entered the top of the target zone at 13,600’ measured depth. The wellbore continued to drill in the top 2’ of the target zone until 14,300’. The interval of 13,600’ to 14,300’ the samples were generally described as sandstone: light tan, off white, cream tan, rare pyrite, very ﬁne, subrounded, moderately sorted, moderately cemented, dolomitic cement; 15% shale, light blue green; 10% siltstone, light gray, laminated in part; good porosity; scattered brown oil staining, scattered dull yellow ﬂuorescence, milky green cut. Gamma ranged from 58 to 120 API <br/>and averaged 92 API. Total gas averaged 654 units. Drilling rates ranged from 0.20 to 3.67 minutes per foot. <br/>At 14,300’ measured depth the clean gamma was encountered. This contact point was used to estimate the dip to be 8966 degrees. The wellbore continued to drill in the clean gamma until 15,257’. Here the hot gamma was encountered at the set line. Between 14,300’ and 15,257’ drilling rates ranged from 0.27 to 2.5 minutes per foot and averaged </p>

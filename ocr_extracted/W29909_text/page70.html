Bergstrom 31-13TFH, and G. Bergstrom 4113TFH. The Kaldahl 44-12TFH is a horizontal well with the two mile lateral across sections 12 and 1, targeting the Three Forks. Bottom hole location is in the NENE of Section 1 T156N R97W. The Kaldahl 44-12TFH was spudded November 19, 2014 at 1:30 am and reached a total measured depth of 21,05 1 ’ on December 30, 2014 at 5 am. Wellsite geological services provided by Jessica Stark, Matthew McHugh, and Jennifer Meidinger of Neset Consulting Service began at 7,150’. A Total Gas Detection system was utilized for gas analysis. Samples were caught every thirty feet throughout the vertical and curve and every ﬁfty feet throughout the lateral, as well as intermediate samples when necessary. One set of samples was washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 7,150’ — 9,680’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 7,150’ measured depth in the lower Amsden at 3: 10 am on December 18th, 2014. The lower Amsden consisted of cream red anhydrite with light red brown siltstone. <br/>Tyler 7,1 70’ MD 7,163 ’ TVD -4, 928’ SS <br/>The top of the Tyler marker was picked using gamma. The Tyler came in 1’ high to the prognosis. The ﬁrst sample in the Tyler was a light red anhydrite with trace amounts of red siltstone. As drilling continued the samples transitioned to a brick red ﬁssile shale. Overall the Tyler had poor porosity and little oil shows. Total gas ranged from 112 to 185 units and averaged 125 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.30 to 5.13 minutes per foot and averaged 0.79 minutes per foot. <br/>Kibbey Lime 7, 714’ MD 7, 706’ TVD -5,4 71 ’ SS The Kibbey Lime was picked at a drop in gamma and the sample change from an <br/>orange red siltstone to a cream gray limestone. The Kibbey came in 2’ high to the prognosis. </p>

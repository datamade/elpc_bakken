The top of the upper Bakken Shale was picked at a sharp increase in rate of penetration and change in sample from limestone to shale. Gamma also spiked, reaching as high as 606 API. Background gas ranged from 365 to 702 units, averaging 597 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 1.07 to 2.83 minutes per foot, averaging 1.40 minutes per foot. The upper Bakken was described as black carbonaceous shale with no visible porosity and a bright fast streaming cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,113’MD 10,062’ TVD -7,827’ SS <br/>The top of the Middle Bakken was picked at a decrease in rate of penetration and gamma. The ﬁrst sample caught in the Middle Bakken was described as light gray dolomite with good to fair porosity. Samples transitioned to a gray sandstone with poor porosity and a cloudy green fair streaming cut. Rate of penetration in the Middle Bakken ranged from 1.23 to 4.77 minutes per foot, averaging 2.56 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 241 to 702 units, averaging 408 units. Gamma ranged from 56 to 270 API, averaging 86 API. Did not see the clean gamma bench which is between 30 to 40 API. <br/>Lower Bakken 10,216’MD 10,113’ TVD -7,878’SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The top of the Lower Bakken Shale was picked at an increase in rate of penetration and gamma. Sample changed from sandstone to black shale. Gamma peaked at 793 API and averaged 611 API. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.97 to 3.77 minutes per foot and averaged 1.57 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 342 to 746 units and averaged 613 units. <br/>Three Forks 10,286’ MD 10,140’ TVD -7,905’ SS <br/>The top of the Three Forks was picked at a decrease in rate of penetration and gamma, as well as a change in sample from black shale to gray tan sandstone. Rate of penetration in the Three Forks while drilling the curve ranged from 1.03 to 5.47 minutes per foot and averaged 3.41 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 314 to 601 units and averaged 413 units. Gamma ranged from 40 to 144 API and averaged 68 API. Initially samples were gray tan sandstone with overall poor porosity. Samples had a good yellow green streaming cut. Samples quickly transitioned to a light gray sandstone with 10% light blue green shale and fair to poor porosity. Intermediate casing point was reached at 10,503’ measured depth on December 22, 2014 at 7:30 am. Projection to bit put the wellbore at the target TVD of 10,150’ TVD at 90.74 degrees. </p>

ROP in the Mission Canyon ranged from 0.10 to 0.90 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas measurements ranging from 27 to 240 units. Samples generally consisted of limestone, which were medium to light and dark gray, medium to light and dark brown, packstone to wackestone, moderately argillaceous, moderately carbonaceous, moderately well indurated, fair intergranular porosity, light to dark green and dark gray ﬂuorescence, with slow to fast streaming cuts. </p>

ROP in the Lodgepole ranged from 0.10 to 3.00 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, with gas measurements ranging from 27 to 1,692 units. Samples generally consisted of limestone which were medium to dark and light gray, brown to light brown in part, argillaceous, wackestone, silty, slightly carbonaceous, moderately well indurated, fair to good intergranular porosity, light green to dark green/gray ﬂuorescence, with moderately fast streaming cuts. <br/>Curve Section 8,810’ — 9,639’ MD <br/>The curve section of Parshall 93—2827H began 273’ MD into the Lodgepole formation at a KOP of 8,81 0’ MD. Directional tools were picked up on October 7, 2014, and the curve was started at 3:30 PM CDT on October 7, 2014. Drilling rates in the curve ranged from 0.10 to 3.00 minutes per foot while sliding and rotating, and gas measurements ranged from 39 to 1,778 units. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the curve to correlate Parshall 93—2827H with Parshall 92-28H. </p>

ROP in the U88 ranged from 0.20 to 2.30 minutes per foot while sliding and rotating, with gas measurements ranging from 459 to 1,778 units. Here shale samples were generally dull black to very dark gray and very dark brown, blocky, ﬁssile, carbonaceous, spotted dark yellow to dark green to black ﬂuorescence, with instant to <br/>fast blooming milky cuts. </p>

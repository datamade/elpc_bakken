    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">EOG Resources Parshall 93-2827H is a horizontal well located in NW/NW Section 28 T152N R90W in Mountrail County, North Dakota, and was drilled by H&P 316, with surface and Kelly bushing elevations of 1,929’ and 1,953’ respectively. The three phases of Parshall 93-2827H were vertical, curve, and horizontal sections, with the horizontal section targeting the Middle Bakken formation. Parshall 93-2827H had a spud date of October 5, 2014, with geological logging and gas detection services beginning at 7,280’ MD in the Kibbey formation. Lagged thirty foot samples (with occasional lagged ten foot samples to determine formation tops in all sections) were collected in the vertical and curve sections, and lagged one hundred foot samples were collected in the horizontal section. All samples were washed, dried, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core and Sample Library, located on the campus of the University of North Dakota in the city of Grand Forks. Parshall 93-2827H reached TD of 16,415’ MD at 6:35 PM CDT on October 13, 2014 in SW/SW Section 27 T152N R90W. <br/>Vertical Section 7,280 ’ — 8,810’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 7,280’ MD in the bottom of the Kibbey formation on October 6, 2014. The gas detection system was tested before reaching logging depth to ensure that the system was functioning correctly. The logged vertical section was drilled through the Charles and Mission Canyon formations, and into the Lodgepole formation, where rate of penetration (ROP) ranged from 0.10 to 2.70 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas measurements ranged from 17 to 436 units. Kick off point (KOP) was reached within the Lodgepole formation at 5:30 AM CDT on October 7, 2014 at <br/>8,810’ MD. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Charles formation top was picked at 7,357’ MD/-5,402’ SS. ROP in the Charles formation ranged from 0.10 to 2.00 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas measurements ranged from 17 to 269 units. Samples generally consisted of limestone, which were light gray to light brown, slight reddish brown, cream tan gray, dark gray in part, carbonaceous to argillaceous, wackestone to packstone, with moderately poor induration, fair to good intergranular porosity, yellow green to dark gray ﬂuorescence, and a slow streaming cut. <br/>Base 0fthe Last Salt 7, 769’ MB 7, 767’ TVD -5,814’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered within the Charles formation at 7,769’ MD/—5,814’ SS. This was picked by the last sample collected in the Charles formation with a majority of salt present with minor limestone and anhydrite, and by a decrease in ROP during transition from the last salt bed into beds of limestone with minor anhydrite and calcite, which were observed in samples collected until the Mission Canyon formation was encountered. </p>

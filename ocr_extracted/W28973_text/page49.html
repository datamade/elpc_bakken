Thorson 159-94-7A-17-2HS was drilled as a single leg horizontal well targeting the Middle Bakken. The well is located in Section 7 T159N R94W in Burke County, North Dakota, USA. The K. Thorson 159-94-7A—17-2HS was spud September 20, 2014. A total measured depth of 19,027 feet was reached on October 22, 2014 at 11:30 am central stande time; 19 days from spud. A 12.25 inch wellbore was drilled from surface to a measured depth of 1,988 feet. At that time 9.625 inch casing was set. Geological services began at 7,400 feet within the Charles Formation, with 24 hour supervision through the vertical hole, curve and lateral. Thirty and ﬁﬁy foot samples were caught and saved to be archived with the ND Core and Sample Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. All ﬁles were submitted per NDIC requirements. A Neset total gas detector was utilized for monitoring total gas to the total depth of the well. <br/>Vertical Hole 8,400’ MD — 8, 639’ MD <br/>Logging began within the Mission canyon at a measured depth of 8,400 feet on October 9, 2014 at approximately 7:00 am central standard time. <br/>Lodgepole 8,518’ MD 8,515. 93’ T VD -6,1 70. 93’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 8,5 18 feet, a true vertical depth of 8,515.93 feet and sub-sea of -6, 170.93 feet, 4.1 feet high to prognosis. Samples at that time were described as a gray tan to gray, hard, microcrystalline, limestone. <br/>Kick off point was reached at a measured depth of 8,639 feet at 2:30 pm central standard time on October 9, 2014. At that time the pipe was tripped out of the hole to pick up the bottom hole assembly for the curve. <br/>Curve 8,639’ 1WD —- 9,525’ MD <br/>Drilling resumed at 2:30 pm central standard time October 10, 2014. The target true vertical depth was 9,162 feet. Gamma correlations were done with K. Thorson 159— 94-7A-17-1HS offset log. Initial gamma correlations indicated the target line was coming in 3 feet high to right on target. At the False Bakken the gamma correlation indicated the target was at a true vertical depth of 9,165 feet. It was unclear if the target would continue dropping due to apparent thickening through the remainder of the curve. Because of this it was decided to drop the target true vertical depth to 9,165 feet. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 9,290’MD 9,120’ TVD -6,775’SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was encountered at a measured depth of 9,290 feet, a true vertical depth of 9, 120 feet and sub-sea of -6,7 75 feet, 5 feet low to prognosis. Samples at that time were described as a black, hard, blocky, extremely carbonaceous, </p>

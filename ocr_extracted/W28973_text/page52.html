A maximum background gas reading of 797 units was recorded while drilling within the shale. <br/>The gamma correlation done at the top of the Upper Bakken Shale indicated the target zone was coming in right on to the target true vertical depth of9, 165 feet. <br/>Middle Bakken 9,329’ MD 9,134” T VD -6, 789’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 9,329 feet, a true vertical depth of 9,134 feet and sub-sea of -6,789 feet, 5 feet low to prognosis. Samples at that time were described as a gray to light gray, ﬁrm to soﬁ, calcareous, argillaceous, siltstone. This rock exhibited poor intergranular porosity, and instant broad streaming, instant fair cloudy cuts. While drilling within the Middle Bakken background gas ranged between 175 to 400 units, with a max connection gas of 786 units. <br/>The gamma correlation done at the top of the Middle Bakken indicated the target zone was coming in 1 foot high at a true vertical depth of 9,164 feet. No target changes were made at that time. <br/>The curve was completed at a measured depth of 9,525 feet on October 11, 2014 at 10:30 pm central stande time. Directional projected a true vertical depth of9, 160.6 feet at the bit. Based on this projection it was estimated the bit landed approximately 27 feet into the Middle Bakken. <br/>Lateral No.1 9,525 ’ MD — 19,027 ’ MD <br/>Drilling resumed on October 16, 2014 at approximately 10:30 am central stande time. Targets were set at a target true vertical depth of 9, 165 feet at a measured depth of 9,500 feet projected out at the estimated dip of 89.3 degrees. <br/>Samples while drilling ahead within the target window were described as a light gray to gray, soft to ﬁrm, calcareous, platy limestone. This rock exhibited poor intergranular porosity and faint pinpoint streaming, weak cloudy cuts. Only trace amounts of dolomite was noted. Background gas ranged between 100 to 600 units. <br/>Gamma correlations indicated dips ranging between 89.2 degrees to 89.3 degrees. Because of this targets were held at 89.3 degrees. As drilling continued dip calculations began to shallow. At a measured depth of 12,900 feet and true vertical depth of 9,205 feet it was decided to adjust the target inclination to 89.4 degrees. Samples at that time were described as a gray to light gray, soil to ﬁrm, calcareous, platy limestone. This rock exhibited poor intergranular porosity. Background gas ranged between 100 to 250 units, with connection gasses peaking around 300 units. <br/>Gamma correlations while drilling within the rattier gamma zones were difficult. In order to avoid moving too deep in section it was decided to shallow the target inclination at a measured depth of 14,500 feet and true vertical depth of 9,221 feet to an inclination of 89.7 degrees. </p>

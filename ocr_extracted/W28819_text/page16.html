Lateral stimulation will consist of multiple frac stages, consisting of a slick water or hybrid system with proppant. All frac stages will be pumped down a “tie-back” string of 4-1/2” casing of similar or stronger weight and grade to that of the liner. The tie back string will be run from surface to the top of the production liner and will provide pressure isolation during fracture stimulation. <br/>Abnormal Pressures and H28 Gas No abnormal pressures or temperatures or other hazards are anticipated. HZS gas is not expected <br/>to be encountered in this wellbore, but precautions will be taken to monitor for the presence of H28 while drilling. </p>

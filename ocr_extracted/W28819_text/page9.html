Measured daily pad sales volume will be the total gas volume from all wells that is sold into the sales pipeline, as measured by a sales meter. <br/>5. Monthly pad sales volume will be the summation of the previous months measured daily pad sales volumes. <br/>6. The measured monthly well sales volume will be the measured monthly well produced volume divided by the measured monthly pad produced volume times the monthly pad sales volume. 7. Well revenue will be calculated based on the monthly well sales volume. <br/>Meter Descriptions <br/>Oil Oil will be measured through tank gauges and run tickets and corioilis meters. The coriolis meter will be a FMC Coriolis Promass 83F meter, MicroMotion F-Series, or a Micro-Motion CMF 200. <br/>Water Water will be measured through tank gauges and run tickets and corioilis meters. The water meter will <br/>be a FMC Coriolis Promass 83F meter, MicroMotion F—Series, Micro-Motion CMF 200, NuFlo MC-ll+ turbine meter, or NuFlow MC-lll turbine meter. <br/>Gas Gas will be measured via v-cone or oriﬁce plate meter. <br/>Proving Proving will be done by measuring produced well liquid volumes (1) in series through the well meter and a master meter or (2) comparing metered volumes with dedicated tank gauges. </p>

The Base of Last Salt was picked off of correlating drill rates to that of an off-set log, changes in gamma, and a change in lithology from salt to a light to medium tan, gray brown, limestone. The lithology through this formation consisted of a light to medium tan, gray brown limestone. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,321 ’ MD 9,319’ TVD -6,675’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,321 feet, 25 feet high to the prognosis. The top was picked primarily off of correlating drill breaks with those of the off-set wells and conﬁrmed by gamma. Samples in the upper portion of the Mission Canyon exhibited a light to medium tan, light gray, ﬁnely crystalline limestone with occasional interbedded anhydrite present. <br/>Lodgepole 9,806 ’ MD 9,804 ’ TVD -7,160’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,806 feet. The top of the Lodgepole was initially evaluated using a correlation between gamma ray in this well and the Talkington #21-20'1‘FH. There was also a change in samples from a pale to light tan limestone at the base of the Mission Canyon formation, to a light to medium gray limestone in the top of the Lodgepole formation. <br/>A KOP of 10,043’ MD was reached at 3:30 PM MDT on August 17th, 2014. Using the Lodgepole top, and several gamma markers before KOP as a reference, the landing target for the curve was set at 10,565’ TVD, roughly 10 feet into the Pronghorn formation. <br/>After tripping out of the hole, picking up the curve assembly, and tripping back to bottom, they started building the curve at 1:30 AM MDT on August 18“, 2014. <br/>False Bakken 10, 652’ MD 10,513 ’ TVD -7,869 ’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 10,652 feet and a true vertical depth of 10,513 feet, which was 13 feet high to the prognosis. The lithology within the False Bakken consisted of dark to medium gray, ﬁnely crystalline, argillaceous, limestone. The top of the False Bakken formation suggested the landing target be lowered to 10,575’ TVD. <br/>Scallion 1 0, 738 ’ MD 1 0,544 ’ TVD - 7, 900’ SS The Scallion formation was next encountered at a TVD of 10,585 feet, which was <br/>14 feet high to the prognosis. This formation consisted of gray to medium gray, gray brown, gray cream, ﬁnely crystalline, argillaceous limestone, with trace amounts of a </p>

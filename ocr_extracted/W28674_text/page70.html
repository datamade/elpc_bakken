    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">wellbore encountered the LBS remnant. The directional driller was able to turn inclinations back down and steer the wellbore into the target window. Using the entry and exit points of the LBS remnant, formation clip was caICulated at 89.3 degrees. The wellbore tracked along the top of the target window out to 12,500’ MD. At this point it dropped down into the middle of the target window. <br/>Drilling continued in the middle of the target window out to 14,700’ MD. At this point it once again encountered the warm gamma streak along the top of the target window. Using this point as a reference formation dip was calculated at 89.7 degrees. At 15,912’ MD the decision was made to trip to surface to change out the BHA due to slow penetration rates. The rig crew started tripping out of the hole at 12:00 AM MDT on August 22"”, 2014. After changing out the BHA and tripping back to bottom they resumed drilling the lateral at 11:45 PM MDT that morning. <br/>As they drilled ahead the wellbore tracked along in the middle of the target window with formation dip running at 89.7 degrees. At 17,300’ MD the BHA encountered a warm gamma streak at the base of the target window. The directional driller put in a slide to steer the BHA back up in zone. At this point inclinations started to drop once and the warm gamma streak along the base of the target window was once again encountered. Aﬁer putting in a slide to steer the BHA back up in inclination they were unable to drill. As a result, they tripped out of the hole at 18,415’ MD to replace the BHA. The rig crew started tripping out of the hole at 8:30 AM MDT on August 23rd, <br/>2014. Alter picking up a new BHA and tripping back to bottom they resumed drilling the lateral at 10:30 PM MDT that evening. <br/>As drilling resumed the directional driller steered the wellbore back up into the middle of the target window. As the wellbore entered into the target window formation dip was calculated at 89.9 degrees. Once the wellbore reached the middle of the target window the directional driller put in a slide to level off inclinations and run with dip. At this point the assembly was allowed to rotate out to a Total Depth of 20,320’ MD. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation Koch #34—19PH reached a total depth of 20,320’ MD at 11:45 AM MDT on August 24‘“, 2014. This well is currently awaiting completion. </p>

The TIH began until tagging cement where the cement, Float & Shoe and ten feet of new formation were drilled to perform the FIT test. After ﬁnishing with the FIT test drilling resumed with the North West lateral with casing exited at a MD of 10,280’ at 2:45 am. CST on January 22, 2015. Drilling continued with the wellbore exiting casing at 89 degrees dropping in TVD into the lower half of the Middle Bakken target window seeing the warm gamma from the A faces. Slides were done to begin working on the planned directional turn as well as to work on keeping the wellbore at or slightly below dip to work on dropping the wellbore slowly in TVD to see the A to C faces transition in gamma. Penetration rates averaged around 250 — 280 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 100 — 150 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 200 — 300 units with connection gases reaching as high as 365 units. The samples seen in the upper portion of the target window exhibited a cream/cream gray sandstone with traces of siltstone and limestone present and an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>DayZ 10,600’—13,700’MD <br/>Drilling continued with slides done throughout the day ﬁnishing the planned directional turn aﬁer reaching 284 degrees as well as to continue to work on keeping the wellbore at or slightly below dip to work on dropping the wellbore a few feet in TVD to see the clean—up in gamma from the A to C faces transition. As the wellbore would drop in TVD and the gamma would begin to clean up the wellbore appeared to keep deﬂecting and would continue to track the A to C faces contact. Slides were done throughout the day to continue to work on breaking through the hard streak and appeared to break through at a MD of 12,050’ and continued to drop in TVD through the lower portion of the target window seeing the clean gamma from the A to C faces transition giving the formation a calculated dip rate of 89.42 degrees. The wellbore throughout the day continued to drop in TVD at around 885 degrees reaching about 15’ below the Middle Bakken target window before being leveled out and heading back up section at around 91 degrees. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 250 — 300 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 50 — 100 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 800 — 1,000 units with connection gases reaching as high as 1,785 units. The samples seen throughout the lower portion of the Middle Bakken exhibited a cream tan/cream gray tan sandstone with traces of siltstone, limestone and pyrite present with an even to spotty yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Day 3 13, 700’ — 17,650’MD <br/>Drilling continued with slides done to work on bringing the wellbore up in TVD back into the Middle Bakken target window. Aﬁer seeing the slides the wellbore built through the formation at around 91 to 91.5 degrees reaching the lower portion of the </p>

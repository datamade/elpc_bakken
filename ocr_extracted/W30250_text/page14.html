The top of the Mission Canyon was picked off an increase in penetration rates as well as comparisons to the offsetting Jones #11-8-2XH porosity benches throughout the Mission Canyon. Penetration rates throughout the majority of the Mission Canyon averaged around 100 — 110 ﬁ/hr with increases up to 150 ﬁ/hr seen throughout the porosity benches. The samples throughout the upper 100' of the formation exhibited primarily a gray tan/cream gray tan limestone with trace to moderate anhydrite present and occasional dolomite mixed in. The remainder of the formation exhibited primarily limestone with trace amounts of cream to off—white anhydrite present. Background gases throughout the Mission Canyon averaged around 39 - 79 units with increases up to 101 units through the porosity benches. <br/>Lodgepole 9,184’ MD 9,181 ’ TVD -6, 83 0 ’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9, 1 84’, true vertical depth of 9,181 ’. The Lodgepole formation was picked at the base of the lower Mission Canyon porosity as well as a sample change from a cream gray tan limestone to a cream gray/light to medium gray limestone. Gamma was logged across the top of the Lodgepole down to KOP. Gamma correlations up to this point continued to come in consistent with the Jones #1 1-8-2XH and the Jones #11—8H wells. Penetration rates throughout the formation down to KOP averaged around 80 - 120 ﬁ/hr with background gases averaging around 67 - 84 units with connection gases reaching as high as 112 units. KOP was reached at 11:15 pm. CST on January 18, 2015 at a measured depth of 9,446'. <br/>Curve 9,446 ' — 10,290’ MD </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The curve for the North West lateral was started in the Lodgepole formation at a measured depth of 9,446' at 2:30 pm. CST on January 19, 2015. An 8 3/4” Security bit and 2.38 degree ﬁxed mud motor were used to build the curve. The landing target for the Jones #11-8XH at the beginning of the curve was set at 9,968’ @ 89 deg based off the Lodgepole top and the ﬁrst LP marker. The Jones #11—8—2XH and the Jones #11-8H were used for correlation purposes through the curve. Penetration rates at the beginning of the curve averaged around 100 - 130 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases through the Lodgepole formation averaged around 34 — 75 units. The lithology of the Lodgepole exhibited primarily a cream gray tan/light to medium gray limestone with occasional anhydrite and shale present. Gamma markers continued to come in consistently with the Jones #11-8—2XH and Jones #11-8H wells with the TVD landing target at this point set at 9,968’ TVD. The remainder of the Lodgepole formation was drilled out and the False Bakken was encountered. <br/>False Bakken 1 0,05 7' MD 9,91 7’ TVD — 7,566 ’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 10,057’, true vertical depth of 9,917’, six feet low to prognosis.

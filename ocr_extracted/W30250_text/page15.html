The lithology of the False Bakken exhibited a mixture of light to medium gray limestone and trace to moderate amounts of gray brown shale present.

Aﬁer seeing the Scallion top the TVD landing target remained at a true vertical depth of 9,966’ @ 89 degrees based off the isopaching from the Scallion to the Middle Bakken target area in the offset Jones wells. Penetration rates through the Scallion averaged around 90 - 100 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases in the Scallion averaged around 80 — 100 units with the samples showing a light to medium gray/cream gray tan limestone with moderate dark gray to black shale present. The Scallion was drilled through from 9,923' to 9,938’ true vertical depth. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 10,113 ’ MD 9, 938’ T VD - 7, 587’ SS <br/>The curve continued on through the remainder of the Scallion and the Upper Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 10,113’, true vertical depth of 9938’, seven feet low to prognosis. Aﬁer seeing the Upper Bakken the TVD landing target remained at 9,966’ TVD. Once the Upper Bakken was encountered penetration rates averaged around 120 — 130 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases increased to around 500 — 800 units through the Upper Bakken with the samples showing a black/gray brown black carbonaceous shale with occasional limestone present. The Upper Bakken was drilled through and the Middle Bakken was encountered next. </p>

Penetration rates decreased in the Middle Bakken from around 120 ﬁ/hr to around 80 - 100 ﬁ/hr while sliding. The samples through the upper portion of the Middle Bakken exhibited a cream gray/gray tan siltstone with trace amounts of residual black shale, limestone and sandstone present. Background gases through the Middle Bakken averaged around 350 — 500 units. Dn'lling continued on with the curve through the Middle Bakken up to a MD of 10,290'. The curve was landed around 13’ into the Middle Bakken with 88 degrees projected to the bit. <br/>The curve for the North West lateral was landed at a measured depth of 10,290’ at 4:40 am. CST on January 20, 2015 with 88 degrees projected to the bit at a true vertical depth of 9,966’. Casing for the South Lateral was set at 10,280’ MD. </p>

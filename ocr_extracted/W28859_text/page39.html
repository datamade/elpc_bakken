    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The wellbore tracked in the hot gamma at the base of the target window from 13,361’ to 13,711’. In this short interval formation dip rate calculated at 89.90 degrees. In this interval samples were generally described as sandstone, cream tan, off white, very light cream gray, cream, tan to light brown, translucent, very ﬁne, subangular to subrounded, moderately sorted, poorly cemented, slightly dolomitic cement; 20% shale, light green, very light gray, pyritic, smooth, ﬁssile; 15% siltstone, very light gray, light blue gray, gray, laminated, platy; 1% pyrite; poor to fair porosity; even dull yellow green pinpoint ﬂuorescence, fair streaming cloudy yellow cut. In this interval rate of penetration ranged from 0.20 to 1.40 minutes per foot and averaged 0.41 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 2 to 1723 units and averaged 414 units. Gamma ranged from 58 to 156 API and averaged 132 API. <br/>Sliding brought the wellbore higher, brieﬂy drilling in the clean gamma. The wellbore dropped below the target window at 14,050’, and continued drilling below the window for about 1200 feet. Drilling continued to 15,000’, at which time the survey tool failed. A new MWD tool, bit, and motor were picked up at that time. Trip gas peaked at 8,744 units. Drilling continued below the target window until 15,208’, at which point sliding brought the wellbore higher to encounter the base of the clean gamma. At this time it was determined the formation was considerably ﬂatter than expected, at 89.84 degrees. In the interval from 14,050’ to 15,208’ the rate of penetration ranged from 0.27 to 2.23 minutes per foot and averaged 0.45 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 17 to 814 units and averaged 330 units. Gamma ranged from 70 to 165 API and averaged 130 API. Samples from this interval were generally described as sandstone, off white, cream, tan, translucent, very ﬁne, subangular, moderately sorted, poorly cemented; 35% shale, very light gray, light green, pyritic, smooth, ﬁssile; 20% siltstone, very light gray, light blue gray, laminated, platy; poor porosity; scattered green pinpoint ﬂuorescence, green fair streaming cut. <br/>The last half of the wellbore drilled easier than the ﬁrst, with considerably fewer slides needed to maintain placement in zone. Gas values increased as drilling continued, reaching as high as 2256 units. Samples remained consistent to the ﬁrst half of the wellbore. The warm gamma at the top of the window and hotter gamma at the base of the window were brieﬂy encountered several times, enabling several formation dip calculations. As expected, the last 2000’ of the lateral was much steeper, at 89.19 degrees. </p>

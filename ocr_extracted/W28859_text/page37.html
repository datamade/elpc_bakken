The ﬁrst sample caught in the Middle Bakken was described as cream tan sandstone with poor to fair porosity. Samples quickly transitioned to tan to cream colored dolomite with fair porosity and a weak streaming cut. The next sample caught was majority light to medium gray sandstone with poor to fair porosity The ﬁnal sample caught before the shale was majority light to medium gray siltstone with poor porosity and a fair streaming cut. Rate of penetration in the Middle Bakken ranged ﬁ'om 0.53 to 0.97 minutes per foot, averaging 0.64 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 112 to 774 units, averaging 396 units. Gamma ranged from 35 to 102 API, averaging 79 API. The clean “B” interval was 9.5’ this in this location. As predetermined by Rich Gaber, Whiting Geologist, the ﬁnal landing target would be calculated by using the isopach from the Middle Bakken to the landing depth on the offset well, 94’. This calculated the ﬁnal landing depth to 10,225’ TVD, which was only 1’ higher than the initial target on the prognosis. <br/>Lower Bakken 10,314’MD 10,186’ TVD —7,876’SS </p>

Rate of penetration in the Three Forks while drilling the curve ranged from 0.33 to 5.93 minutes per foot and averaged 1.12 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 34 to 803 units and averaged 437 units. Gamma ranged from 47 to 130 API and averaged 80 API. Initially samples were brown and tan sandstone with overall poor porosity. Samples had a good yellow green good streaming cut. Intermediate casing point was reached at 10,533’ measured depth on August 6, 2014 at 3:30 pm. Projection to bit put the wellbore at the target TVD of 10,229’ TVD at 88.5 degrees. </p>

Trip gas peaked at 1117 units. The top of the 10’ target window is set 11’ below the base of the lower Bakken shale. The base of the window is at the base of the clean gamma, and the top of the window is about 2’ above the clean gamma. Formation dip was initially estimated to drop 70’ over the length of the lateral. The ﬁrst half of the lateral proved difﬁcult to maintain inclination to remain in the target window.

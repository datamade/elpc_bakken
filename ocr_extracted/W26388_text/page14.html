    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>Pad J is a new dual-well pad pr0posed in the SE/4 of Section 34, Tl47N—R94W. The pad <br/>includes the CCU Bison Point 44-34MBH and CCU Bison Point 44-34TFH wells scheduled for drilling in 2013. <br/>Pad K is a new dual-well pad proposed in the SW/4 of Section 20, Tl47N-R95W. The pad <br/>includes the CCU William l4-20MBH and CCU William l4-20TFl-l wells scheduled for drilling in 2013. <br/>Pad L was initially a quad-well pad located in the NE/4 of Section 29, Tl47N-R9SW. This pad was moved slightly to the southwest to minimize surface disturbance and includes additional TF wells. Pad L includes the CCU William 44-20TFH, CCU William 34-20MBH, CCU Powell 4]. 29TFH, and CCU Powell 31-29MBH wells scheduled for drilling in 2013. <br/>Pad M is a new quad~well pad located in the SW/4 of Section 21, Tl47N-R95W. The pad will include the CCU William 44-20MBH, CCU Four Aces l4-21TFH, CCU Powell 41-29MBH and the CCU Corral Creek l l-28TFH wells scheduled for drilling in 2013-2014. <br/>Pad N was initially a dual-well pad located in the NW/4 of Section 28, Tl47N-R95W. This pad has been converted to a quad-well pad to accommodate TF wells and it will include the CCU <br/>Four Aces 24-21TFH, CCU Four Aces 24-2IMBH, CCU Corral Creek ll-28MBH, and CCU Corral Creek 2 l -28TF H. <br/>Pad 0 is a new quad- well pad located in the SE/4 of Section 2], Tl47N-R95W. This pad will include CCU Four Aces 34.21TFl-l, CCU Four Aces 34-21MBH, CCU Corral Creek 31-28TFH, and CCU Con'al Creek 31-28MBH <br/>Pad P was planned and permitted before the inception of the unit as a single well pad located in SW/4 of Section 24. The location of the well will remain the same, but the well name will change from the Main Streeter l4-20H to the CCU Main Streeter 14.20TFH and is expected to be drilled in 2013. In the initial unit development plan this pad was intended to change into a tri-pad, but due to a large archeological site in this area this was not a possibility so the pad remained as a single well-pad. <br/>Pad Q was initially a single well pad located in the SW/4 of Section 36, Tl47M-R94W. This pad was converted to a dual-well pad to include one additional well. Pad Q includes the CCU Columbian l4—36TFH and the CCU Columbian 2+36TFH. <br/>Pad R was initially a single well pad in the SE/4 of Section 36, Tl47M-R94W. This pad was converted to a quad-well pad in order to accommodate two additional TF wells and a MB well that was moved from Pad Q. The wells included in this pad are the CCU Columbian 33-1MBH, CCU Columbian 33-ITFH, CCU Columbian 43-IMBH, and the CCU Columbian 43-]TFH. Due to rough topography and in order to avoid surface disturbance this pad was moved outside the unit boundary. the intermediate section will be directionally drilled, the horizontal portions of the wells will honor the unit set backs. <br/>The location of the CCU Meriwether CTB #l was initially in the SE/4 of Section 19, T147NR95W and was moved southeast to the NE/4 of Section 30, Tl47N-R95W closer to the existing <br/>lease mad in an effort to minimize surface disturbance. Construction of the CTB was completed in 2012. <br/>Page 3 of 7 Canal Creek - Bakken Unit 02-2013 </p>

Box 51810 <br/>V O O  I  Midland, Texas 79710-1810 <br/>Phone: 432-688-9043 Fax: 432-688-6084 <br/>January 21, 2013 <br/>Mr. Lynn D. Helms <br/>Director — North Dakota Industrial Commission Department of Mineral Resources <br/>600 E Boulevard Ave. Dept. 405 <br/>Bismarck, ND 58505-0840 <br/>RE: Corral Creek — Bakken Unit Quarterly Update — Q1-2013 NDIC Case Nos. 15332 and 15333 BLM NDM 101567X Dunn County, ND <br/>Dear Mr. Helms, <br/>During our conference call on January 7, 2013, Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Company LP (‘Burlington’), as operators of the Corral Creek — Bakken Unit (‘CCU’) located in T147N-R94W and Tl47N-R95W in Dunn County, ND, agreed to submit quarterly updates to the North Dakota Industrial Commission (‘NDIC’) for modiﬁcations to the supplemental ‘Exhibits 17-23’ titled, “Preliminary Lost Bridge Unit 3 Rig Development Plan” (‘Development Plan’), which were submitted to the NDIC on October 12, 2011 and made apart ofCase Nos. 15332 and 15333. <br/>Initially, the Development Plan only assumed Middle Bakken (‘MB’) drilling and provided for additional Three Forks (‘TF’) drilling based on the outcome of future studies. Additional TF wells were added to the Development Plan based on successful TF drilling and completions in and around CCU and promising initial results from Burlington’s pilot wells. Burlington plans to continue evaluating the TF formation in 2013 which may result in additional TF well locations being added to the Development Plan. The CCU drilling schedule is affected by facility constraints, minimizing rig moves, and seasonal operations in the Little Missouri State Park. Additionally, the pad and facility sites in the Development Plan were initial projections subject to change. Burlington has made every effort to accommodate landowner concerns, minimize surface disturbance, and consolidate pads where terrain and economics allow. <br/>These quarterly updates are intended to provide the NDIC with advanced notice of permit applications and modiﬁcations to the Development Plan for CCU and will not be finalized until permits are approved and well pads are built. <br/>Exhibit “A” contains a listing of wells drilled in 2012 and wells planned for 2013. Wells are grouped by well pad and include the target formation and current status of each well. The listing also includes three new well pads and the additional TF wells added to the Development Plan. <br/>Exhibit “B” illustrates the wells drilled in 2012 with blue lines, wells permitted for 2013 with green lines, wells planned but not permitted for 2013 with red lines, and existing wells drilled prior to unitization with grey lines. <br/>  <br/>   </p>

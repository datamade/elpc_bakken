The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.80* API burst rating to determine the max pressure 3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment 4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during the flow back than during the frac 5. The frac ﬂuid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates 6. Productin equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing 7. A 300# gauge will be installed on surface casing during flowback period <br/>       <br/>Water Bbls <br/>Gas MCF <br/>              <br/>  <br/>         <br/>  <br/>                              <br/>Company Telephone Number Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Company LP 281-206-5627 FOR STATE USE ONLY <br/>600 N.

It was picked by a slight up spike in gamma at 10,320 feet MD. The lithology of the Lodgepole formation was mainly limestone that was gray, tan gray, and light gray with an even green ﬂuorescence and weak cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 100 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 137 units with a max of 370 units through the Lodgepole formation. <br/>Curve 10,687’ MD — 11,3 73’ MD <br/>The curve was started at 11:35 PM CST on November 21, 2014 with an 8 3/4” Reed curve bit and a NOV 2.38 mud motor targeting the Middle Bakken formation with an initial target TVD of 11,145 feet and 10 feet into the Middle Bakken formation. The Eide 41-13—3H gamma markers were correlated to the Eide 41-13-HR and Bide 41-13-2H gamma data. Baker Hughes directional team started the curve with an average built rate of 11 degrees per 100 feet needed. While correlating gamma signatures between Eide 41—13-HR and Bide 41—13-2H, the landing target changed drastically; between 11,139 feet and 11,145 feet TVD throughout the seven Lodgepole formation markers. The remaining formation top markers of the Eide 41-13-3H were consistent with the Eide 4113-HR well, allowing the original target depth of 11,145 feet TVD to be the ideal ﬁnal target. <br/>False Bakken 11,193’ 1WD 11,108’ TVD -8,812’ SS <br/>The False Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,193 feet, 2 feet low to the prognosis. The pick of the False Bakken was primarily done off gamma correlation to the Eide 41-13I-IR curve gamma. The lithology of the False Bakken formation was tan gray to light tan gray with an even green ﬂuorescence and a fast streaming cloudy cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 33 ﬂ/hr. Gas was an average of 405 units with a maximum of 1016 units through the False Bakken formation. <br/>Upper Bakken 11,21 7’ MD 11,120’ TVD -8,825 ’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,217 feet, 3 feet low to the prognosis. The pick of the Upper Bakken was primarily done off gamma correlation to Eide 41-13-HR curve gamma. The lithology of the Upper Bakken formation was shale that was black and dark brown with a dull even green ﬂuorescence and a thick yellow cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 74 ft/hr. Gas was an average of 886 units with a maximum of 2060 units through the Upper Bakken formation. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,262’ MD 11,136 ’ T VD -8,841 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,262 feet, 4 feet low to the prognosis.

The well was drilled by Pioneer 74 ﬂex rig. The well is located in the NENE quarter of section 13 T150N RIOOW in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Eide 41-13-3H was spudded on November 9, 2014 at 2:00 PM CST. The well reached a total depth of 20,921 ’ 1W) on December 16, 2014. Geological services began at 9,3 50’ MD in the Charles formation on November 20, 2014 and continued to TD. Samples were caught by mudloggers throughout the well. All samples were washed, cataloged, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Society in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Total Gas LTD gas equipment was used to monitor gas throughout the well in correspondence with NOV <br/>RigSense EDR. </p>

Rate of penetration varied throughout the different rock types and formations but averaged 113 feet per hour throughout the vertical section. Gas averaged 119 units with a maximum reading of 342 units in the Mission Canyon formation. The Pioneer 74 ﬂex rig reached kick oﬁ‘ point at 12: 10 PM CST on November 21, 2014 at 10,687 feet. <br/>Base of Last Salt 9,585 ’ MD 9,5 76’ TVD - 7,281 ’ SS <br/>The Base of Last Salt formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,5 85 feet, 26 feet low to the prognosis. It was picked by a slight increase in drilling rate at 9,585, feet MD. Samples also changed from salt that was clear and translucent to off white anhydrite. The lithology of the Base of Last Salt formation was mainly light gray to gray limestone with an even yellow white ﬂuorescence and slow cloudy cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 115 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 97 units with a maximum of 297 units through the Base of Last Salt formation. <br/>Mission Canyon 9, 782’ MD 9, 774’ TVD - 7,4 79’ SS </p>

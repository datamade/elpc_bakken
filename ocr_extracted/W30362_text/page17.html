Additional capacity plans include the Big Gulch compressor station which is scheduled to come online mid 2016 and will add 35 MMCFD of capacity to this area.

Purchaser capacity is not expected to be sufﬁcient forthe volumes produced from these wells. In the event that electric power is required on-site, a natural gas powered generatorwill be evaluated. installation of a liquid stripping plant to be utilized in the event of upset conditions would not be economic. Such an installation will be re-evaiuated as additional wells are completed and if conditions change. <br/>6b. A natural gas powered generator could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 30-40 MCFD. A liquid stripping plant could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 40%.

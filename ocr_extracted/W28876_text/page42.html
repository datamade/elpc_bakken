A dip rate of 8976 degrees was calculated using the Aquitard encounters at 12,821 ’ and 14,821’. Sliding brought the wellbore higher in true vertical depth, and the set line was again encountered at 16,014’. A dip rate of 89.8 degrees was calculated from 14,278’ to 16,014’. Sliding brought the wellbore higher in true vertical depth. The wellbore drilled above the set line until 16,697’. A dip rate of 89.6 degrees was calculated from 16,014’ to 16,697’. While drilling above the set line most samples were sandstone: cream, light brown, translucent, off white, very ﬁne, subrounded, moderately sorted, poorly cemented, dolomitic cement; 15% shale, light green, very light gray, pyritic, ﬁssile; 15% siltstone, light gray, laminated, platy; 1% pyrite; fair porosity; trace dark brown oil staining, scattered green ﬂuorescence, green faint streaming cut. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.20 to 3.37 minutes per foot and averaged 0.47 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 51 to 797 units and averaged 410 units. Gamma ranged from 69 to 126 API and averaged 98 API. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">formation dip of 89.8 degrees was calculated from the most recent encounter with the top of the Aquitard at 15,721 ’. Sliding brought the wellbore higher, and the 4’ set line was encountered at 17,479’ measured depth. Aﬁer drilling above the set line, it was again encountered at 18,200’ and 18,580’. In the interval 17,479’ to 18,580’ a dip rate of 89.9 degrees was calculated. As drilling continued gas values improved, with the highest gas of the entire lateral recorded between 18,600’ to 19,100’. In this interval total gas ranged from 56 to 1903 units and averaged 626 units. <br/>Drilling continued until 19,855’, at which time a trip was made for a tool failure. The tool, motor, and bit were all replaced. Trip gas peaked at 6,645 units with a 10’ ﬂare. A small ﬂare was maintained while logging missed gamma. At 19,946’ a trip was made for a failed gamma tool. Trip gas peaked at 488 units with a 25’ ﬂare. The ﬂare remained over 10’ for approximately 2 hours. At 20,009’ it was determined the gamma tool had failed, and another trip was made. This time the decision was made to change the motor and tool. Trip gas was 803 units with a 10’ ﬂare. </p>

At 21,3 50’ it was determined there was no ability to slide. Aﬁer discussing the problem with Rich Gaber, the decision was made to continue to rotate ahead instead of continuing to try to slide. Drilling continued until rate of penetration and weight on bit suggested we had drilled approximately 5’ into the Bakken shale. Bottoms up was circulated out, but no notable amounts of shale were seen in sample. The bottoms up sample did contain more medium <br/>gray siltstone than previously seen. The well was called approximately 120’ short, at 21,525’. </p>

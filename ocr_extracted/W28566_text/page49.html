    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">this time the bit leveled off and appeared to lock in below the hard streak. At this point it was decided to change target and try to stay 3—4’ below the hot marker to avoid control issues due to bounces. However, a second hard streak 4-5’ below the hot marker caused the bit to take a bounce up. It was hoped that the bit would lock in and stay bouncing between the two hard streaks but the bit passed through and at 14,750’ MD passed through and above the hot marker before leveling off. As drilling continued the bit came down and rode right above the hot streak from 15,300’ — 17,500’ MD. At this point the bit bounced up and was brought down, coming into the hot marker slightly and back up, once again settling in just above the marker. Drilling continued in this spot with a few bounces seen but were easily corrected and steering was easily maintained until reaching a TD of 20,202’ MD at 7:10 am CT on 2/6/2015. The lateral showed an approximate overall drop of 36’ with a 89.750 - 89.8° overall dip. BHL of the lateral was 241.22' FSL & 1,300.65' FEL, Section 36 T150N R97W. <br/>The ﬁrst half of the lateral showed very low gas readings while drilling. Within 300’ of coming up above the hot marker and hard streak gas showed a noticeable increase. While underneath the hot marker background gas was 40-150 units with sporadic connection gases of up to 25 units over background. Aﬁer coming above the hot marker, background gases increased to ISO-1,000 units with occasional higher shows up to 1,300 units. Connection gases were seen more frequently and showed 250-1,300 units. At approximately 18,770’ MD a sudden high increase in gas was seen with readings of 800—2,950 units. Chromat gases rose accordingly with the increase with C1-C4 showing the highest gains. Propane and butane (C3, C4) both showed good increases and is typically a good indicator of the presence of oil. Gas remained at these high levels until being circulated through the gas buster at 18,875’ MI). At 19,020’ MD the gas buster was shut off and gas was showing levels from before the increase. As drilling progressed a decrease in gas was seen with reading of 100-500 units through to the end of the lateral. While there is no clear cut evidence it is appears we may have crossed through a small fractured zone or a possible structural pinch off creating a small area of trapped gas and oil that we opened up. It also appears that the hard stringer is most likely holding a thin layer of gas and oil above it creating the gas increases that were seen. There were no oil shows observed through the lateral and water weights were maintained at 9.85 to 10.05 pounds. Refer to Cross Section on page 18 to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Wiley 5-25H was drilled as a single lateral horizontal well on an eight well Eco-pad in Section 25 T150N R97W and ending in Section 36 T150N R97W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The target formation was the Middle Bakken. The surface location was set at 775’ FNL & 1,640’ FEL in Section 25 and had ending coordinates of 241.22' FSL & 1,300.65' FEL of Section 36. Drilling began on January 6, 2015 and the well was paused from January 15 to February 1, 2015 to drill other wells on the pad. Aﬁer drilling resumed a TD of 20,202’ MD was reached at 7:10 am CT on February 6, 2015. <br/>Wellsite geological services consisted of two mudloggers. A Noram gas detecting system with chromatograph was utilized. Samples were caught at 30’ intervals from 8,513’ to TD of 20,202’ MD. All samples were saved and boxed to be sent to the State of North Dakota. <br/>Charles 8,513’ MD 8,512’ TVD -6,239’ SS <br/>The Charles formation was picked off sample and drilling change. The Charles formation was salt, translucent, white, milky white, hard, brittle in part, massive, with intermittent stringers of anhydrite, white, light gray, amorphous, soﬁ. At approximately 7,523’ samples changed to limestone, light brown, tan, yellow brown, cream, crypto to microcrystalline, moderate to very calcareous, slightly argillaceous, ﬁrm to slightly soﬁ, dolomitic in part, with frequent beds of salt observed. After the Base Last at 9,152’ MD, 9,151’ TVD (-6,878’ SS) samples returned to limestone, brown, dark brown, gray brown, crypto to microcrystalline, fossiliferous at times, very to moderately calcareous, argillaceous at times, ﬁrm to slightly soﬁ, very dolomitic at times. Intervals of very poor intergranular porosity were observed and very slow streaming fluorescing cuts at times. Gas ranged ﬁom 7 to 29 units. The top of the Charles came in 2’ high to prognosis while the Base Last Salt 4’ high. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,364’ MD 9,363 ’ T VD -7, 090’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was picked off sample and drilling change and was limestone, dark brown, brown, minor light brown, microcrystalline, calcitic at times, moderately calcareous, moderately argillaceous, silty, firm to slightly hard, dolomitic at times, with intervals of poor intergranular porosity observed and very slow to fast streaming fluorescing cuts at times. Gas ranged ﬁ'om 12 to 50 units. The Mission Canyon came in 7’ low to prognosis. <br/>Lodgepole 9, 922’ MD 9,921 ’ T VD -7, 648’ SS </p>

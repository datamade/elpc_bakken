The lithology of the Lodgepole Formation was mainly limestone that was gray, tan gray, and light gray with an even green ﬂuorescence and weak cut; Rate of penetration <br/>was an average of 79 ﬁ/hr.

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The curve was started at 4:45 PM CST on January 15, 2015 with an 8 3/4 inch Reed curve bit and a NOV 2.38 degree mud motor targeting the Middle Bakken Formation with an initial target TVD of 11,233 feet and 15 feet into the Middle Bakken Formation. The Stenehjem 41-3-H gamma markers were correlated to the Stenehjem 413B and Stenehjem 41-3 -2H gamma data. Baker Hughes directional team started the curve with an average built rate of 11 degrees per 100 feet needed. While correlating gamma signatures between Stenehjem 41-3-3H and Stenehjem 41-3I—L the ideal landing target stayed consistently between 11,233 feet and 11,236 feet TVD throughout the seven Lodgepole Formation gamma markers. With the False Bakken Formation top, the ideal landing target was recommended to be 11,233 feet TVD, allowing the original target depth of 11,233 feet TVD to be the ideal ﬁnal target. <br/>False Bakken 11,353’ m 11,193’ TVD -8,816’ SS <br/>The False Bakken Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,353 feet, 3 feet high to the prognosis. The pick of the False Bakken was primarily done oﬂ' gamma correlation to the Stenehjem 41-3H curve gamma. The lithology of the False Bakken Formation was limestone that was gray to light gray with an even yellow ﬂuorescence and a streaming cloudy cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 143 ft/hr. Gas was an average of 1912 units with a maximum of 2857 units through the False Bakken Formation. </p>

The pick of the Upper Bakken was primarily done off gamma correlation to Stenehjem 41-3H curve gamma. The lithology of the Upper Bakken Formation was shale that was black and dark brown with a dull even green ﬂuorescence and a thick streaming cloudy to milky yellow cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 120 ft/hr. Gas was an average of 2070 units with a maximum of 2913 units through the Upper Bakken Formation. </p>

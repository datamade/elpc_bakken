In order to be compliant with the ND Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-21, remedial cement work is required. Continental Resources Inc. will perforate the 7" casing and cement squeeze the PERMIAN-ERODED BROOM CREEK-AMSDEN FM. - 7889', PERMIANMINNEKAHTA FM. - 7530’. CRETACEOUS-INYAN KARA FM. - 5585', CRETACEOUS-NEWCASTLE FM. - 5322' progressiver until all these intervals are isolated with cement behind the 7" as described In the attached procedure. Prior to performing the necessary squeeze work, Continental Resources Inc. requests permission to stimulate the well, clean out the wellbore, and produce the well through 2-7I8" production tubing until a pump is required to produce the well. Doing so will allow Continental Resources Inc. to complete the higher pressure phase of the completion before perforating the 7" casing and further protect the 7” casing. A 4 1I2" - 11.6# - P110 fracture string has been run from the surface to the liner top to provide additional protection of the 7" casing. This was performed in compliance with NDIC Sec 43-02-03-211 of the Administrative Code. If you are in agreement, when the well ceases to flow and a pump is required, we will perform the remedial cement work. The surface-intermediate casing annulus will be monitored with a 300 psi gauge throughout the completion operations and production of the well. Any pressure development will be reported Immediately. The 300 psi pressure gauge and valves will be visible from the ground level surface.

The average rate of penetration was 1.21 min/ﬂ and background gas averaged 247 units with a max of 2064 units. <br/>Lower Bakken Shale 11,413 ' MD 11,120' T VD -8,812'SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale Member, like the Middle Bakken Member came in below prognosis. The Upper Bakken Shale was picked 7’ below the Mildred 1-19H well, based on gamma and lithology changes. The samples changed to Shale: Black to very dark gray, blocky, ﬁssile, gritty to smooth, carbonaceous, calcareous, pyritic, ﬁrm, no porosity, bright to pale yellow to yellow green ﬂuorescence, with an instant thick to very thick milky cut. The average ROP was 0.70 min/ﬂ and background gas averaged 351 units, with a maximum of 905 units. <br/>Three Forks 11,544'MD 11,148' TVD -8,840'SS <br/>The Three Forks was the targeted formation and was encountered 9’ below prognosis depth. The Three Forks was picked based on gamma, drilling parameters and sample lithology change. The samples changed to Dolomite: Light brown, light to medium tan, tan gray, cream, cream gray, microcrystalline, moderate induration, carbonaceous, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity, with platy shale laminations, reaching concentrations of 30-40 %, light gray, light blue gray, and light green-gray, and with trace interbedded pyrite. Fluorescence shows were even to even pinpoint dull yellow to yellow green ﬂuorescence and cuts were weak and cloudy with slow streams. The average ROP was 1.13 min/ﬂ and background gas averaged 246 units, with a maximum of 625 units. </p>

The TD ofthe curve was reached at 11,758' MD and 11,157.63’ TVD on November 10, <br/>2014 at 5:10 am. CST. The intermediate casing was set at 11,738’ MD, 11,158.44’ TVD. The curve was landed about 10’ within the Three Forks. </p>

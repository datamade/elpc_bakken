    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">trying to level out the well bore and seeing a 90 degree dip based on markers seen in the clean, the bit went down into the Internal 1 at 20,793’ MD, 11,205.47’ TVD. The plan was to push back up as soon as possible back into the target window. Due to difficulties re-entering the zone due to being rolled over by the formation the well reached TD in the Internal 1 below the target window The TD of the well was reached at 21,683' MD around 1:20 AM CST on January 23, 2015. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Overall the well had poor to fair gas and oil shows. In the Three Forks formation the average ROP was around 0.54 min/ﬂ. Lateral #l ﬁnished with 62.2% of the wellbore being in the Three Forks target. The wellbore was estimated to be around 16.86% being in the out the top of the Three Forks target window. The wellbore was estimated to be around 20.94% being in the Internal 1 below the Three Forks target window. We are very excited to see the results once the well is put into production. <br/>Joseph Magnan, Scott Kerr Wellsite Geologists </p>

The Rennerfeldt 8—30H11is a horizontal well targeting the Three Forks Porosity crossing section 19, 30 and 31. The Rennerfeldt 830H1 well was spud on October3 1, 2014 and drilling was completed on January 23rd, 2015. Lateral #1 was drilled to a TD of 21,683’ MD. The surface location was set at 255' F SL & 800' FEL, with lateral #1 ending coordinates of 237.15’ FSL & 169.20' FEL of section 31 and 10,577 .05' N-S & 630.80' W-E ﬁ'om the surface location. Joseph Magnan, Scott Kerr, and Tom Purdy of Neset Consulting Service, provided mudlogging and geological services beginning on November 3, 2014 in the vertical section at 9,400’ MD in the Top Charles formation through TD at 21,683’ MD in the Three Forks formation. Geospect Gas Detection Services were utilized throughout the vertical, curve, and horizontal part of the well. Thirty and One Hundred foot lagged samples were caught, washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Sample quality was poor to good during the well. Oil shows were poor to fair while in zone. <br/>Top Charles <br/>Mud logging services began at 9,400’ MD in the Top Charles Formation on November 3rd, 2014 at 5:01 pm. CST. The Top Charles samples consisted of Anhydrite: White, off-white, blocky, soﬁ, gummy, and occasionally pasty, with poor to no intergranular porosity and Halite: massive, transparent, and frosted with no porosity. Carbonate beds intersected the Anhydrite and Halite depositions. Samples consisted of Limestone: Medium to dark gray, argillaceous, micritic, poorly indurated with no to poor porosity. Fluorescence was bright white mineral and even pale yellow; oil shows were sporadic due to the petroleum based drilling ﬂuid. The average rate of penetration was 1.02 min/ﬂ and the background gas averaged 0 units as the gas detector was under repair. <br/>Base ofthe LastSalt 9,507'MD 9,506' TVD -7,198'SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was observed next and was picked based on rate of penetration, gamma data, and the cessation of Halite presence in the lithology. The formation top was marked 21’ above the prognosis depth, which was obtained from the offset Mildred 1-19H well. The Base of the Last Salt samples consisted of Limestone: Medium to dark gray brown, medium to dark gray, tan gray, mottled, banded, packstone to wackestone, argillaceous, slightly carbonaceous, ﬁrm, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, with up to 20% Anhydrite, even to patchy dull yellow to gold ﬂuorescence and oil shows were questionable due to the petroleum based drilling ﬂuid. The average rate of penetration was 1.22 min/ﬂ and the background gas averaged 16 un1ts. </p>

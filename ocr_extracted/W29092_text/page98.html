The Upper Bakken shale was twenty one feet thick. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,964 ’ MD 1 0, 830’ T VD 8, 721 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was entered at 10,830’ TVD. The Middle Bakken in this area is about forty six feet thick and consists of a silty sandstone which is medium to dark gray, light gray, brown in part, platy, granular, ﬁrm to soft, subangular, moderately argillaceous, medium induration, limestone cementation, dolomitic, trace micrite, sucrosic on edges, samples had bright yellow ﬂuorescence, and instant milky streaming yellow cut. This was our target formation during the lateral. Gas while drilling the lateral ranged from 225 to 1300 total units while in rotation drilling. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The P Vance 154-97-14—9-21-15H reached a total measured depth of 21,869’ MD on March 27, 2015, at 10:00 AM CDT. Formation dip began downward at 89.55 to 12,500 MD. From 13,000’ MD to 14,000’ MD, the formation continued downward averaging an approximate 89.7 degree dip. From 14,500’ MD until 17,000’ MD formation came down hard ranging from 89.1 to 89.2 degrees. After 20,500’ MD formation took an unexpected up dip ranging from 90.1 to 90.23 degrees. The best porosity and oil shows came immediately above the clean gamma marker at the center of the target window. Yellow green to green brown oil was often present on the shakers while in this zone, gas was also elevated which was another way of indicating where we were in zone. We found that entering the target window from the bottom, at an angle close to the approximated formation dip would allow the bit to track formation easier. However many times the bit would glance upward through the clean marker and our bit <br/>inclination would be well above 90 degrees, causing us to slide down immediately. The P Vance 154—97-14-9-21—15H is the fourth of four wells drilled on the pad. <br/>Kevin Busch Wellsite Geologist </p>

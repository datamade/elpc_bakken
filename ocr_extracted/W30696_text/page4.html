Then every third joint to surface. <br/>Casing string(s) will be pressure tested to 0.22 psi/foot of easing string length or 1,500 psi, whichever is greater (not to exceed 70% of the internal yield strength of the casing), aﬁer cementing and prior to drilling out from under the casing shoe. <br/>The 7” intermediate casing string has been designed for service in a sour gas (H28) and salt environment. The intermediate casing has turbolizers on the bottom three (3) joints, then every other joint to 45 degrees. Centralizers will be used every other jt from 45 degrees to KOP, then every fourth joint to surface. <br/>The Liner has turbolizers on bottom (3) joints, then every other joint to TOL. B. Cementing Program: <br/>Surface Casing - Lead with approximately 500 sx Econocem W1 + 0.25 pps Poly E Flake cement mixed at 11.5 ppg (yield = 2.98 ﬁs/sx). <br/>Tail with approximately 225 sx SwiﬁCem + 0.25 pps Poly E Flake mixed at 14.2 ppg (yield = 1.49 ﬁ3/sx). <br/>Cement will be circulated back to surface with 40% excess. Top out if necessary. <br/>Intermediate Casing - Lead with approximately 750 sx EconoCem W4 + 0.2% HR-S +3025 pps Poly E Flake cement mixed at 12.7 ppg (yield 7 2.00 it /sx). <br/>Tail with approximately 550 sx HalCem W1 + 0.2% HR-S + 0.25 pps Poly E Flake + 35% SSA-1 mixed at 15.6 ppg (yield 1.56 ft /sx). <br/>Lead cement will be circulated half way into the 9 5/8” shoe, about 1200’ MD. <br/>Liner Casing - Cement with approximately 550 sx EXTENDACEM + 0.55% HR-5 + 0.5% D-AIR 5000 + 20% SSA-1 +.2% HR-25 mixed at 13.5 ppg (yield = 1.77 ft3/sx).

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">below the Lower Bakken. Gas in the upper Three Forks ranged from 150 units to 1200 units and up to 5000 total units while tripping. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The P Vance 154-97—16—9-21-16H3 reached a total measured depth of 21,812’ MD on January 1, 2015, at 3:53 AM CDT. Formation dip began downward ranging 89.8 to 89.3 degrees coming right out of the lateral casing shoe to 89.5 degrees at 14,000’ MD. From 16,000’ MD to 19,500’ MD, the formation continued downward averaging an approximate 894 degree dip. From 20,000’ MD until TD formation came up ranging from 90 to 90.1 degrees. The best porosity and oil shows came immediately below the clean gamma marker at the center of the target window. Yellow green to green brown oil was often present on the shakers while in this zone, gas was also elevated which was another way of indicating where we were in zone. At 16,939’ MD we struck the Lower Bakken Shale and were forced to sidetrack back at 15,910’ MD. We realized we were targeting the clean below the shale instead of the clean just above the Three Forks Aquatard. We found that entering the target window from the bottom, at an angle close to the approximated formation dip would allow the bit to track formation easier. The P Vance 154-97-16-9-21-16H3 is the ﬁrst of four wells drilled on the pad. <br/>Kevin Busch Wellsite Geologist </p>

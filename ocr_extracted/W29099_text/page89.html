Drill rates in the Lodgepole averaged 0.78 minutes per foot rotating Samples were primarily limestone, light to medium gray brown, medium to dark gray, light grey in part, trace cream, off-white, crypto to microcrystalline, massive to blocky in habit, platy in part, moderately hard to soﬁ, trace to no visible porosity, pinpoint yellow ﬂuorescence, thin streaming cuts. Trace dark brown shale layers were observed in the beginning and towards the bottom of the formation. KOP was reached at 10,390’ MD. Oil shows were present in sample towards the bottom of the Lodgepole, however there was no return ﬂow over the shakers. Gas ranged ﬁom 112 to 685 total units. </p>

We cored from 10,738’ MD to 11,098’ MD (bottom of the Lodgepole through the Duperow formation. Drilling times while coring averaged 3.06 minutes per foot. We ﬁnished coring on December 14, 2014 where we tripped out of the hole to lay the core barrels down and tripped back into the hole to drill a 127’ rathole for the wireline logs. <br/>Curve 10,390’ — 11,850’ MD </p>

We began drilling the curve on December 19, 2014 at 10,390’ MD. Drilling times in the Lodgepole below KOP averaged 0.72 minutes per foot sliding. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the Lodgepole to correlate to the pilot hole. At KOP we kept our target at 10,907 ’ TVD‘ We landed the curve at 11,850’ MD, 10,910.75’ TVD. <br/>False Bakken 10,830’MD 10, 776’ TVD 8, 689 ’ SS <br/>The False Bakken came in six feet lower than prognosis at 10,830’ MD, 10,776’ TVD. The False Bakken was picked by the large spike in gamma at the base of the Lodgepole. Samples of limestone became much darker and argillaceous in this zone. Upon reaching the False Bakken we knew the rough thicknesses of each formation before reaching our Three Forks target, thus we kept our landing target to 10,907 ’ TVD. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Upper Bakken was entered at 10,788’ TVD. Upon entering the Upper Bakken shale gas raised in excess of 1000 total units. Background gas was consistently from 600 to 900 units in the package. A typical sample was shale, black, very dark gray, gray, dark brown, brown, ﬁrm to brittle, ﬁssile, massive, carbonaceous, waxy, earthy, scattered bright yellow ﬂuorescence, milky yellow cut. The Upper Bakken shale was twenty feet thick. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,886 ’ MD 10,809 ’ T VD 8, 722 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was entered at 10,809’ TVD. The Middle Bakken in this area is about forty seven feet thick and consists of a silty sandstone which is medium to dark gray, light gray, brown in part, platy, granular, ﬁrm to soft, subangular, moderately argillaceous, medium induration, limestone cementation, dolomitic, trace micrite, sucrosic on edges, samples had bright yellow ﬂuorescence, and instant milky streaming yellow cut. <br/>Lower Bakken 1 0, 966 ’ MD 10,856’ T VD 8, 769’ SS </p>

Upon entering the Upper Bakken shale gas raised in excess of 700 total units. Background gas was consistently from 500 to 700 units in the package. A typical sample was shale, black, very dark gray, gray, dark brown, brown, ﬁrm to brittle, ﬁssile, massive, carbonaceous, waxy, earthy, scattered bright yellow ﬂuorescence, milky yellow cut. The Lower Bakken shale was twenty eight feet thick. <br/>Three Forks 11,042’ MD 10,884’ T VD 8, 797’ SS <br/>At 11,042’ TVD the Three Forks was encountered. This top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The upper portion of the Three Forks exhibited dolomite that was light gray, gray tan, tan, slightly argillaceous, limestone in part, microcrystalline, moderate intergranular porosity, abundant silt, with scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, fast streaming yellow-green milky cut. Lower into the zone we encountered a ﬂat gray limy dolomite that had slightly larger crystals which slowed ROP and made sliding more difﬁcult. There was also a noticeable increase in ﬁne grained quartz siltstone. Fluorescence in this area was more abundant, even bright yellow and bright green. Cuts from this area in zone were thick and bright, oﬁen streaming from the reservoir rock, Pyrite became more abundant in the lower part of the zone, but was also seen often just </p>

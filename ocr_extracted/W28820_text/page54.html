The Simpson 151-102-5—8-10TFH was spudded on September 4, 2014 with surface drilled and cased to be resumed at a later date, Patterson 320 spudded the Simpson 151-102-5-8-10TFH on October 27, 2014 and reached a total depth of 20,786’ MD on December 3, 2014. Wellsite geological services began at 9,200 on October 29, 2014 at 3:00 PM MST. The initial phase of the Simpson 151-102—5-810TFH is a vertical and curve landing in the Three Forks Formation on October 24, 2014‘ The single lateral well targeting the Three Forks Formation approximately 11’-20 below the base of the Lower Bakken Shale was started on November 22, 2014. Thirty-foot samples were collected throughout the vertical and curve with ﬁfty foot samples collected in the lateral. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 9,200’ — 10,511 ’ MD </p>

Gas detection system was tested before logging depth with system functioning correctly. Drill rates before encountering the Base Last Salt ranged from 0.17-5.02 minutes per foot and averaging 0.81 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 11—135 units averaging 33 units. A typical sample was: LHVIESTONE: Light gray, gray, dark gray, brown, tan, cream, crypto-crystalline, argillaceous, carbonaceous, moderate to well induration, dolomitic, poor inter-granular porosity, anhydrite, pale yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming milky cut. <br/>Base of Last Salt 9,3 79 ’ MD 9,35 7’ TVD - 7,035 ’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was picked at the same depth as prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and differential pressure. Drill rates below the Base of the Last Salt ranged from 0.33—2.38 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 0.61 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 17 -123 units averaging 35 units. A typical sample was: LIMESTONE: Light gray, gray, dark gray, brown, tan, cream, white, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, carbonaceous, moderate to well induration, dolomitic, poor inter-granular porosity, anhydrite, trace salt, yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming milky cut. </p>

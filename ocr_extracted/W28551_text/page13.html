Additionally, BOP and casing strings will be tested to .22 psi/ft (gr 1 500 psi minimum) for 30 minutes prior to drilling out 9-5/8" and 7" casing. Rams and hydraulically operated remote choke line valve will be function tested daily at a minimum (preferably test at every crew change). <br/>5. Remote valve for BOP rams. HCR & choke shall be placed in a location that is readily available to the Driller. The remote BOP valve shall be capable of closing and opening the rams. <br/>6. Hand wheels on BOP shall be equipped with looking devices. A locking device shall be placed on annular preventer line valve & must be locked in the open position, This lock shall only be removed when the closing unit is inoperative. <br/>Drilling Fluid and Related Equipment <br/>1. Pumps shall be equipped with stroke counters with displays located in dog house.

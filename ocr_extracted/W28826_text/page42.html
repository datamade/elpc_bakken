Penetration rates through the False Bakken averaged around 90 — 100 ft/hr while sliding and around 80 - 90 ﬁ/hr while rotating. The lithology of the False Bakken exhibited a mixture of light to medium gray limestone and traces of dark gray shale present. Background gases through the False Bakken increased to around 700 — 800 units. The False Bakken was evaluated while drilling ahead. <br/>Scallion 11, 060’ MD 10,911 ’ TVD -8,630’ SS <br/>The Scallion was encountered at a measured depth of 11,060’, true vertical depth of 10,911’, three feet high to prognosis. After seeing the Scallion top the TVD target window remained at a true vertical depth of 10,950’ @ 90 degrees based off the isopaching ﬁom the Scallion to the Three Forks target area in the offset Skedsvold wells. Penetration rates through the Scallion averaged around 80 - 90 ft/hr while sliding and around 50 ft/hr while rotating. Background gases increased to around 700 — 800 units with the samples showing a light to medium gray/cream gray tan limestone with moderate dark gray to black shale present. The Scallion was drilled through from 10,911‘ to 10,920’ true vertical depth. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 11, 086’ MD 10,920’ TVD -8, 639’ SS <br/>The curve continued on through the remainder of the Scallion and the Upper Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,086’, true vertical depth of 10,920’, three feet high to prognosis. After seeing the Upper Bakken the TVD landing target remained at 10,945’ TVD. Once the Upper Bakken was encountered penetration rates increased ﬁom 80 ﬁ/hr to around 100 - 110 ﬁ/hr while sliding and rotating. Background gases averaged around 700 — 800 units through the Upper Bakken with the samples showing a black/brown black carbonaceous shale with occasional limestone present. The Upper Bakken was drilled through and the Middle Bakken was encountered. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,127’ MD 10,932 ’ TVD -8, 651 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 11,127’, true vertical depth of 10,932’, three feet high to prognosis. Penetration rates decreased in the Middle Bakken from around 100 ft/hr to around 70 - 80 ft/hr while sliding and rotating. The samples through the upper portion of the Middle Bakken exhibited a gray tan/gray brown dolomite with trace amounts of residual black shale and limestone present. Background gases through the Middle Bakken averaged around 700 — 800 units. Drilling continued on with the curve through the Middle Bakken up to a MD of 11,293'. The curve was landed around 22’ in the lower portion of the Middle Bakken with 90 degrees projected to the bit. <br/>The curve for the South lateral was landed at a measured depth of 11,293’ at 5:40 <br/>am. CST on November 3, 2014 with 90 degrees projected to the bit at a true vertical depth of 10,952’. Casing for the South Lateral was set at 11,273’ MD. </p>

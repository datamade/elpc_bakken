    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">A Gyro Data mud motor and Hughes bit were used for the South Lateral. The TIH began until tagging cement where the cement, Float & Shoe and ten feet of new formation were drilled to perform the FIT test. Aﬂer ﬁnishing with the FIT test drilling resumed with the South lateral with casing exited at a MD of 11,273’ at 1:40 am. CST on November 6, 2014. Drilling continued with the wellbore exiting casing at 89 degrees dropping about eight feet below the base of the Middle Bakken target interval seeing the C to D faces transition. Slides were done throughout the morning to begin working on the directional turn as well as to work on keeping the wellbore pointed up to begin building in TVD slowly back into the Middle Bakken target window. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 120 — 130 ft/hr while rotating and around 40 —— 50 ft/hr while sliding. Backgron gases averaged around 200 — 300 units with connection gases reaching as high as 336 units. The samples seen in the lower portion of the formation exhibited a cream gray tan/cream gray dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut </p>

Throughout the morning there were problems with the MWD tool while taking surveys and doubt in the conﬁdence of the azimuth as the numbers were changing between 2 to 3 degrees when re shooting surveys. The decision was made to TOOH at a MD of 11,756’. After getting out of the hole a new MWD tool was picked up and the Bit and Mud Motor were inspected before TIH. Once on bottom drilling resumed with the wellbore steadily building in rotary towards the base of the Middle Bakken target window with slides done to continue working on the directional turn. Penetration rates averaged around 110 — 130 ft/hr while rotating and around 30 - 40 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 300 — 400 units with connection gases reaching as high as 623 units. The samples seen throughout the lower portion of the Middle Bakken exhibited a cream gray/cream gray tan dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. </p>

Throughout the day slides were done for the directional turn which was ﬁnished aﬁer reaching 180 degrees. Surveys returned to every ninety feet and drilling continued with the wellbore slowly building in TVD throughout the night reaching the upper clean bench of at the top of the Middle Bakken target interval.

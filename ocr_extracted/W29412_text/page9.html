This 6.625” OD gathering line is a short piece of pipeline that connects the Sharon Rainey 1-17-20H—142-96 to a 12.75” OD gathering line. The 12.75” gathering line traverses approximately 3.5 miles and then connects to the inlet header at Hiland’s Manning Compressor Station located in Section 29, T142N, 96W, Dunn County, ND. The table below shows the estimated capacities and current flows of the gathering lines connecting this pad. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Hiland stated in a recent meeting that their gathering system in this area had sufﬁcient capacity to gather gas from wells Oxy currently plans on drilling on the dedicated acreage. Hiland further stated that the Manning compressor station was designed to allow for the installation of additional compressors when required as volume increases on the gathering system. <br/>Flowback Strateg <br/>After the fracture treatment, these wells will be ﬂowed through a choke to test production tanks. Choke size will depend on ﬁnal shut in pressure post frac and well pressure prior to opening the choke. The choke will be adjusted up or down based on ﬂowing pressure, liquid rates and sand returns, to prevent clogging manifold chokes. During ﬂowback, the water chlorides and sand content will be monitored. When the water chlorides are greater than 100,000 ppm and the produced ﬂuids contain no sand, the wells will be turned to production facilities. Since the pipeline is already at the location of the pad and Oxy will have its production facilities constructed before ﬂowback starts, and gas sales should start as soon as the wells start ﬂowing through the production facilities. Based on current information, it is our belief the system can take this gas upon completion of the four wells. <br/>The typical well on this pad is expected to initially ﬂow 500 barrels of oil and 225 thousand cubic feet of gas per day based on Oxy’s production type curve of this area. Based on current drilling and completion plans, these wells will be completed in the same timefrarne. For the four wells, Oxy projects a peak oil rate of 2,000 barrels and a peak gas rate of 900 thousand cubic feet per day from the pad. It is anticipated these wells will decline sharply after initial production as do the majority of horizontal wells in the Williston Basin. </p>

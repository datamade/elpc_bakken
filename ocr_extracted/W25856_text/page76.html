    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Bakken Shale was drilled at a TVD of 10,886ft. The shale was brownish black, with a slightly silty appearance. It was ﬁrm, slightly calcareous and subblocky to blocky. Occasional micro-pyrite was seen in the samples. The shale had spotty ﬂuorescence and a slow streaming cut. The penetration rate was less than 1 min/ft while in the shale. The background gas increased after ﬁrst getting into the shale to as high as 5,316 units, then gradually decreased to near 900 units. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,071ft MD 10,903ft T VD -8,949ft SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was ﬁrst encountered in samples at a TVD of 10,903ft. The samples were composed of Siltstone. It was medium gray to tan in color. It was moderately argillaceous, calcareous to limey in part, and had poor induration. The Siltstone had poor porosity, and interbedded dolomite. The dolomite was micro to very ﬁne grained, and limey and sucrosic in part. The samples had spotty dull yellow ﬂuorescence, and fast cloudy cuts. Background gas while drilling in the Middle Bakken Siltstone was near 800 units. Drilling within the Bakken continued to a measure depth of 11,220ﬂ. This was called TD of the curve at 6:28 PM CT January 13, 2015. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling of the lateral was started after seven inch casing was set at 11,200ft, and the drilling fluid was changed from oil based to salt water. The casing shoe was drilled out with a PDC bit, directional tools, and a 5” mudmotor. Upon drilling out into open formation, the background gas was near 600 units. The curve was landed with an inclination near 90.5 degrees, at a TVD of 10,923ﬁ. While drilling out laterally, slides for azimuth were used to turn the well path from 132 to 180 degrees. The ROP was near 350ft/hr while rotating. The turn was ﬁnished at a survey depth of 13,5 75ft. At this point, the survey intervals were increased from 44ft, to 88ft. While rotating, the inclination was <br/>building. This caused the need to slide down about every second stand. The ROP increased to near 450ﬁ/hr while rotating. The samples remained siltstone with <br/>interbedded dolomite, with little change. The background gas was near 1,300 units, with connection gases near 2,400 units. The well path started to track formational dip, allowing several hundred feet to be drilled between slides. The ROP increased to as high as 530ﬁ/hr. This combination allowed for 4032ft to be drilled in 24 hours. </p>

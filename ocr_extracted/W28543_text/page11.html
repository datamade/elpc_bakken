At 11:30 am, upon entering the Upper Bakken Shale, the string was stacking weight. We washed pipe through the shale to 11,415’ (MD) where the hole packed off, and pipe was stuck. For the next 12 hours, rig tried working pipe free with no success. During this time; one joint of pipe was laid down. <br/>Richard Dunn (ﬁeld inspector) was notified of the perforating and cement plan to perf 40 measured depth feet above the upper Bakken shale. The perf depth is also 40 measured depth feet below the Top of Pool. We perfed at 3:00 am on 12/2/2014 from 11,260’—11,262', with 4 shots per foot at 60 degree phasing. <br/>Once we pulled out of hole with the perf guns, we immediately established circulation from 1.5 bpm to 3 bpm to prepare for the cement job. The casing was cemented with 270 sacks of 11.8# Econocem lead cement followed by 430 sacks of 14# Extendacem tail cement. Displacement was 145 barrels short. Estimated TOC @5300' <br/>12/3/2014 We will tested casing before we drilled out cement, after tagging the cement top. We got a charted test to 1500 psi for 30 minutes. We then ramped up to 3500 psi for ten minutes. Test was also good. From there we drilled out our perfs and tested them to 1500 psi. We were testing with the rig pumps, our ﬁrst test we lost 113 psi. Our second test 118 psi was lost. After calling Richard Dunn, he said that is below the 10% threshold, and since we were using our mud pump, the amount of pressure we lost was normal. He gave the OK to drill ahead. <br/>Plan forward: we will continue to drill out cement, and drill lateral as per original well plan. After TD is reached, we will run a CBL and report TOC. From there, we will run in hole with the completion liner. The liner hanger will be set above the perforations at 10,509’ (MD) Two swell packers will be placed at 11,580’ and 11,638’ for shoe isolation purposes. Original 8—3/4" open hole was drilled to a MD of 11,557’ <br/>—E_ ma 185.76 man 197-89 11139 217-15 11148 228-81 m 260-52 <br/>                      <br/>      </p>

KOG is willing to plant trees near the well site to enhance the view to the shed area. Steel baliards will be placed on the crossing that will stop any trucks from turning off of the lease road onto County Rd 15. K06 is willing to have securityltraffic guard stationed where the lease road will cross County Rd 15 during the drilling and completion operations. This will aid in trafﬁc control and prevent heavy trucks from driving on County Rd 15. Gas Disposition: The P Wood wells will be connected to a dedicated ONEOK 14" line which will mOVe gas to the Epping Station. There is currently 7—8 MMcf of additional capacity at the Epping Station. ONEOK is building a compressor station S of Stockyard Creek to take 30 Mind and free up capacity at Epplng. This is anticipated to come on line Aug. 2014, before completion of the P Wood wells. Therefore, these will be hooked up upon completion, limiting ﬂaring to short-term emergency situations. (odiak will mitigate operational noise by doing the following: a. Requiring mufflers on all operating equipment, no straight pipes are allowed. b. Minimize the use of air horns, especially during the night. 0. Minimize the clanging of pipe by use of pad drilling. We, will pick up and rack all usable iubulars as will ﬁt in the derrick. Parking forklifts so that the ﬁrst movcment is always forward to minimize backing indicators. e.

Sum all the individual well “ heoretical Monthl Oil Production” volumes to determine the “Total <br/>Theoretical Monthly Oil Production” for the central production facility. Calculate a sales factor by dividing the total “Actual Monthly Oil Sales” by the “Total Theoretical <br/>Monthly Oil Production” volumes for the central production facility corrected as necessary for any time well was producing but measurement was not operational. <br/>Determine “Allocated Monthly Oil Production” for each well by multiplying the respective individual well “Theoretical Monthly Oil Production" volume by the sales factor calculated in step (e) above. <br/>LACT meter used in the measurement will be proved according to the section below entitled “Current EOG Oil Sales LACT Proving”. Well oil allocation meters will be proved on a quarterly basis using either a positive displacement <br/>prover loop or from a test tank. Volumes will be reported to appropriate agencies through routine oil production reports filed monthly. <br/>Current EOG Oil Sales LACT Proving: The time between LACT proving depends on the amount of oil sold through the LACT. It is the same for pipeline LACTs and truck LACTs as follows: a) LACT ships 2,000 bbls or more in a month: LACT proved every month, b) LACT ships less than 2,000 bbls in a month: LACT is proved every quarter. 0) In addition, to establish a comparative meter factor for a new LACT, the initial proving is followed by a second proving a month later, regardless of how much oil is shipped through <br/>the LACT for that month. <br/>Gas Continuous Measurement: Individual Well “Monthly Well GAS PRODUCTION”: <br/>8) <br/>Volumes of gas shall be metered at a dedicated single well separator/treater (at central facility) using either orifice plate or v-cone and Electronic Flow Measurement (EFM). <br/>Gas Continuous Measurement: Individual Well “Allocated Monthly Well GAS SALE ” (lf Gas Sales Are Active): <br/>3) <br/>b) <br/>0) <br/>Volumes of gas shall be metered at a dedicated single well separator/treater (at central facility) using either orifice plate or v-cone and Electronic Flow Measurement (EFM).

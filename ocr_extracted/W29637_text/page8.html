    <p class="styleSans480.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">690 N8 . . . . . 9 "mm Commingled Production Allocation Method for "Continuous Measurement” Locations <br/>EOG Resources, lnc. is requesting approval to commingle production from the following wells: <br/>Parshall 24-3332H (Well File # 29637), Surface location T152N, R90W, 5th P.M. Mountrail County Parshall 27-3332H (Well File # 29636), Surface location T152N, R90W, 5th P.M. Mountrail County Parshall 164-3332H (Well File # 29635), Surface location T152N, R90W, 5“1 PM. Mountrail County <br/>The above wells will use “Continuous Measurement” and as a group have common ownership. Continuous measurement for above wells will be located at the “Parshall Section 33 SESW” central production facility to be constructed on the same pad of where the wellheads are located. <br/>Each well will flow into a single separator/treater located at the Central Facility where oil, water, and gas will be separated and continuous measurement used on each well as follows: <br/>1) Per well continuous measurement oil volumes will be used to allocate actual stock tank oil volumes delivered through central facility commingled “oil sales” LACT back to individual well(s). Oil device will be Coriolis meter using Electronic Flow Measurement (EFM) and appropriate industry and manufacturer standards. Each well will have a tank that can be isolated and used as a test tank for the proving of its Coriolis meter. <br/>2) Per well continuous measurement of gas volumes will be used to allocate actual standard condition gas volumes delivered through central facility “gas sales" meters back to individual well(s). Gas measurement device will be either orifice plate or wedge meters using EFM and appropriate industry and manufacturer standards. <br/>3) Per well continuous measurement water volumes will be used to allocate actual water volumes transported out of central facility back to individual well(s). Water device will be Vortex Shedding, Electro-Magnetic, or Turbine using EFM and appropriate industry and manufacturer standards. <br/>Please reference, 1) A map showing the location of the central facility and the location of each well, 2) The Facilities Commingling Diagram, 3) A list of the manufacturer, size and type of meters to be used, and 4) the Commingled Production Allocation Method to be used to determine individual well production. <br/>  </p>

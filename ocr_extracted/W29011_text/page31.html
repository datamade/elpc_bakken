A mud log will be mn from Base of Last Salt to TD & on all laterals: Mudlog to include: total gas chromatograph and sample <br/>cuttings - 30' sample intervals in vertical hole & 30‘ intervals in laterals. A CBUGR log will be run from deepest free—fall depth in 7 inch casing to surface. An MWD GR/ROP log will also be run from KOP (where the CBL will tie into) to TD of lateral. 2. Open hole logs are Not anticipated <br/>3. No DST's are planned at this time. <br/>H25 All H25 related safety equipment must be installed tested and operational at a depth of 500 feet above, or 3 days pnor l0 penetrating the ﬁrst zone <br/>expected to contain H28 [whichever cogﬁs ﬁrst). Maximum Formation Pressure and Temp 1. Normal formation pressure gradient is expected (up to 0.5 psi/ft or 9.6 ppg) from surface to the Bakken Shale. The Bakken Shale. Bakken Middle Member. and Three Forks may be over pressured up as much as 0.66 psi/ft (12.8 ppg). <br/>2, The maximum anticipated BHT is 260 degrees F. or less. <br/>BOP Equipment Requirements See attached diagram detailing BOPE speciﬁcations. 1. Rig will be equipped with upper and lower kelly cocks with handles available. <br/>2. Inside BOP and TlW valves will be available to use on all sizes and threads of DP used on well. <br/>3. BOP accumulator will have enough capacity to close HCR valve. close all rams plus annular prevenler & retain minimum of 200 psi above precharge on the closing manifold without the use of closing pumps. The ﬂuid reservoir capacity shall be at least double the usable ﬂuid volume of the accumulator system capacity & the ﬂuid level shall be mainatained at manufacturer recommendation. There will be 2 additional sources of power for the closing pumps (electric and air). Sufﬁcient N2 bottles will be available and will be recharged when pressure falls below manufacturers minimum <br/>4. BOP ram preventers will be tested to 5,000 psi for 10 minutes using a test plug when initially installed and after 7 inch casing is nippled up and at 30 day intervals. Test EDP & casing strings to .22 psi/ft (or 1500 psi minimum! for 30 minutes. prior to drilling out 9-5/ “ and 7" casing. Function test rams and hydraulically operated remote choke line valve daily (preferably at every crew change). <br/>5. Remote valve for BOP rams, HCR & choke shall be placed in a location that is readily available to Driller. The remote BOP valve shall be capable of closing and opening the rams. <br/>6. Hand wheels on BOP shall be equipped with locking devices. A locking device shall be placed on annular prevemer line valve & must be locked in the open position. This lock shall only be removed when the closing unit is inoperative. <br/>7. BOP shall be tested when - a.) Initially installed b.) Any seal is broken or BOP is repaired c.) Previous test exceeds 30 days <br/>Drilling Fluid and Related Equipment <br/>1, Pumps shall be equipped with stroke counters with displays located in dog house. Slow pump speed shall be recorded on drilling report daily after mudding up. <br/>2. A Pit Volume Totalizer will be Installed and the readout will be displayed in the dog house. <br/>3. Gas detecting equipment (for a chromatagraph) will be installed at shaker. Readouls will be available in dog house and in geologist trailer. <br/>4. In the event gas flow becomes an issue. Aflare pit shall be constructed not less than 100' from wellhead 8. 50’ from cuttings handling area. Lines to the ﬂare pit will be straight runs (staked clown) and turns will utilize targeted tees. Flare pit will be located down wind as much as possible. An electronic ignitor will be used along with a propane line to provide for a continuous ﬂare pilot. <br/>Drilling Plan Section 1 - Surface Casing» Surface to: 1,960 (Surface Casing Depth + 20) Conductor: 16" set at 45' - 80' (depending on gravel or coal depths) </p>

A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Light gray brown, medium gray, cream gray, wackestone to packstone, slightly argillaceous, ANHDRITE: 25% cream gray, white, gummy, poor to moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered dull yellow ﬂuorescence, good cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Rival 9,980’MD 9,975 ’ T VD - 7,322 ’ SS </p>

The Rival was picked using gamma signatures and lithology changes. The samples in the upper portion of the Rival were as follows; LIMESTONE: Gray, medium to dark gray brown, light brown, micritic to packstone, slightly argillaceous, carbonaceous in part, 10% off white anhydrite, poor to moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, spotty dull yellow white ﬂuorescence, fair cloudy yellow <br/>cut. </p>

The Lodgepole Formation was picked from using gamma signatures along with a lithology changes. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Light to medium gray, light gray brown, off white, wackestone to <br/>packstone, argillaceous, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered yellow white fluorescence, cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Curve I0,875’—11,767’MD <br/>The curve was started at a kick off point of 10,875’ measured depth, 356’ below the Lodgepole. The bit and bottom hole assembly were changed out for a directional assembly at 10,875’ measured depth for drilling the curve. Penetration rate of the curve averaged 0.68 min/ft. The BHA was pulled on December 6, 2014 due to slow ROP. The BHA #4 was changed out at 11,561’ MD. The Curve was landed on December 7,2014 at 4:30 AM. CST, 16 feet into <br/>the Middle Bakken Formation at a true vertical depth of 1 1,418.39’. Casing was completed on December 8,2014. </p>

The lithology of the False Bakken consisted of limestone. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Medium gray, gray brown, cream gray, tan, wackestone to packstone, argillaceous, soft to fair induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered yellow green ﬂuorescence, fair cloudy yellow green cut. </p>

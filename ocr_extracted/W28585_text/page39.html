A typical sample was as follows; SHALE: Black, dark brown, pyritic, silty in part, platy to blocky, trace porosity, moderate induration, scattered dull yellow ﬂuorescence, streaming to good cloudy yellow green cut. Drill rates through the Upper Bakken averaged 0.63 min/ft. The gas entering the Shale was a max of 449 units. The inclination of the curve through the Upper Bakken Shale was approximately 68 - 73 degrees. </p>

Samples at this time exhibited trace oil shows and a typical sample was as follows; SANDSTONE: Light gray, light brown, dark gray to black, clear to translucent, very ﬁne to ﬁne grained, subrounded to rounded, moderately to well sorted, calcareous, slightly argillaceous, trace fair intergranular porosity, even yellow green ﬂuorescence, good cloudy blue <br/>green cut. Gas in the Middle Bakken averaged 1,800 units. The Middle Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 1 1,618’ and a true vertical <br/>depth of 11,402’. Samples at this time exhibited trace oil shows and a typical sample was as follows SANDSTONE: Gray, medium gray, light brown, clear to translucent, very ﬁne to ﬁne grained, subrounded to rounded, moderately to well sorted, calcareous, slightly argillaceous, fair intergranular porosity, spotted yellow green ﬂuorescence, good cloudy yellow green cut. Fair gas and oil shows were observed in the Middle Bakken particularly in the middle of the target window with gamma in the 50 - l 10 API range. This interval just above the target line is characterized by a lithology consisting of fairly clean, very ﬁne to ﬁne grained, subrounded to rounded, moderately to well sorted, calcareous, slightly argillaceous sandstone. Below the target window, in the lower porosity and weaker gas and oil shows <br/>Seven lateral target changes were done to follow formation changes. Dip angle was calculated from gamma markers and correlations with other wells using data provided by Hess and Neset Consulting. Gas values ranged from 1 l — 9,800 units throughout the Middle Bakken, averages throughoth the lateral were 350 — 9,200 units. Several gas tests were done to ensure the <br/>accuracy of the equipment. The lateral was drilled in ﬁve days, with one bit, and bottom hole assembly. The end of <br/>the well bore is located approximately 20’ into the Middle Bakken Formation at 20,926’ measured depth and a projected true vertical depth of 11,455.56’. <br/>Conclusion </p>

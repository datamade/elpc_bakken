Once finish grade was established, a milling machine was used to combine commercial grade Portland cement with sub-grade. The milling machine pulverized and mixed the soil and cement together at a depth of 8". Water was added to milling process, as necessary, to meet optimum moisture content of soil. <br/>Once milling process was complete, a smooth drum roller compacted milled material into place. A motor grader then established final surface grade. <br/>Affected area was then left untouched for approximately 24 hours to allow for curing process of treated area. <br/>  <br/>Company Telephone Number Hess Bakken Investments ll, LLc 701-420-6900 FOR STATE USE ONLY Address <br/>3015 16th Street SW, Suite 20 <br/>City Zip Code Minot 58701 <br/>Signature _/ , Printed Name @629 We ’7’.

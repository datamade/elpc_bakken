    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Hess Corporation, LK-A QTR CIR—147—96—1807H-6 was drilled as a single lateral horizontal well targeting the Middle Bakken Formation. The target zone was a ten foot thick window existing approximately ﬁfteen feet below the Upper Bakken Shale. The ground elevation is 2,627” above sea level with a Kelly Bushing of 26’ to make the total KB at 2,653”. This well is located in Section 18 T147N R96W Dunn County, North Dakota. The LK-A QTR CIR-147-96-1807H-6 was spudded on November 30, 2014 and reached a total depth for the vertical hole and curve at 11,767’ measured depth and 1 1,418’ true vertical depth on December 7, 2014, 8 days from spud. <br/>Total depth of the LK-A QTR ClR—l47-96-1807H-6 lateral was reached at 20,926’ measured depth on December 13, 2014 at 11:00 P.M. CDT. The bottom hole location is 384.51 ’ FNL and 2,41 1.91 ’ FWL, Section 7 T147N R96W. This well was drilled using an invert based mud system for the vertical / curve, and saline-rich salt water for the lateral. Tim Purdy and Devin Pays of Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided the Well Site Geo-steering, Mud Logging and Gas Detection Services beginning at a depth of 9,030’ in the Kibbey Lime through the total depth in the Three Forks Formation. The services were provided through the curve and lateral portion of the Three Forks Formation. Samples were caught from lagged depths at intervals <br/>between 10 — 100’. <br/>Kibbey Lime 9,036’ MD 9,032 ’ TVD -6,3 79’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Kibbey Lime Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,036’ and a true vertical depth of 9,032’, which was eighteen feet higher than the prognosis. A typical sample was as follows LIMESTONE: Brown, red, rust, tan, wackestone, argillaceous, trace carbonaceous, poorly to moderately indurated, scattered dull yellow white ﬂuorescence, slow pinpoint streaming to cloudy yellow cut. <br/>Charles 9,190’MD 9,186’ TVD -6,533’ SS <br/>The Madison Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,190’ and a true vertical depth of 9, l 86’, which was seventeen feet higher than the prognosis. A typical sample <br/>was as follows; ANHYDRITE: Gray, buff, light tan, pasty, very soft, ﬁne grained, poor porosity, trace limestone, Halite 30%, clear frosted, rounded to sub rounded, trace red brown <br/>siltstone, faint cloudy to thick streaming cut. Base of Last Salt 9, 774’ MD 9, 770’ T VD - 7,11 7’ SS <br/>The Base of Last the Salt was encountered at a measured depth of 9,774’ and a true vertical depth of 9,770’, which was sixteen feet higher than the prognosis. A typical sample was as follows; HALITE: Translucent to white, light brown, light gray, 30% anhydrite, light gray, tan, off white, angular to subangular, blocky, poor induration, no visible porosity, even dull yellow-white fluorescence, no cut. </p>

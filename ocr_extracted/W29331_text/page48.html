    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>Lodgepole 10,344' MD 10,286' TVD -7,967' SS <br/>The top of the Lodgepole was picked at 10,344’ MD; -7,967’ SS from the samples changing from a light to medium brown to a medium to dark gray. Typical samples were a limestone consisting of medium gray, dark gray, light brown, packstone to wackestone, microcrystalline, ﬁrm to hard, very calcareous, slightly argillaceous, poor intergranular porosity, yellow green ﬂuorescence, with a weak cloudy cut <br/>Curve 10,816’—-11,497’MD <br/>The Curve began on November 15th, 2014. KOP was at 10,816’ MI) and 10,739’ TVD. This depth is 453 feet TVD into the Lodgepole formation. Drilling times ranged from 0.2 to 5.4 min/ﬂ; and averaged 0.79 min/ﬂ. Gas averaged 101 units with values as high as 741 units. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the curve to correlate with the Wisness 150-100-23-14-6H well. <br/>Upper Bakken 11,301 ' MD 11,075 ' TVD -8, 756' SS <br/>The top of the Upper Bakken was picked at 11,075’ TVD; -8,756’ SS from the samples changing from medium to dark gray limestone to a black to dark brown shale. Shale sample was black to dark brown, very carbonaceous, slightly silty, and blocky. Sample had a very dark brown ﬂuorescence and an instant blooming milky cut. It was also picked by a drop in differential pressure and correlating gamma markings. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,359’ MD 11,093’ T VD -8, 774' SS <br/>At 11,092’ TVD the Middle Bakken was encountered. This top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The Middle Bakken exhibited a Dolomite that was medium gray to tan gray, light gray, silty in part, microcrystalline, sub-rounded to subangular, carbonaceous, argillaceous, calcareous, moderate induration, good to fair intercrystalline porosity, scattered green to pinpoint yellow ﬂuorescence, with a bright cloudy cut. <br/>Horizontal 11,497’ —- 20,687’ MD <br/>The Horizontal section was started, using brine water, in the Middle Bakken Formation at 7:05 AM CDT on November 18th, 2014. Drilling times ranged from 0.1 to 6.8 min/ft Gas averaged 711 units with values as high as 2,817 units. Gamma was monitored and correlated to calculate formation dips throughout the Lateral. <br/>The ﬁrst section of the Lateral was drilled following a local calculated dip of 89.9 to 89.48 degrees. The well bore followed local formation dip along the “Ratty Marker” illustrated on the Well Tracker. The turn for azimuth was started at 12,660’ MD to bring the well bore to 0 degrees. Around 13,000’ MD the well bore encountered a hard streak that exhibited trace to moderate amounts of pyrite. The assembly deﬂected downward off of this hard streak until approximately 14,500’ MD. </p>

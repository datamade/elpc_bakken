Mud Program <br/>a. The proposed circulating mediums to be employed in drilling are as follows: <br/>Loss 0’—2,175’ 8.4—9.2 28—36 8.5—9.5 2,175’—11,442’ Oil Based Mud 9.6 — 16 - 24 10.2 11,442’ — Brine 9.4 — 40 - 55 20.692’ 10.5 Sufﬁcient mud materials to maintain mud properties, control lost circulation, and contain <br/>“kicks” will be available at the wellsite. An example “General” mud program is attached to this application for reference. <br/>                <br/>Interval <br/>   <br/>  <br/>  <br/>           <br/>4. Evaluation Program <br/>The anticipated type and amount of testing, logging, and coring are as follows: <br/>None anticiated; No drill stem tests are anticiated <br/>Cuttins samles will be collected eve 30’ to 50’; Top of Charles to TD. <br/>MWD as needed to land wellbore; 100’ sample interval in the vertical portion of the <br/>wellbore, 45’ sample interval through the curve section, and 90’ samples throughout The logging program will consist of the following: <br/>        <br/>  <br/>        <br/>         <br/>the lateral. Survey interval may be decreased as needed to steer wellbore but will not be increased above the lenths listed above <br/>        <br/>           <br/>    <br/>Base of surface casin to KOP. GR to surface Cement Bond Log On intermediate casin <br/>TD to Surface MWD — GR Throuh Curve and Lateral <br/>The anticipated completion program is as follows: <br/>       <br/>Triple Combo <br/>          <br/>  <br/>  <br/>- After drilling the Bakken lateral, a 4-1/2” production liner will be run from above KOP, inside the 7” intermediate casing, out to TD of the lateral and cemented. Lateral stimulation will consist of multiple frac stages, consisting of a slick water or hybrid system with proppant. All ﬁ'ac stages will be pumped down a “tie-back” string of 4—1/2” casing of similar or stronger weight and grade to that of the liner. The tie back string will be run from surface to the top of the production liner and will provide pressure isolation during fracture stimulation. <br/>5. Abnormal Pressures and H28 Gas <br/>No abnormal pressures or temperatures or other hazards are anticipated. HZS gas is not expected to be encountered in this wellbore, but precautions will be taken to monitor for the presence of HZS while drilling. <br/>     </p>

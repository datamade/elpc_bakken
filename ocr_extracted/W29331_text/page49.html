The assembly crossed below the pyrite hard streak around 15,300’ MD, and continued to deﬂect downward for the next 1,000’ MD. At 16,300’ MD, the assembly was steered upward to create separation from the hard streak. <br/>The last section of the Lateral remained mostly flat. The assembly continued to climb in TVD until the bit deﬂected off of the “Cool” gamma illustrated by a blue line on the Well Tracker. From this point, the well bore descended in TVD to just after 18,000’ MD. When coming back up, a hard streak was encountered that caused a 2.37 degree deﬂection down, and a 2.38 degree deﬂection left. The samples contained the most amount of pyrite experienced in the well being around 10-20%. The assembly was navigated upward and the well reached TD in the middle of zone. <br/>The entirety of the Lateral was drilled in the target window 10-20’ TVD into the <br/>Middle Bakken. The geology was mostly Dolomite which was gray brownto gray, light brown, light cream gray in part, dark beige, with trace to moderate pyrite in localized zones, microcrystalline, subrounded to subangular, calcareous, carbonaceous, argillaceous, moderate to well induration, fair to good intercrystalline porosity, even dull green to trace yellow ﬂuorescence, with a rapid cloudy cut <br/>Throughout the Lateral, we experienced an average dip of 89.85 degrees. The well was drilled entirely in the desired window, and shale was not encountered throughout the Lateral. The Geo-steering Plan was communicated and carried out according to local calculated dips. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Wisness 150-100-23-14-7H well reached a total measured depth of 20,687 feet. The curve was executed 2’ TVD within the planned target. Throughout the entire Lateral, gas averaged 711 units with values as high as 2,817 units. The wellbore was in the planned target zone for the majority of the well and the Geo-steering Plan was carried out according to local calculated dip angles. The casing point was landed 14’ TVD into the Middle Bakken Formation. The Lateral was drilled mainly 10-20’ TVD into the Middle Bakken, with no shale strikes. The Wisness 150-100—23-14-7H well was drilled in 14.5 days. <br/>Jesse F reborg Well site Geologist </p>

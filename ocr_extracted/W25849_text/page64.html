    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation’s Elsie Bartleson Federal #14-16TFX is a horizontal well targeting the Three Forks formation, to be drilled in an east southeast direction at a vertical section azimuth of 104.22 degrees for approximately 9,956 feet vertical section. The well is located in the SW %, SW ‘A, Section 29, Township 153N, Range 92W of Mountrail County, northwest of New Town, North Dakota. <br/>This well spud in on December 31“, 2014 at 6:00 PM CST. Well site geological services began at 8,550 feet measured depth on January 8”, 2015 at 8:30 AM CST. Ten, ﬁﬁeen, <br/>thirty, and ﬁfty~foot lagged samples were caught by mud loggers and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>A thirteen and one half inch wellbore was drilled to 2,147 feet measured depth, and nine and ﬁve eighths inch casing was run and cemented in place. The remaining vertical wellbore and curve was drilled, and seven inch intermediate casing was ran and set at 10,755 feet measured depth. Two six inch hits were used while drilling lateral number one. Neset Consulting Service, Inc. Total gas hotwire monitoring system was used for the duration of logging services. <br/>The Elsie Bartleson Federal #14-16TFX vertical wellbore. with original curve, reached a total depth of 10,770 feet measured depth shortly before 2:00 AM CST on January 12TH, 2014, approximately 27 feet into the Three Forks, 12 days from spud. Horizontal leg began shortly before 11:00 PM CST on January 13”, 2015, reaching a total measured depth of 20,150 feet on January 18TH, 2015 shortly before 6:30 PM CST, 18 days from spud. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Logging services began at 8,550 feet measured depth in the Charles formation at 8:30 AM CST on January 8”, 2015. Charles consisted primarily of anhydrite, limestone and interlaminated dolomitic lenses, along with trace to moderate reddish orange shale. Drill rates ranged from one to two minutes per foot. Background gas averaged 11 to 15 units. Base of the last salt was picked at 8673 feet measured depth, 8,672 feet true vertical depth, with no signiﬁcant drill break, but conﬁrmed by gamma. Samples following consisted primarily of limestone. anhydrite, and minor dolomite. with a varying presence of shale through the Mission Canyon. <br/>Mission Canyon 8,848’ MD 8,84 7’ TVD -6, 762’ SS <br/>Mission Canyon was picked at 8,848 feet measured depth, 8847 feet true vertical depth. The Mission Canyon consisted of predominantly light to medium cream gray. rnicrocrystalline, fairly argillaceous limestone. off white to cream white anhydrite and light tan micro to cryptocrystalline dolomite. Drill rates averaged .5 to 1.1 minutes per foot through the Mission Canyon, with 11 to 15 units of average background gas. Even white mineral ﬂuorescence and slow, pinpoint streaming cut present in majority of samples caught. Due to low gas readings, a bump test was performed at the shakers and confirmed correct operation of gas equipment. <br/>Lodgepole 9,524 ’ MD 9,523 ’ TVD -7,438’ SS <br/>Lodgepole was picked at 9,524 feet measured depth, 9,523 feet true vertical depth using MWD gamma data. Drill rates averaged .8 minutes per foot in the initial portion of the Lodgepole. Background gas continued to average 11 to 15 units through the Lodgepole. An additional bump gas test was successfully performed on the evening of January 8 after background gas continued to average 11 units. </p>

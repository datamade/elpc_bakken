    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Kick off point was selected within the Lodgepole at 9,860 feet measured depth, and was reached shortly after 3:00 AM CST on January 9“, 2015. A trip was performed, and the curve assembly, including a Baker TX505 bit was picked up and tripped in the hole. Drilling of the curve began shortly before 8:00 PM CST on January 9TH, 2015. <br/>Correlations were made with the Elmer Bartleson #14-29TFX as well as the Smith #14-29XH MWD logs using seven individual Lodgepole correlative markers and formation tops. The initial landing target based on the geological prognosis was set at 10,446 feet true vertical depth. Prior to beginning the curve, based on the Lodgepole top, the landing target was dropped to 10,450 feet true vertical depth. Following the Three Forks top, the target was again dropped to 10,460 feet true vertical depth. Typical samples in the lower Lodgepole consisted of light to medium gray, brown, gray tan, cream, cream gray, medium tan to tan, light br0wn, very ﬁne to microcrystalline, slightly argillaceous limestone, with trace anhydrite, and scattered light brown oi1 staining. </p>

The Scallion was logged at 10,359 feet measured depth, 10,307 feet true vertical depth Background gas increased to a peak of 387 units following the Scallion and into the Upper Bakken. <br/>Upper Bakken 10,3 77’ MD 10,31 9 ’ T VD -8,234 ’ SS <br/>Upper Bakken was reached at 10,377 feet measured depth; 10,319 feet true vertical depth with drill rates ranging from .6 to 1.2 minutes per foot. Background gas averaged 250 to 300 units through the Upper Bakken. Samples consisted of dark gray to black, bloclq', carbonaceous shale, with trace amounts of dolomite and limestone, with a scattered yellow green ﬂuorescence, and instant cloudy, slow streaming yellow green cut, with cut drying to a good yellow gold ﬂuorescence halo, and under white light, gradually turning strong amber. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,404’ MD 10,336 ’ TVD -8,251 ’ SS <br/>Middle Bakken was picked at 10,404 feet measured depth; 10,336 feet true vertical depth marked by a drop in penetration rates, and transition from shale to dolomitic, silty limestone noted in samples. Samples consisted of predominately medium to dark gray, gray brown, light gray, moderately dolomitic, argillaceous, slightly pyn'tic, platy siltstone with poor induration, and heaVy dark gray argillaceous banding. Also present was up to 50 percent light to medium brown, light gray, very ﬁnely grained to silty, sub angular to sub rounded sandstone that was poorly to moderately sorted and poor to fair calcitic cementation. Samples transitioned to predominately siltstone following <br/>10,430 feet measured depth, marked by an increase in average gamma from the 45 to 60 to between 90 and 110 API range. Background gas averaged 150 units through the Middle Bakken. <br/>Lower Bakken 10, 503 ’ MD 10,393 ’ T VD -8,308’ SS <br/>Lower Bakken was picked at 10,503 feet measured depth; [0,393 feet true vertical depth, with a sharp increase in gamma, and transition of samples from siltstone to black, light to medium gray, tan gray, cream gray, off white, smooth to gritty carbonaceous shale, with trace to moderate light cream gray microcrystalline dolomite. Drill rates in the Lower Bakken averaged l to 2.5 minutes per foot, with an average 450 units of background gas. </p>

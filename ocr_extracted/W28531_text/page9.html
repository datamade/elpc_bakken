Since the permits were issued under conﬁdential status, the Commission cannot share the stipulations herein, although the Commission believes such stipulations address your concerns. <br/>I visited with Mr. Loren Jepson this morning on the phone and one of our inspectors has also visited with Mr. Jepson twice at the proposed well locations. Another on-site meeting between the Commission and Mr. Jepson is scheduled for Tuesday morning (September 3, 2014). <br/>The Commission intends to further monitor progress of the site construction to ensure the permit stipulations are met. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact this ofﬁce. <br/>Sincerely, <br/>Bruce E. Hicks Assistant Director <br/>cc: Josh Dilloway—Hess Bakken Investments II, LLC <br/>600 E Boulevard Ave - Dept 405.

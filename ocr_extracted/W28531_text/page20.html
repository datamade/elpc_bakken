Hess Corporation 600 East Boulevard Ave. 417 109th Ave SW Dept. 405 Killdeer, ND 58640 Bismarck, ND 58505-840 <br/>jdilowax@hess.com bhicks@nd.gov <br/>Dear Messrs. Diloway and Hicks, <br/>1 represent Loren Jepson, an owner of property adjacent to the LK-Trotterl46-97—3625H2, H3 and H6 wells. This letter is being sent as a means of sending formal notice to Hess and the NDIC of activity that will result in damages to Mr. Jepson’s Property. The current location of the well site is directly in—line with an existing waterway and particularly susceptible to the movement of surface water from run off. <br/>This area of Dunn County has a soil composition that is highly crodible. Repeated requests and suggestions have been made to Hess seeking reasonable alternative locations for the well site that is less likely to result in property damage due to run off from rain fall. These requests have gone barely acknowledged and ignored by Hess. <br/>Construction began on the well site today, and a ﬁnal attempt to mitigate damages was sought by requesting that dikes be built surrounding the well pad to alleviate the movement of soil in the event of rain. These suggestions have also been ignored. When damages occur due to run off from the well site onto Jepson’s property, Mr. Jepson will be seeking the maximum damages available as well as for Hess’ wanton disregard and failure to mitigate damages. Hess will be required to compensate Mr. J cpson for damages that occur but will also require that mitigation. factors be implemented to prevent further damages. <br/>This is a last attempt to have Hess and NDIC review the permit to avoid damages that will be inevitable. <br/>on):de </p>

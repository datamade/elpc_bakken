    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Marker over the course of the ﬁrst 300 feet measured depth. Gamma below the upper marker averaged 70 API with samples consisting of a cream to tan cream sub rounded to rounded silty dolomite. Gas averaged 1,000 units with connection gas averaging 2,200 units. At 10,107’ MD (TVD of 9,327’ TVD) the upper gamma marker was reexamined and yielded a local dip of 89.45 degrees. Due to the observation of the gamma marker the target was revised at 10,000’ MD between 9,329‘-9,339 TVD and extended to 11,000’ MD between 9,333” TVD and 9,343’ TVD. <br/>Between 10,255’ MD and 10,531’ MD thirty foot surveys were taken as a tangent curve was built changing the azimuth from 307 degrees to 320 degrees. During the turn the wellbore went above the prescribed target area reaching a TVD of 9,330’ and maintaining a position above the upper gamma marker until 11,109’ MD. Gamma above the upper gamma marker averaged 74 to 84 API. Gas rose to average 3,500 units with high levels of heavy gases. When the upper gamma marker was breached a dip calculation of 89.81 degrees resulted. The target window was adjusted to between 9,335’ TVD and 9,345’ TVD at 11,000’ measure depth and extended to 9,331 ’ TVD and 9,341 ’ TVD at 12,000’ MD. The slight up dip of the target window would help ensure the avoidance of a Lower Bakken Shale strike and help to conﬁrm a flat dip. <br/>The wellbore maintained a position within the prescribed target window up to 12,000’ MD. During this section of the wellbore gamma averaged 70 AH with samples consisting of a clean sucrosic, sub rounded to rounded, frosted dolomite with a ﬁne mossy green oil sheen observed over the shakers. Mud weight at this time averaged 9.6 lbs. Gas averaged 1,000 units and up to 9,000 units on connection while closed to the gas buster. ROP in this section averaged 350’/hr while rotating and lOO’/hr while sliding for direction. <br/>At 12,046’ MD (TVD 9,333’) the upper gamma marker was observed showing a ﬂattening dip of 89.88 degrees. The revised waypoint 3 was set at a ﬂat dip of 90 degrees between 9,332 and 9,342’ TVD from 12,400’ MD and extended to 13,500’ MD. Approaching 13,334’ MD (TVD 9,334’) the Upper gamma marker was observed and yielded a dip of 89.94 degrees. However, samples as well as gamma showed a transformation of the upper gamma marker as a limestone shoal was observed at 13,365’ MD (TVD 9,334’) Samples showed a cream to tan limestone with interbedded sub rounded to rounded dolomites. Gamma dropped drastically from 130 API to an average of 30 API. Gas little to no change averaging 1,000 units. At this time an adjustment in the target window was made dropping the target roughly one foot TVD. As the wellbore descended to a TVD of 9,335’, samples returned to a cream to frosted sub rounded dolomite as gamma rose to average 70 API. <br/>Drilling ahead from 13,400’ MD to 14,188’ MD Gamma averaged 70 API with samples remaining largely unchanged. Gas averaged higher to more than 2,000 units with connection gas averaged 6,000 units or more. Upon reaching 14,188’MD (TVD 9,337’) the upper gamma marker was observed showing a drastic four foot drop in structure. (This is largely due to the shoal previously observed.) The Target window was adjusted four feet down to reﬂect the change in structure at a depth of 14,500’ MD between 9,338’ TVD and 9,348’ TVD. And extended out to 15,200’ MD to between 9,340’ TVD and 9,352’ TVD. <br/>For the remaining 600 feet of the well the upper gamma marker was observed multiple <br/>times reafﬁrming a relatively ﬂat dip. </p>

ROP through the Mission Canyon averaged .59 min/ft. In the upper portion of the Mission Canyon gas averaged 35 units with a peak of 48 units. Samples between 8,100’ MD and 8,200’MD contained moderate amounts of multi-colored slightly calcareous shale including green, red, and purple and orange. Gas through this area averaged only 52 units and drilled at an average of .53min/ft. This area tended to be a transitional area as samples below consisted of a tan to brown carbonaceous, more dolomitic limestone with even yellow ﬂuorescence. Over-all the Mission canyon measured a total thickness of 6 1 8’. </p>

    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Lodgepole formation top was located at 8,516’ TVD as samples transitioned from a brown tan, waxy dolomitic limestone to a light gray to gray argillaceous limestone. An ROP break from .46 min/ft to .33 min/ft was also noted to help conﬁrm. <br/>The upper portion of the Lodgepole consisted of a light to dark gray argillaceous limestone with trace red to black ﬁssile shale observed in samples. Gas averaged 32 units with bump tests performed to insure accuracy. The Upper portion from 8,516’ to 8,800’ averaged .45 <br/>min/ﬂ while rotating. On November 15‘“, 2014 at 1 1:07 PM am a KOP of 8,800’ MD was reached and a trip <br/>out of the hole was made to attach a curve assembly consisting of a 8.75” Hughes DP406 bit and a seven inch Hunting 2.38 bend, 4/510be, 7 stage motor. <br/>Drilling resumed on November 16th, 2014 at 10:52 AM with a target landing of 9,308’ TVD between 80 and 85 degrees. During the construction of the curve, ROP while sliding averaged 2 min/ft. Samples from 8,831’ MD to 9,270’ MD were largely the same consisting of an argillaceous gray dolomite with occasional dark laminations. <br/>Due to slow ROP a trip out of the hole was made on November 16th 2014 at 1:44 PM, returning to bottom at 12:16 AM on November 17111 2014. The Hughes DP 406 from the previous run was re—ran attached to a 6.75” 7/8 lobe, 5 stage, NOV motor. As drilling resumed ROP showed little positive change drilling at 35 to 40 feet per hour. Samples consisted of a gray argillaceous limestone with poor intergranular porosity. While sliding build rates consistently yielded thirteen degrees per one-hundred feet. This allowed for more rotation further down in <br/>the curve portion of the well. Gas continued to show little to no change averaging 28 units. Reaching a depth of9, 194 feet measured depth on November 17, 2014 at 2:50 PM, the decision was made to pull the BHA due to the low ROP. To replace the BHA was a 8.75 inch Hughes T505 bit attached to a 6.75” 5 stage, 7/8 lobe, 2.38 degree motor. On November 17‘h the BHA was returned to bottom and drilling resumed at 10:15 PM. Drilling ahead shale marker 2 was observed at a TVD of 9,212’, roughly four feet low to the prognosis. Shale marker 3 was observed at 9,242’ TVD maintaining thickening of four feet <br/>TVD. Over all the Lodgpole formation totaled a thickness of 757feet.

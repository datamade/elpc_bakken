The False Bakken was identified with samples changing over from a gray dolomitic limestone to a black to dark brown grease non-calcareous shale with blooming yellow green cuts and dull orange brown ﬂuorescence. Gas at this time rose to 70 units from 22 units. Gamma conﬁrmed the False Bakken with a rise in API from 34 to a peak of 107 API. The False Bakken Measured ten feet thick and was exited at 9,562’MD (9,279’ TVD) with an <br/>inclination of 73 degrees. The Scallion was noted at 9,526’ MD (TVD 9,279‘) as samples changed over to a tan <br/>gray to tan dolomitic limestone. Gamma recorded a drop from 109 API to a low of 29 API. While driling the Scallion the observation of a tan gray chert with interbedded quartzite was observed. This made it exceptionally hard to drill dropping the ROP to near ten feet per hour. The Scallion recorded a total thickness of ten feet and was exited at an inclination of 74 degrees. <br/>Upper Bakken 9,599 ’MD 9,289 ’TVD - 7,266 ’SS <br/>Entering the Upper Bakken Shale at 74 degrees at 9,599’ MD with a TVD of 9,289’ Gamma rose to peak of 342 API from 33 API. Gas increased to 200 units. Samples in the Upper Bakken consisted of greasy black non calcareous brittle shale with oil shows consisting of even dull yellow brown ﬂuorescence and instant milky yellow brown cuts. Gas averaged 200 units as the Upper Bakken was penetrated. An exit of the shale was made at 9,721 ’ MD with a TVD of 9,3 16’ at 82 degrees for a wellbore exposure of 134 feet and a total thickness of 27 feet. During the landing the Upper Bakken Shale came in roughly 3 feet low to the prognosis. Due to the large build rates experienced during the upper portion of the curve the lower portion of the well was mostly rotated to ensure the proper build rates needed to land. <br/>Middle Bakken 9, 721 ’MD 9,316 ' TVD -7,293 ’SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was observed a a measured depth of 9,72 1 ’ MD noted with a reverse ROP break from .49 min/ﬂ. to .71 min/ﬂ. samples circulated up and conﬁrmed the Middle Bakken as a gray to cream gray silty dolomite with thin dark laminations were observed. An additional ten feet of measured depth was drilled to place the end of curve roughly one foot into the Middle Bakken. On November 18‘“ 2014, at 4:45 pm, the end of the curve section was reached at a depth of9,731’ MD, 9,316’ TVD. <br/>Casing occurred from the 18‘“ of November to the 19‘“ of November at which time tanks were changed over to salt water and 7” casing was placed in two sections. The ﬁrst was HCP 110 LTC 26# 7” casing set at 5,825’MD, followed by HCP -l 10 LTC 32# 7” casing set at <br/>9,727’. See cement report. Drilling resumed on November 20‘h 2014, at 9:15 AM. Gamma reveled the Middle <br/>Bakken entry to be located at a measured depth of 9,725’ MD at a TVD of 9,3 16’. The Upper gamma marker was observed at a TVD of 9,327’ near a measured depth of 9,8 1 3’. Once the Upper Gamma marker was observed, the initial target window was set at a measured depth of 9,900’ between the TVD’s of 9,323’ and 9,333’ respectively, and extended to 11,000 feet MD between 9326’ and 9,336’ TVD. The Upper Bakken shale located roughly eight feet below dip, suggesting a steep down dip as compared to the offset wells, the target area was kept high in the formation in order to accurately track the Upper Gamma Marker. <br/>The wellbore was kept in the top section of the wellbore just below the Upper Gamma </p>

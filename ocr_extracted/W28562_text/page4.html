    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Lodgepole 9,930’ MD 9,928.45 ’ T VD -7,655. 45’ SS <br/>The top of the Lodgepole was picked at 9,928.45’ TVD, about 1.55 feet high to prognosis. The pick was based off of the gamma marker and sample change, along with differential pressure. Drill rates in the Lodgepole above KOP averaged 1.09 minutes per foot with gas averaging 51 units. Typical samples were gray to dark gray LIMESTONE: Gray to light gray, medium to light brown, creamy brown to tan, ﬁrm slightly to moderately calcareous, no to poor porosity. Cuts and ﬂuorescence shows were sporadic and questionable due to the oil-based mud. <br/>Bakken (Shale) 10,901 ' MD 10, 767’ TVD -s,494’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was encountered at a TVD of 10,786’ which was 4’ high to prognosis. A typical sample was black, gritty, ﬁssile shale with a moderate amount of pyrite occuning as stringers. Gas ranged from 111-276 units through this member. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,959’ .MD 10, 786’ T VD —8,513’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at a TVD of 10,786’ which was 4’ high to prognosis. A typical sample was a ﬁne to very ﬁne-grained, well sorted sandstone, with subangular to subrounded grain textures and calcareous cement. Pyrite was abundant; and present as dark striations and occasional euhedral nodules. Gas ranged from 25-118 units with no visible oil shows to landing of curve. The curve was drilled to 11,065’ MD on September 27, 2014. Casing was set at 11,049’ MD, 10,798.44’ TVD and 495.03’ VS. BHL of casing was 84.76’ FNL & 1,469.37’ FEL in Section 25 T150N R97W. <br/>Lateral 11,049’ — 14, 000’ MD <br/>Casing was exited on October 31, 2014 at 11:05 pm CT. Casing was set approximately 14’ into the Middle Bakken, 2—3’ above the top of the target zone. The planned target was a 13’ window, with a hot marker at the top and a thin cool streak at the bottom. At ﬁrst survey out of casing, it showed that there was signiﬁcantly more angle that had been projected. It appeared that we had most likely seen this jump due to a hard limestone stringer. Corrections were made and the bit was brought to a down trend as the azimuth turn was started. At approximately 11,340’ MD the hot marker was seen and the bit dropped through the limestone stringer and into the target zone. Drilling continued while making the azimuth turn. At approximately 11,900’ MD the turn was completed and drilling went ahead with the bit trending slightly above dip. At 12,180’ MD the hot marker was seen, giving us dip veriﬁcation for this section of the well, which matched what was anticipated based on the previous wells drilled. Corrections were made to bring the bit down but showed less than expected results. At 12,600’ MD it appeared the bit was going to drop but instead showed a hard bounce up and went out the top of target zone at 12,700’ MD. Once above the hard stringer slides produced better results and the bit entered the target zone again at 12,900’ MD, dropping fairly hard as it broke through but leveling oﬁ‘ on its own 5’ below the top. At approximately 13,500’ </p>

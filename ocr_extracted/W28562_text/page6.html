    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The trip at 19,774’ MD showed 4,238 units of trip with no visible oil shows. Circulation was stopped and the gas buster was brought online. Circulation through the gas buster produced no ﬂare and there were very low readings on the chromate gases. Prior to the trip a signiﬁcant amount of sweeps were pumped and it is believed that greatly exaggerated gas readings were produced from the lube sweep material that was circulated out. The second trip at 19,813’ was circulated 100% through the gas buster with returns to the possum belly producing on 220 units with a slight trace of oil. Circulation through the gas buster produced no ﬂare whatsoever. The ﬁnal trip at 19,962’ MD was also circulated 100% through the gas buster with 279 units of gas and no oil shows or ﬂares observed. <br/>This section showed very low, reduced gas readings compared to the previous sections. There were no visible oil shows from the start of this section to TD. Water weights were kept at 9.9 to 10.0 pounds. Although the previous sections did not show a lot of gas there is a noticeable drop through this one as the well bore traversed through the target zone rather than following dip toward the top portion as the previous sections had. Refer to Appendix B to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. </p>

<div style="position: absolute; margin-left: 356px; margin-top: 1594px;">
    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Overall the well had very poor gas and oil shows. The shows that were seen correlated with what appears to be a very thin streak at the top of the target zone just underneath a hard limestone stringer. Samples had scattered to rare ﬂuorescence with rare oil staining and poor to very poor oil cuts throughout the well. The lateral was drilled with 89% of the wellbore in the target zone with the majority of that near the top where what little we saw for shows was seen. From 15,900’ to 16,750’ MD there were indications of a possible fractured zone based on observed drilling parameters. There was also a slight increase in gas through this area. There were no clear indicators while drilling this well to indicate possible production. However, water weights were kept fairly high throughout and there were signs that leave the possibilities open. With drilling maintained in the cleanest part of zone fracking operations should go well and hopeﬁJlly open up something we weren’t able to see while drilling. <br/>The Bailey 5-24H is currently awaiting completion. </p>

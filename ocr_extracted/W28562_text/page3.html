    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Bailey 5-24H is a Middle Bakken well located on Section 25 T150N R97W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The initial phase is a vertical and curve, landing 14 feet into the Middle Bakken. The Bailey 5-24H spudded on September 21, 2014 and reached a total depth of 21,486’ MD on November 10, 2014. <br/>Wellsite geological services began at 8,700 feet in the Charles Formation at 10:00 am CT on September 23‘”, 2014. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected during the straight hole and curve while one hundred foot lagged samples were caught during the lateral. All samples were saved and boxed to be sent to the State of North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 8, 700’ — 11,065’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 8,700 feet in the Charles formation on September 23‘”, 2014 at 10:00 AM CST. Drill rates averaged 1.25 minutes per foot throughout the vertical section, with the gas averaging 41 units, with the highest spikes coming ﬁ'om the upper Bakken shale at 276 units. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Madison (Charles) <br/>The Madison (Charles) was encountered at approximately 8,487’ TVD, which was right on prognosis. The pick was not made as logging had not started. Rop averaged 1.19 minutes per foot. The gas averaged 37 units. Typical samples were clear, blocky salt layered with soft, cream-colored anhydrites and light gray to tan-colored limestones with textures varying from micrites to packstones. <br/>Base of the Last Salt 9,154’ MD 9,152. 54’ T VD -6,879.54’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered at 8,966’ TVD and 6,611’ SS, 12’ high to prognosis but only 2’ higher than the adjacent Budahn H4 well. The Base of the Last Salt was picked by the last sample with salt present, an ROP change, and gamma. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,369’ MD 9,367. 52’ TVD -7,094. 52’ SS <br/>The top of the Mission Canyon was picked at 9,367.52’ TVD, with 0 delta to prognosis. The pick was based oﬁ‘ of the gamma marker and sample change, along with differential pressure. Drill rates in the Mission Canyon averaged 1.12 minutes per foot with gas up to 217 units. Typical samples were gray to dark gray limestone, wackestone, argillaceous, poorly indurated, soft to ﬁrm, no to poor intergranular porosity. Cuts and ﬂuorescence shows were sporadic and questionable due to the oil-based mud. </p>

ROP in the Mission Canyon ranged from 0.30 to 1.80 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas measurements ranging from 10 to 22 units. Samples generally consisted of limestone, which were medium to light and dark gray, medium to light and dark brown, packstone to wackestone, moderately argillaceous, moderately carbonaceous, moderately well indurated, fair intergranular porosity, light to dark green and dark gray ﬂuorescence, with slow to fast streaming cuts. </p>

ROP in the Lodgepole ranged from 0.20 to 6.60 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, with gas measurements ranging from 10 to 1,.363 units. Samples generally consisted of limestone which were medium to dark and light gray, brown to light brown in part, argillaceous, wackestone, silty, slightly carbonaceous, moderately well indurated, fair to good intergranular porosity, light green to dark green/ gray ﬂuorescence, with moderately fast streaming cuts. <br/>Curve Section 8,850’ — 9,689 ’ MD <br/>The curve section of Parshall 26-3029H began 307’ MD into the Lodgepole formation at a KOP of 8,850’ MD. Directional tools were picked up on November 6, 2014, and the curve was started at 1:45 AM CST on November 7, 2014. Drilling rates in the curve ranged from 0.20 to 6.60 minutes per foot while sliding and rotating, and gas measurements ranged from 10 to 1,363 units. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the curve to correlate Parshall 26-3029H with <br/>Parshall 23-3 02 9H. </p>

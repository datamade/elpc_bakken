Sandstone, dolomite, and siltstone stringers interbedded and interlaminated through the upper Three Forks. Background gas averaged 250 to 300 units through the end of the curve. </p>

On the evening of the 16TH of December, 2014, bit number six, a Baker T307 and directional tools were picked up and tripped in the hole. Aﬁer drilling cement and pressure testing casing, the lateral section of the wellbore began drilling ahead shortly before 9:00 PM CST. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Sanish ﬁeld targeting methodology was used for the duration of the lateral wellbore. A 40 foot total targeting window was used, with the top of the window initially set at the top of the Three Forks at 10,316 feet true vertical depth and 10,574 feet measured depth, and projected out at the anticipated over all dip rate of 89.9 degrees. An internal ﬁirther targeting window was set between 15 and 25 feet below the top of the window, with the bottom of the window set 40 feet below the top. The observed dip rate of the lateral was steeper than anticipated, averaging between 89.6 and 89.7, increasing to 89.3 over the ﬁnal 2,000 feet of the lateral. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Lateral drilling began shortly before 9:00 PM CST 0n the 16TH of December, 2014, with drill rates while rotating averaging between 180 and 200 feet per hour, and from 40 to 60 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 175 units. The wellbore descended through the target window, and exited the base following 10,870 feet measured depth. Slides were implemented to increase the inclination in attempt to return to the base of the window. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Samples caught throughout the lateral consisted of shale which was light to medium blue gray, light gray in part, silty, rough, sub blocky to blocky, speckled, and argillaceous. Samples also consisted of sandstone, which was light to medium brown, tan, buﬁ‘, cream tan, very ﬁner to ﬁnely grained, silty, fairly to moderately well sorted, unconsolidated in part, and had good intergranular porosity. Cream to cream gray, oﬁ‘ white, thin, platy, laminated siltstone with dark gray striations also present in some samples. Composition of samples had higher concentrations of shale and siltstone while logged gamma was above 80 API, and higher concentrations of sandstone while below 80, a trend which was noted for the duration of the lateral wellbore. <br/>Through the ﬁrst full day of lateral drilling, the 17m of December, drill rates continued to average between 170 and 200 feet per hour while rotating, and 40 to 60 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 141 units. The wellbore re-entered the base of the target window following 12,600 feet measured depth, but again exited the target window, to the top side, following 13,000 feet measured depth. Observed dip rate was 89.66 degrees. </p>

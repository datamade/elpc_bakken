As our Construction Supervisor began staking potential locations with the survey crew, it was determined that several areas would need to be modiﬁed, due to topographic issues within CCU. Two speciﬁc Drill Spacing Units (DSU) located in the northwest portion of CCU are affected by this limitation, as will be other preliminary locations within the Unit. Please see the attached plat for illustration. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The two referenced DSUs, located in sections 6 and 7, and sections 5 and 8, both located in Tl47N R95W, have extremely rough topography, making accessibility very difﬁcult. It would be exceedingly complicated to build roadways into these areas, lay flowlines or gathering lines, bring in electrical power, or build drilling/producing locations capable of conducting operations. In addition, because they are located immediately adjacent to the Little Missouri River, there are elevated environmental risks. The closest area to develop these sections from would be the southern portion of sections 18 and 17, immediately north of Hwy 22. Although this will require drilling extended laterals to reach the northern extent of these DSUs, and cause development expenses to be increased, we feel this is the only option available to exploit this area of the Unit and prevent stranded acreage within CCU. For reference please see the attached map. <br/>A site review of this area was conducted on May 10. 2012 with Rick Hutchins and Dena Bergstedt from the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC). They both understood the reasons for locating the wells and roads by the highway and concurred with the </p>

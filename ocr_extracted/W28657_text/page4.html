This formation consisted of Limestone: Gray, light gray, cream-gray, brown, light brown, tan, soﬁ to ﬁrm, silty, microcrystalline, argillaceous, slightly dolomitic, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity; even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.73 min/ﬂ and background gas was around 1133 units with a max of 2800 units. The landing target was adjusted to 11,060’ TVD after entering the Middle Bakken. The TD of the curve was reached at 11,362' MD on August 23, 2014 around 7:30 AM., CST. The 7” Inch Casing was set at 11,331’ MD, 11,064.47' TVD, about 21’ feet below the top of the Middle Bakken. The target zone in the Middle Bakken ranged between 12’ and 22’ feet below the Upper Bakken Shale. <br/>Lateral #1 11,362’ 1WD to 20, 994’ MD <br/>The rig started drilling ahead out of casing on August 27th, 2014 around 1:00 PM, CST. A max trip gas of 1459 units was seen. The samples once they drilled out consisted Limestone: Light brown, tan, light gray, ﬁrm, silty, microcrystalline, carbonaceous, slightly dolomitic, fair intercrystalline porosity; even dull yellow/green ﬂuorescence, faint streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was around 0.51 min/ft, and the background gases averaged 518 units with a max of 1717 units. While in the target window the gamma averaged between high 60’s to mid 70’s API. The gamma API near the top of the target window averaged between Low 80’s to Low 90’s API. The top of the target window was encountered at 11,905’ MD, 11058.75’ TVD. The estimated dip to this point was 89.74 degrees. Then the bit went out the top of the formation from 12,582’ MD, 11056.29’ showing an estimated dip of 90.21 degrees. Then re-entered the target window at 12,887’ MD, 11054.85’ TVD, showing an overall dip of 9027 degrees. The samples out the top of the target window consisted of: Limestone: Tan, light brown, tan, light gray, ﬁrm, silty, microcrystalline, carbonaceous, slightly dolomitic, moderate induration, poor to fair intergranular porosity; even dull yellow/green ﬂuorescence, faint thin streaming weak cloudy cut. <br/>From 13,000’ MD to 15,000’ MD, the rate of penetration averaged 0.41 min/ﬂ. The background gases averaged 722 units with a max of 3085 units. Continued to follow an estimated dip of 9027 degrees until 14,200 MD, then the dip was increased to 9055 degrees based on surrounding well information around location, </p>

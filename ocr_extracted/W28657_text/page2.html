The Topeka 7-l2H is a horizontal well targeting the Middle Bakken Porosity, crossing Section 12 and 1. The Topeka 7—12H well was spud on August 4‘“, 2014 and drilling was completed on August 315‘, 2014. Lateral #1 was drilled to a TD of 20,994’ MD. The surface location was set at 250‘ FSL & 2,330' FWL, with Lateral #1 ending coordinates of 251.17‘ FNL & 1,954.68' FWL of Section 1 and 10,060.43‘ N-S & -375.32' E-W from the surface location Joseph Magnan, Dennis Corwin, and Matt McHugh of Neset Consulting Service, provided mudlogging and geological services beginning on August 17th, 2014 in the vertical hole at 9,200’ MD in the Top Charles formation through TD at 20,994’ MD in the Middle Bakken Member. Noram Gas Detection Services were utilized throughout the vertical, curve, and horizontal part of the well. Thirty and One Hundred foot lagged samples were caught, washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core <br/>Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Sample quality was poor to good during the well. Oil and gas shows were poor to fair while in zone. </p>

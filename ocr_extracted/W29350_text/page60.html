An obvious change in the gamma ray response is another easy identiﬁer on the Middle Bakken, quickly decreasing to the mid 40’s to 50 API below the contact. <br/>The curve was landed in the Middle Bakken with an inclination of 88° at 10,496’ <br/>MD and 10,118.16’ TVD on February 8, 2015 at 12:45 pm CST At this point the rig tripped out of the hole to start running casing. The casing shoe was set at 10,482’ MD. <br/>The Lateral 10,496 ’—20,507’ MD <br/>Drilling of the lateral section of the well resumed on February 26, 2015 at 3:00 am CST. Aﬂer drilling out of the shoe the samples consisted of light gray, tan, and very light brown siltstone <br/>The dip of the formation was calculated at an 89.75o overall dip and an azimuth of 179°-181o was held for the entirety of the well. The top of the target window was set at 16 feet below the Upper Bakken Shale, a 3’ set line was placed 3’ below the top of the target window, and the bottom of the window was 7’ below the set line. <br/>Accurate well bore correlation was achieved by using the gamma ray response changes at the 3’ set line and at the bottom of the target window. Gamma ray values between the 3’ set line and the bottom of the window vary a little but stay consistently around the 70’s and 80 API. At the 3’ set line gamma would quickly drop to 50 API before entering the highly variable gamma ray response of the Middle Bakken above the set line. At the bottom of the target window the gamma ray response shorty decrease from 80’s API to mid-60’s API and then climb back into the 80’s. Samples above the target window were light to medium gray to light gray tan siltstone and had poor ﬂuorescence and cut. Within the window samples were light tan, minor amounts of light gray, and very light brown siltstone, these samples had dull ﬂuorescence and weak cut. Samples below the window were similar to samples collected within the window and were light tan to light gray siltstone. <br/>Out of the shoe the well bore road along the top of the window at about the dip of the formation. At about 11,000 MD the well bore took a steep decent through the formation and was ﬂatten out right below the bottom of the window. This allowed for an accurate dip change to be calculate and the formation dip was changed, after encountering the 3’ set line, to 8960 at 11,450’ MD. Samples at the bottom of the window were, SILTSTONE: Light tan, gray, brown, light cream, light tan, light gray, cream tan, sub rounded to sub angular, ﬁne to very ﬁne, moderately sorted, soft, calcareous, slightly dolomitic, argillaceous, poor intergranular porosity, dull yellow ﬂuorescence, very weak cloudy cut, <br/>The well bore continued to ride along the bottom edge of the window for a few hundred feet before coming up through the bottom marker. Formation dip was slightly steeper than previously calculated and was changed to 89.490 at 13,000’ MD. The well bore continue to trend up until it encounter a possible hard streak which deﬂected the well bore back down. The well was steered up at 13,500’ MD and crossed both the 3’ set line and the top of the window, the formation dip was not changed. Above the window gamma signatures are difﬁcult to correlate because they are very variable. Values range from 35 API to 105 API above the window and have no easily identiﬁed pattemi Above the window samples were typically, SILTSTONE: Cream, light to medium gray, light </p>

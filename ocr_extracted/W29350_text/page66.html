The formation dip was raised from 89.490 to 8971". This is formation dip would be followed for the remainder of the well. <br/>At a measured depth of 16,265’ on February 28, 2015 at 2:20 pm CST a MWD tool failure forced a trip, The trip lasted 14 hours and 40 minutes and drilling resumed on March 1, 2015 at 5:00 am CST. Gas values peaked at 831 units due to the trip. When drilling resumed the well bore was right at the 3’ set line and samples were light gray, light tan, to cream siltstone. The samples were slightly dolomitic and ﬂuorescence and cut were weak. <br/>The 3’ set line was crossed one more time at 16,900’ and the formation dip did not change from 8971". The well bore continue to rise through the top of the window and was steered down at 17,200’ MD. <br/>From 17,200’ MD the wellbore continued parallel to formation dip for the remainder of the well. The total depth of 20,507’ MD was reached at 4: 15 am CST on March 3, 2015, <br/>Conclusion <br/>The Bergstrom 11-13H reached its ﬁnal destination at a MD of 20,507’ and TVD of 10179.88’ at 4: 15 am on March 3, 2015, The well is currently awaiting completion. </p>

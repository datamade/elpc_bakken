The Charles was picked using both a change in the gamma ray response and a change in lithologyr At the contact gamma ray values drop from the mid 40’s API to below 20 API and stay relatively consistent over the next 90 feet. Shortly aﬂer this change is encountered the samples change from reddish brown siltstone to transparent salt. Towards the bottom samples change to a light to medium gray limestone with interbedded off white anhydrite and salt. ROP average 94 ﬁ/hr with a signiﬁcant of the formation averaging 196 ﬁlm. Gamma ray response values ranged from 6 API to 79 API, which an average of 20 API. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">At 8,594’ MD the Base of the Last Salt was encounter, at 8,587’ TVD. The Base of the Last salt was picked combination of ROP and gamma ray response. Low gamma ray values and a fast ROP, averaging 12 API and 186 ﬁ/hr in the 40 feet above the contact, are met by slower ROP and high gamma ray values, averaging 30 API and 51 ﬁ/hr in the 40 feet below the contact. There is no evidence of the salt as seen in the Charles. The samples aﬁer the last salt were light to medium gray, dolomitic limestone. White to off white anhydrite is found in some areas in trace and minor amounts. Through <br/>our the entire interval ROP averages 47 feet per hour and the gamma ray response ranges from 2 to 59 API, with an average of 24 API. <br/>Mission Canyon 8,802’ MD 8, 795’ T VD ~6,531 ’ SS <br/>The top of Mission Canyon Formation was reached at 8,802’ MD, corresponding to a true vertical depth of 8,795’, 17 feet higher than the prognosis. The top was chosen by a distinct change in gamma ray response where the values quickly drop from 59 API to 17 API and remain fairly low for the next 25 feet. The average gamma ray response for the formation is 24 API, but this is slightly skewed by the lower 194 feet of the formation that averaged 14.5 API, and the formation had a maximum value of 61 API. ROP varied throughout the section and signiﬁcantly slowed down towards the end. The average ROP was 40 feet per hour. The lithology of the Mission Canyon remained fairly consistent throughout, typically a light gray to light tan, slightly dolomitic, limestone. <br/>Lodgepole 9,432 ’ MD 9,425 ’ TVD - 7,1 61 ’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole was identiﬁed by a slight increase in gamma ray response at 9,43 2’ MD and 9,425’ TVD. Gamma ray increase from roughly 15 API above the contact to 25 API below the contact. Lithology throughout the Lodgepole Formation is similar to the overlying Mission Canyon. Consisting primarily of, LIMESTONE: Light cream, light to medium gray, light tan, cream gray, light to medium gray tan, mottled, packstone to wackestone, soﬁ to ﬁrm, slightly argillaceous, carbonaceous, dolomitic, poor intergranular porosity, scattered dull yellow ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy cut. Gamma ray values averaged 4] API, with a minimum of 13 API and a maximum of 83 API. </p>

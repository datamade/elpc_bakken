    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Forty six feet into the Lodgepole Formation, at 9,478’ MD, a bit failure suspended drilling operations, at 3:30 am CST on February 5, 2015, for 18 hours and 50 minutes. Due to the bit failure drilling rates averaged 24 feet per hour through the Lodgepole, above the KOP and 30 feet per hour below it The curve assembly was picked up and <br/>drilling resumed at 10:20 pm CST on February 5, 2015. The kick off point was reached 82 feet later. <br/>Curve 9,560’ —— 10,496’ MD <br/>The kick off point was reached at a measured depth of 9,560’ on February 6, 2015 at 12:30 am CST. Drilling rates averaged 32 feet per hour throughout the entire curve and on average build rates were 9.4° per 100 feet. Throughout the Lodgepole Formation gamma ray signatures were used to correlate 7 markers, LP1-7, with the offset well Bergstrom 11—13TFH in order to correlate the landing target in the Middle Bakkenr Aﬁer reaching LP] the TVD of the marker was 5’ lower than predicted from the offset, so the target TVD was changed from the original 10,117’ TVD to 10,123’ TVD. This was again changed aﬂer encountering LP6 and was raised 5’ to the ﬁnal target landing depth of 10,118’ TVD. The end of the curve was reached at 10,496’ MD on February 8, 2015, at 12:45 pm CST. The total time for the curve was 60 hours and 15 minutes. The <br/>projected location of the bit was a true vertical depth of 10,118.34’ and an inclination of 88.00°. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The False Bakken came in at a MD of 10,232’ with the TVD of 10,073’ and was picked by a signiﬁcant increase in gamma ray response, the increase is not as great as the Upper Bakken Shale but is easily identiﬁable when compared to the surrounded limestone. The False Bakken came in with a projected target depth of 10,118’ TVD, so no change in target was made. Gamma ray values peaked at 117 API and gas had a maximum of 118 units. <br/>Upper Bakken 1 0,268 ’ MD 1 0, 084 ’ TVD —7, 820’ SS <br/>The Bakken Shale was entered at 10,268’ MD with a TVD of 10,084’. The background gas in the Bakken Shale averaged 648 and ranging from 253 to 1055 units. The top of the Bakken Shale was picked by a drastic increase in gamma ray response, through the unit gamma values averaged 447 API and peaked at 754 API. The change in lithology is also a very good indicator, changing from the typical light gray limestone of the overlying Lodgepole to a very dark gray to black shale. This contact is very sharp. The typical sample in the Upper Bakken is, SHALE: Black, dark gray, ﬁssile, waxy, carbonaceous, gritty, blocky, no ﬂuorescence, no cut. </p>

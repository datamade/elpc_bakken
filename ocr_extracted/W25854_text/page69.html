    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Lateral 11,34 7 —22,400ft <br/>Drilling of the lateral was started after seven inch casing was set at l 1,327ft, and the drilling ﬂuid was changed from oil based to salt water. The casing shoe was drilled outwith a PDC bit and directional tools. Upon drilling out into open formation, the background gas was near 75 units. The curve was landed with an inclination near 88 degrees. While drilling out laterally, the decision was made to slowly decrease in section to get a full pass of the gamma section. While drilling ahead, slides for azimuth were used to turn the well path from 230 to 180 degrees. The ROP was near 120ft/hr While rotating. <br/>While making the turn, several sides for inclination were needed. The inclination increased to as high as 92.71 degrees at a survey depth of 12,555ft. The inclination was then deﬂected downward at a survey depth of 12,618ﬂ. This deﬂection decreased the inclination from 92.49, to 90.49 degrees, and turned the azimuth from 206.54, to 207.09 degrees. The ROP remained near l40ﬁ/hr. The formational dip was near 89.9 degrees. <br/>After ﬁnishing the turn for azimuth, inclination was not holding very steady while rotating. The inclination decreased to as low as 87.97 degrees at a survey depth of 13,780ft, and increased to as high as 92.46 degrees at a survey depth of 14,439ﬂ. The samples increased in sandstone near a measured depth of 14,410ﬁ, then decreased while climbing, at a measured depth of 14,460ft. While drilling ahead, the need came up to stop drilling and repair the draw-works at a measured depth of 14,860ﬂ. After being down for more than two days, drilling resumed. <br/>The formational dip increased to near 90.3 degrees near a measured depth of 14500ft. The inclination was increasing while rotating, this caused the need to slide down often. The ROP was near 150ft/hr while rotating, and the background gas was near 70 units. The inclination started to decrease While rotating, after sliding down at a measured depth of 16,970ft. Several upward slides were needed to level off the inclination. The ROP decreased slightly, to near 140ﬁ/hr. The background gas remained near 70 units. <br/>The ROP decreased, then stopped. The decision was made to trip out of the hole at a measured depth of 17,585ft. The bit, mudmotor, and MWD were changed out. After tripping in the hole and circulating bottoms up, a trip gas of 920 units was recorded. The inclination was decreasing while rotating. While rotating, the well path was deﬂected down at a survey depth of 17,954ft. This decreased the inclination from 91.2 degrees, to 89.7, and decreased the azimuth from 178.71, to 176.77. The background gas increased from near 75 units, to near 200 units. Several upward slides were used to increase the inclination and climb in section. After sliding up at a measured depth of 18,020ft, the inclination increased above 90 degrees. The inclination increased to as high as 92.43 degrees, at a survey depth of 18,306ﬁ. After this, several downward slides were needed to decrease the inclination. The inclination was then building while rotating, causing the need to slide downward often. The background gas decreased from near 300 units, to near 150 units after a measured depth of 19,150ft. The inclination increased from 89.96 degrees at a survey depth of 19,537ft, to 92.06 degrees at the next survey at 19,625ft. After sliding down at a measured depth of 20,222ft, the inclination was decreased to as low as 88.06 degrees at a survey depth of 20,328ft. The inclination then increased to 90.43 degrees on the next survey, at a depth of 20,416ft. Sides were starting to take longer and become less effective. The sample quality decreased due to lube and sweep </p>

While drilling the curve, gamma and sample correlations were used to aid in landing within the Three Forks. The initial target TVD was for landing the curve was 10,996ft. Upon starting the curve, the landing target was lowered by 4’ to 11,000ﬁ TVD. While building the curve, the ROP was near <br/>llOﬁ/hr. </p>

The shale was brownish black, with a slightly silty appearance. It was ﬁrm, slightly calcareous and subblocky to blocky. Occasional micro-pyrite was seen in the samples. The shale had spotty ﬂuorescence and a slow streaming cut. The penetration rate was less than 1 min/ft while in the shale. The background gas increased after ﬁrst getting into the shale to as high as 306 units, then gradually decreased to near 200 units. <br/>Middle Bakken: 11, 024ft MD 10,915ft TVD -8,959ft SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was ﬁrst encountered in samples at a TVD of 10,915ft. The samples were composed of siltstone. It was medium gray to tan in color. It was moderately argillaceous, calcareous to limey in part, and had poor induration. The siltstone had poor porosity, and interbedded dolomite. The dolomite was micro to very ﬁne grained, and limey and sucrosic in part. The samples had spotty dull yellow ﬂuorescence, and fast cloudy cuts. Background gas while drilling in the Middle Bakken Siltstone was near 200 units. </p>

The samples were composed of medium cream gray, to medium tan, siltstone. It had moderate induration, with dolomitic to slightly calcareous cementation. The siltstone was slightly argillaceous, and graded to very fine grained sandstone in part. The samples also had minor blue gray green shale. The shale was slightly calcareous, gritty to smooth in part, and had minor micro pyrite. The samples showed scattered light yellow ﬂuorescence, and moderate cloudy cuts. </p>

Roggenbuck 34-24-2TFH is a 2nd Cycle Three Forks well located in the SWSE of Section 24 T153N R93W in Mountrail County, North Dakota. The initial phase of the Roggenbuck 34-24—2TFH is a vertical and curve, landing ﬁfteen feet into the 2nd Cycle Three Forks. It was then re-entered as a single lateral well in the 2nd Cycle Three Forks. The Roggenbuck 34-24-2TFH spudded March 3, 2015 and reached a total depth of 18,839’ MD on March 31, 2015. <br/>Wellsite geological services began at 8,750 feet in the Charles Formation on March 23, 2015 at 1:30 am CST. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota and at Whiting Oil and Gas Corp. in Denver, Colorado. <br/>Vertical 8, 750 ’ — 1 0,22 7’ MD <br/>Drill rates averaged 1.03 minute per foot throughout the vertical section. Gas averaged 528 units. <br/>Base Last Salt 8, 900’ MD 8, 89 7’ T VD -6, 655 ’ SS </p>

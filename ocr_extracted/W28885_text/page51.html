Zavanna Intends to drill the surface hole with fresh water based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth as per the approved APD. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within 90 days to complete the drilling of the well as per the approved APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is requested in order to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Zavanna understands NDAC 43-0203—31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The cuttings pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Zavanna will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the wellsite if the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig. Zavanna will notify NDIC Inspector with spud date. <br/>Company Telephone Number Zavanna, LLC (303) 595-8004 Address 1200 17th St., Ste 1100 City State Zip Code .11!

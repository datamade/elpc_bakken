Drill rates below the Base of the Last Salt ranged from 0.72—3.32 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 1.24 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 146-286 units averaging 193 units. A typical sample was: LIMESTONE: Gray brown to brown, tan to light tan, light gray tan, gray, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, dolomitic, fair induration, poor to no intergranular porosity, trace interbedded anhydrite, white to cream tan, soﬁ to pasty, trace dead/ dry oil stain, even yellow green ﬂorescence, slow milky cut. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,562’ MD 9,547’ TVD -7,253 ’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was picked 1 foot lower than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and differential pressure. Drill rates in the Mission Canyon formation ranged from 0.03—4.43 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 1.23 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 157—326 units averaging 236 units. A typical sample was: LIMESTONE: Light gray to gray, gray brown, light gray tan to tan, cryptocrystalline to grainstone, argillaceous, dolomitic, fair to good intimation, poor to no intergranular porosity, trace interbedded anhydrite, white to cream tan, soﬁ to pasty , fair dead/dry oil stain, even yellow blue ﬂorescence, weak/fair milky cut. <br/>Lodgepole 10, 086’ 1WD 10, 063 ’ T VD -7, 769 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Lodgepole was encountered at 10,086’ MD, 10,063’ TVD picked 2 feet higher than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and differential pressure. Drill rates in the Lodgepole above KOP of 10,450’ MD ranged from 0.6—4. 12 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 0. 1 .6 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 17 247 units averaging 163 units. Typical samples were: LIMESTONE: Dark gray, gray to light gray, light gray tan, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, fair to good induration, poor to no intergranular porosity, even dull green ﬂorescence, weak milky cut. Curve tools were <br/>picked up once kick off point of 10,450’ MD was reached at 11:45 AM MST on August 8, 2014. <br/>Curve 10,450’ — 11,201’MD <br/>Drilling of the curve began at 6:50 AM MST on August 9, 2014. An initial landing target of 10,881 ’ TVD was set before curve was started. Drilling rates in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged from 0.35—3.12 minutes per foot with an average of 0.79 minutes per foot. Gas in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged from 56-6314 units with average of 332 units. Gamma ranged from 17-88 API with an average of 33 API.

Drilling times in the Lodgepole below KOP were between 1-5 minutes sliding. Gas varied between 11-22 units. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the Lodgepole to correlate to the Arvo 12—33TFH hole. Target stayed at 10,120’ TVD based on Lodgepole correlations. At 9,872'MD on February 13, 2015 1:00pm the decision was made to TOOH for new motor and bit. We got back to bottom at 12:00 am CST on February 14,2015. </p>

Background gas was from 11 to 250 units in the shale A typical sample was Shale: Black, very dark gray, <br/>carbonaceous, calcareous, pyritic, gritty, blocky, even pale yellow ﬂuorescence, instant bright green milky cut. <br/>Mddle Bakken 10, 028 ’ MD 9,994 ’ T VD - 7,82 7’ SS <br/>At 9,994’ TVD the Middle Bakken was encountered. This top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The sample lithology of the Middle Bakken consisted of sandstone. A typical sample exhibited medium to light gray sandstone, light to medium grayish brown, with beige to off-white inclusions, very ﬁne grained, subrounded, calcareous, limey cementation, moderate sorting, poor intergranular porosity, scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, cloudy bright yellow green cut. </p>

Background gas was from 100 to 219 units in the shale A typical sample was Shale: Medium gray, grayish brown, trace dark gray, some mottled, carbonaceous, pyritic, gritty, blocky, even pale yellow green ﬂuorescence, instant bright cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Three Forks 10,220’ MD 10, 098’ TVD -7,931 ’ SS <br/>At 10,098’ TVD the Three Forks was entered. The top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The typical samples consisted of siltstone that was medium grayish brown, light grayish brown, trace off white, arenaceous, argillaceous, dolomitic, with poor induration. Lithology also included trace to moderate shale that was medium bluish gray, waxy, platy, blocky, with moderate induration. Samples exhibited poor intergranular porosity, light brown oil staining, even to scattered dull to pale yellow green ﬂuorescence, with generally instant bright yellow to yellow-green cuts. <br/>We completed drilling curve at 3:00 am CST on February 14, 2015 at 10,358' MD and True Vertical Depth of 10,113.55’. </p>

Upon drilling out of casing the plan was to drill ﬂatter then the formation dip of 90.6 to come down in the target zone in hopes of ﬁnding repeat gamma for correlation purposes. The ﬁrst part of the lateral we made a 28 degree turn. While making the turn we took 30 ﬁ surveys. On February 17, 2015 at 2:30am the decision was made to TOOH for new motor and bit. We got back to bottom and resumed drilling at 10:00pm on February 17, 2015. At 8:30am on February 17, 2015 the formation dip was calculated to a formation dip of 90.55 based upon on correlating gamma. On February 18, 2015 the formation dip was calculated to a formation dip of 90.4 based upon on correlating gamma. On February 19, 2015 we had two formation dip changes the ﬁrst one was at 7:30am with a dip of 90.61. The seconded dip change of the day was changed from 90.61 to 91.15. We made a ﬁnal formation dip change on the well on February 20, 2015 aﬁer two other dip changes on this day. The ﬁnal dip change was changed to 90.6 from 90.74 based upon on correlating gamma. We Reached TD at 2:45pm on February 21, 2015. Total gas was typically between 320 to 1250 units with spikes up to 2088 units. A typical sample exhibited SILTSTONE: Medium brownish gray, light brown, argillaceous, dolomitic, pyritic, highly calcareous, light to medium brown oil staining, thin dark gray laminations, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered dull green ﬂuorescence, slow pale streaming yellow cut. <br/>Conclusion </p>

The initial phase of the Arvo 12-33TFH is a vertical section, with a subsequent curve landing within the ﬁrst bench of the Three Forks Fm. The Arvo 12-33TFH well spud on February 5, 2015 and reached a total depth of 19,445’MD on February 21, 2015. Well site geological services began at 8,350 feet in the Charles Formation. Thirty and ﬁfty foot lagged samples were collected. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota, <br/>Vertical 8,350’ — 9, 652’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 8,350 feet measured depth in The Charles Formation. Gas detection system was recalibrated and tested before logging depth with system ﬁinctioning correctly. Drill rates ranged from 1.0-3.5 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 1 l-17 units. <br/>Base of the Last Salt 8,432 ’ MD 8,422 ’ TVD -6,255 ’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered at 8,432’ MD; -6,255’ SS. Base of the last salt was picked by the last sample with salt present. Samples then became beds of anhydrite, shale and occasional limestone, until the Mission Canyon. </p>

Samples consisted of: Limestone: Gray, light gray, trace mottled, mudstone, dolomitic, trace argillaceous, moderate induration, trace anhydrite, white, cryptocrystalline, tight, mineral ﬂuorescence only, slow pale yellow orange cut. Gas ranged from 11-17 units, <br/>Lodgepole 9, 189 ’ MD 9, 1 79 ’ TVD - 7, 012 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Lodgepole was picked at 9,189 feet measured depth from the gamma marker and sample change. Drill rates in the Lodgepole ranged from 1.5-2.5 minutes per foot rotating with gas ranging from 11—28 units. Typical samples were: Limestone: Light to medium gray brown, medium to dark gray, light grey in part, trace cream, off-white, microcrystalline, fair amounts of blocky chops, platy in part, <br/>moderately hard to soft, no visible porosity, no ﬂuorescence, no cut. KOP was at 9,652’ MD, </p>

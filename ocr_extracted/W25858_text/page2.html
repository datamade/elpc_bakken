    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The well path tracked near formational dip, causing the need for only a few small slides to correct the inclination between large footage intervals. This allowed for more than 3,000” to be drilled within a 24 hour time period. While rotating, the well path was deﬂected downward at a survey depth of 17,391 ’. The inclination decreased from 90.06 degrees at a survey depth of 17,304’, to 86.79 degrees at the next survey depth of 17,391’. The well path was again deﬂected downward at a survey depth of 18,005ft. These deﬂections caused the need to slide up several times, to level off the inclination to near the estimated formational dip of 90.1 degrees. The well path was again deﬂected downward from a hard streak at a survey depth of 19,060’. The inclination was building while rotating, causing the need to slide down several times. The <br/>samples remained siltstone, with interbedded dolomite. Drilling continued to a measured depth of 21,765’. This was called total depth, due to hard line restrictions. Total depth for the lateral was reached at 12:30 am CT, February 14, 2015. <br/>Con clusion </p>

These areas oﬁen slowed ROP rates. The Charles had by far the most diverse lithology out of all the formations in this well. <br/>Base of Last Salt 8,946 ’ MD 8,942 ’ T VD 6, 743 ’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered at 8,942’ TVD; 6, 743’ SS. Base of the last salt was picked by the last sample with salt present, this was accompanied by an increase in ROP. The rig auto driller was set to 150 feet per hour through the salt in order to help ease fall in from the brittle salt. The salt was opaque to oﬁ‘white in color, brittle, subangular, and massive. Samples then became beds of limestone, anhydrite, and occasional shale, until the Mission Canyon. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,148’ MD 9,144 ’ T VD 6, 945’ SS <br/>Mission Canyon was picked from lithology change and the offset log, gamma also cleaned up once we entered the formation. ROP averaged 0.72 minutes a foot. Samples consisted of a mottled limestone, light grey-brown to cream, ﬁrm, micro to very ﬁne crystalline, no visible intercrystalline porosity, abundant anhydrite, trace dark brown to olive green oil stain, scattered to even yellow ﬂuorescence, fast yellow-green milky cut, to a faint blue yellow cut. Gas ranged from 50 to 342 total units in the Mission Canyon. <br/>Lodgepole 9, 760’ MD 9, 756’ TVD 7,55 7’ SS <br/>The top of the Lodgepole was picked at 9,760’ MD using the gamma marker and a slight sample change. Drill rates in the Lodgepole averaged 0.75 minutes per foot rotating. Samples were primarily limestone, light to medium gray brown, medium to dark gray, light grey in part, trace cream, off—white, crypto to microcrystalline, massive to blocky in habit, platy in part, moderately hard to soﬁ, trace to no visible porosity, pinpoint yellow ﬂuorescence, thin streaming cuts. Trace dark brown shale layers were observed in the beginning of the formation. KOP was reached at 10,088’ MD. Oil shows were present in sample towards the bottom of the Lodgepole, however there was no return ﬂow over the shakers. Gas ranged from 79 to 342 total units. <br/>Vertical & Curve 10, 088’ — 10,842’ MD <br/>The ﬁrst sequence of Tarpon Federal 44-19-1RH was to continue drilling our vertical hole to 10,088’ MD, where we tripped out of the hole to pick up our curve assembly. We then began drilling the curve, kicking off at 10,088’ MD. Drilling times in the Lodgepole below KOP averaged 0.82 minutes per foot sliding. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the Lodgepole to correlate to the Tarpon Federal 44-19-2RH. At KOP we kept our target at 10,560’ TVD. We landed the curve at 10,842’ MD, 10,558.42 TVD in 10.4 drilling hours with a Security bit assembly. </p>

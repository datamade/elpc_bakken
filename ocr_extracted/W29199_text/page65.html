The initial phase of the Tarpon Federal 44-19-1RH is a vertical hole, followed by a curve landing in the Middle Bakken formation. The Tarpon Federal 44-19-1RH spud October 25, 2014 and reached a total depth of 20,447’MD on November 10, 2014. Wellsite geological services began at 7,350 feet just above the Tyler formation. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey core library in Grand Forks, North Dakota and at Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation in Denver, Colorado. <br/>Vertical 7,3 75’ — 10,842’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 7,375 feet measured depth in The Tyler Formation. Gas detection system was recalibrated and tested before logging depth with system <br/>ﬁmctioning correctly. Drill rates averaged 0.57 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 11 to 2816 total units. <br/>Tyler 7,446 ’ MD 7,442’ TVD 5,243 ’ SS <br/>The Tyler formation was encountered at 7,446’ MD; 5,243’ SS. The Tyler formation came in very low to prognosis. The gray to brown limestone-siltstone package contained a variety of layers of limestone grading into siltstone with abundant anhydrite stringers and shale beds. The Tyler had a very diverse lithology with the best gas and oil shows coming in at 7,601 ’ TVD where there is a small shale bed in the Tyler sandstone. Gas spiked at 320 total units here. <br/>Kibbey Limestone 8,075 ’ MD 8,071 ’ TVD 5,8 72’ SS <br/>The Kibbey Limestone was encountered at 8,07 5’ MD; 5,872’ SS. The Kibbey Limestone was picked by the change in sample to a lighter brown red limestone with abundant silt content. Samples progressed in oxidation and became a more pronounced rust red brown with interbedded siltstones and trace amounts of shaling. <br/>Charles 8,21 8 ’ MD 8,214 ’ TVD 6, 015 ’ SS <br/>The Charles formation was encountered at 8,218’ MD; 6,015’ SS. The Charles formation came in before logging depth began. The gray limestone package contained a variety of layers of limestone grading into salt beds with abundant anhydrite stringers and beds. The limestone lying underneath the salt and anhydrite beds often contained a fair <br/>3 </p>

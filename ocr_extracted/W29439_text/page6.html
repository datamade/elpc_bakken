    <p class="styleSans791.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Middle Bakken 9, 624’ MD 9, 540’ TVD - 7,14 7’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken Formation was encountered at 9,624’ MD / 9,540’ TVD which was 8’ high as compared to the prognosis depth of -7,155’ SS (sub-sea level) and 5’ low as compared to the Johan Stephen 13-24H. The Middle Bakken Formation was picked by the distinctive sharp drop in Gamma API units that occurs upon leaving the Upper Bakken Shale. The drop in Gamma API unit values near the top of the Middle Bakken Formation was observed to be ﬁom 714.0 to 80.4. In addition, a notable decrease in ROP followed by an increase occurred at the top of the Middle Bakken Formation. ROP rates slowed ﬁom 1.7 minutes per foot to 3.2 minutes per foot and then increased to 1.9 minutes per foot in the vicinity of the Middle Bakken Formation top. The lithology at the top of the Middle Bakken Formation was observed to be a light gray, beige, graytan, light blue-gray, golden brown, and brown-gray, Dolomite with abundant black argillaceous laminations. Gas shows were poor to fair throughout the Middle Bakken Formation with values for total gas ranging from 157 to 582 units of total gas. The overall average gas value for the Middle Bakken Formation was 233 units of total gas. The average rate of penetration through the Middle Bakken Formation was 2.22 minutes per foot. Oils shows were fair with weak hazy to hazy blooming violet-blue cuts being described, while ﬂuorescence was noted to be mostly an even, dull violet-tan, with some noted tan spots. <br/>  <br/>Lower Bakken 9, 742 ’ MD 9,602 ’ TVD - 7,209’ SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale Formation was encountered at 9,742’ MD / 9,602’ TVD which was 6’ high as compared to the prognosis depth of -7, 147’ SS. The Lower Bakken Shale was not encountered on the Johan Stephen 13-24H. The Lower Bakken Shale was picked by the distinctive sharp rise in Gamma API units that occurs upon leaving the Middle Bakken Formation and entering the top of the Lower Bakken Shale. The rise in Gamma API unit values near the top of the Lower Bakken Formation was from 68.6 to 756.6. An increase in the ROP from 3.1 minutes per foot to 1.0 minutes per foot was also noted around the top of the Lower Bakken Shale. The lithology at the top of the Lower Bakken Formation was observed to be a black, waxy, smooth, hard, angular, and carbonaceous Shale. Gas shows were poor to fair throughout the Lower Bakken Shale as well, with values for total gas ranging from 193 to 800 total gas units with an overall average of 528 units of total gas. The average rate of penetration through the Lower Bakken Shale was 1.33 minutes per foot. Oil shows were strong with typical bright blooming milky blue-white cuts being observed. Fluorescence was noted to be an even dark violet color. <br/>Three Forks 9, 826’ MD 9, 634’ TVD -7,241 ’ SS <br/>The Three Forks Formation was encountered at 9,826’ MD / 9,634’ TVD which was 1’ high as compared to the prognosis depth of -7,242’ SS. (My personal thoughts on the pick are: MD: 9,820’, TVD: 9,632’ as this is where the Gamma drops below 200 API units). The Three Forks Formation was picked by the distinctive sharp drop in Gamma API units that occurs upon leaving the Lower Bakken Shale. The drop in Gamma API unit values near the top of the Three Forks Formation was from 814.2 to 98.6. In addition ROP also showed a sharp drop and then rise at the top of the Three Forks Formation. The ROP values surrounding the formation top dropped from 1.5 minutes per foot to 1.6 minutes per foot and then increased back to 1.3 minutes per foot </p>

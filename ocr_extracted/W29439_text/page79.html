CST on Monday, November 10, 2014. The Logged Vertical Leg was completed in seventy-nine hours and no minutes (79:50) which included the twenty-ﬁve hour and thirty-one minute (25:31) trip for curve tools. <br/>Kibbey Lime 7,345 ’ MD 7,344 ’ TVD -4,951 ’ SS <br/>The Kibbey Lime was encountered at 7,345’ MD / 7,344’ TVD which was 1’ low as compared to the prognosis and 2’ higher than the Johan Stephen 13-24H. The Kibbey Lime was picked off of a drop in rate of penetration (ROP) ﬁ'om 1.5 minutes per foot to 1.7 minutes per foot at the formation top. The lithology at the transition exhibited a change from a sample that was described as being 98% cream, tan, beige, off-white, white, light tan, soft, gummy, and pasty Anhydrite with 2% reddish-brown, red, dark red, light red, orange—brown, and orange-red, Limy Siltstone to one that was described as being composed of 98% brown, dark brown, dark gray, gray, blue-gray, reddish orange, carbonaceous, argillaceous, Dolomitic Limestone with 2% offwhite, white, tan, cream, and beige, soft, gummy, and pasty Anhydrite. The Kibbey Lime had gas shows that were determined to be poor averaging only 80 units, with a high value of only 84 units of total gas. Average penetration rates, through the Kibbey Lime, were observed to be 1.29 <br/>minutes per foot. </p>

The lithology at the transition exhibited little change ﬁ'om a sample that was described as being 100% reddish brown, tan, cream, red, violet-brown, dark red, brown, right brown, and light gray, Dolomitic Limestone to a sample that was observed to be 100% reddish brown, tan, light brown, cream, beige, and orange-brown, Dolomitic Limestone. The interval between the Madison and the Charles Salt exhibited gas shows that were poor with average values of total gas being noted as 77 units with a high value of only 81 units. Average penetration rates to the Charles salt were observed to be 1.10 minutes per foot. </p>

The lithology at the top of the Charles Salt saw a transition from a sample that was observed to be 100% Limestone to a sample that was described as being comprised of 60% Salt with 25% Limestone, and 15% Dolomitic Siltstone.

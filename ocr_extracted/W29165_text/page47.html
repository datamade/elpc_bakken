    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">penetration rates were held to under 100 ft/hr while rotating. Frequent slides were done to build the directional turn needed to begin heading to the north. While beginning the lateral one foot above the <br/>center of the geologic zone of interest, targets were set to reﬂect a 90.0 degree dip rate. <br/>While drilling ahead past [2000‘ MD to 13,000‘ MD, wellbore inclination had decreased enough for wellbore to move down in formation and into Basal Clean gamma at the bottom of the geologic zone of interest. At approximately 12315” MD we moved above the center of the drilling target window. At about the same depth we moved above the center of the geologic zone of interest. At approximately 12,920’ MD or 2,000‘ VS, targets were changed to reﬂect the up dip information. Rate of penetration was from 50 to 310’ per hour. Gamma was from 65 to 135 API Units. Gas was from 35 to 800 units with increases at connections. A typical sample was DOLOMITE: Light brown, light blue gray, light tan, light gray, blue gray, medium gray, off white, microcrystalline, sub—rounded, argillaceous, trace pyrite, imbedded pyrite, moderate induration, ﬁrm, poor intercrystalline porosity, scattered blue ﬂuorescence, <br/>slow diffuse cloudy cut. Continuing to drill ahead from 13,000’ MD to 14,000’ MD, the Basal Clean marker was <br/>contacted approximately 2.0- 2.2’ above the bottom of target window indicating the target was well placed. The well bore remained mostly in the bottom of the target window. At approximately 13922’ MD or 3,000’ VS the targets were raised 1 foot TVD and the inclination was raised from 90.0 degrees to 90.3 degrees. This adjustment was done to reﬂect the formation rising. Penetration rates were from 75 to 350 feet per hour. Gamma was from 65 to 120 API units. Gas was between 30 to 300 units with increases at connections. Samples typically were; DOLOMITE: Light blue gray, light brown, light gray, medium gray, light tan, cream gray, cream, white, off white, microcrystalline, sub-rounded, argillaceous, calcareous, trace pyrite, imbedded pyrite, moderate induration, ﬁrm, poor intercrystalline porosity, blue green ﬂuorescence, slow weak yellow cloudy cut. <br/>While drilling past 14,000’ MD to 15,000, wellbore maintained its position under the center of the target window. Correlations were suggesting wellbore was drilled above and below the center of the geologic zone of interest. This gave us a good conﬁdence in the correlations. Samples confirmed latest interpretation, typically showing a light brown to light gray brown dolomite. At approximately 14,924’ MD and 4,000” VS targets were lowered 5’ and inclination remained at 90.3. This adjustment was because the formation remained ﬂatter for longer than anticipated. The use of Enviro-Torq used to minimize torque and anti-foam agents, altered any potential oil shows. Penetration rates continued to average 150 — 300 ft/hr. Gamma was between 75 to 125 API units. With total gas averaging 200 — 500 units with increases at connections. A typical sample was; DOLOMITE: Gray brown, light brown, light blue gray, light gray, gray, cream gray, off white, microcrystalline, sub-rounded, argillaceous, calcareous, imbedded pyrite, moderate induration, ﬁrm, poor intercrystalline porosity, dull even, blue yellow <br/>ﬂuorescence, weak yellow blue cut. After drilling past 15,000’ MD to 16,000’ MD the wellbore was drilled in predominantly the <br/>upper half of the drilling target window. At this interval dip rates started increasing from 90.2 to 90.7 degrees. Rates of penetration remained from 175 to 325 feet per hour. Gamma was from 75 to 125 AP] Units. Gas was in the range of 150 to 350 units. Samples were typical1y; DOLOMITE: Light brown, light tan, light tan brown, light blue gray, light gray, cream tan, off white, microcrystalline, platy, sub-rounded, argillaceous, trace pyrite, imbedded pyrite, moderate induration, friable, poor intercrystalline porosity, scattered blue yellow ﬂuorescence, slow thin cloudy white cut. <br/>Drilling further ahead from 16,000’ MD to 17,000’ MD the target was changed at 16,427’ MD or 5,500 VS. This change raised the targets 4’ TVD and raised inclination to 90.4 degrees. At approximately 16,927‘ MD, or 6,000” VS targets were lowered 4‘ TVD, and inclination remained at 90.4 degrees. This last target change was made so we could contact the basal clean gamma. Penetration rates were from 150 to 300 feet per hour. Gamma was from 60 to 125 API units. Gas was from 250 units to 500 units with increases at connections. Samples typically consisted of; DOLOMITE: Light blue gray, light brown, light tan, light gray, cream gray, cream, microcrystalline, sub-rounded, platy, argillaceous, slightly calcareous, imbedded pyrite, moderate induration, ﬁrm, poor intercrystalline porosity, dull blue white ﬂuorescence, slow even blue white cloudy cut. </p>

    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling from 17,000‘ MD to 18,000’ MD the well bore was drilled predominantly in the lower part of the drilling target window. At approximately 17,928’ MD, or 7000’ VS, targets were raised 5’ and inclination was changed from 90.4 degrees to 90.6 degrees. Rates of penetration were from 125 to 250 feet per hour. Gamma was from 41 to 176. The hot gamma was from the structure below the basal clean gamma. Gas was from 225 units to 450 units with large increases, over 11,000 units for connections. Samples consisted of; DOLOMITE: Light tan, light blue gray, light brown tan, light gray, gray, cream gray, cream, off white, microcrystalline, sucrosic, platy, argillaceous, imbedded pyrite, moderate induration, ﬁrm, poor intercrystalline porosity, dull even blue white ﬂuorescence, weak streaming yellow cut. The use of Enviro-Torq used to minimize torque and anti—foam agents, altered any potential oil <br/>shows. Drilling past 18,000' MD to 19,000” MD the wellbore was drilled from the lower part of the <br/>drilling window to the upper part of the drilling window. The target was raised 2’ and the inclination was lowered from 90.6 degrees to 90.4, this change was at approximately 18,931 ’ MD, or 8,000’ VS. Torque increased and so did the use Enviro—Torq, this altered potential oil shows. Rates of penetration were from 125 to 225 feet per hour. Gamma was from 47 to 145 API units. Gas was from 125 to 400 units with increases at connections. The typical sample was; DOLOMITE: Light blue gray, light brown, light tan, light gray, cream gray, cream, microcrystalline, sub-rounded, platy, argillaceous, calcareous, imbedded pyrite, moderate induration, ﬁrm, poor intercrystalline porosity, dull blue white ﬂuorescence, slow even blue white cloudy cut. <br/>Over the next 1,000’ from 19,000” MD to 20,000‘ wellbore remained predominantly in the upper half of the target window and appeared to be following dip of formation. Correlations continued to show a consistent up — dip, but were not real strong as several different interpretations were plausible resulting in uncertainty of wellbore’s position in zone. The target was lowered 4’ TVD and inclination changed to 90.2 degrees. This change in targets took place at approximately 19,932” MD, or 9,000‘ VS. Samples were of little help as there was little to no change in the overall consistency of the samples. Penetration rates continued to average 75 ~ 140 ft/hr. Gamma was from 65 to 125 API units. Total gas was from 190 — 400 units with increases at connections. Typically samples consisted of; DOLOMITE: Light blue gray, light brown, light gray, gray, light tan, cream gray, off white, microcrystalline, sub—rounded, platy, argillaceous, trace pyrite, imbedded pyrite, moderate induration, ﬁrm, poor intercrystalline porosity, dull blue yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming cloudy white cut. <br/>Continuing to drill past 20,000” MD to 20679 wellbore continued to act as if it were high in zone, but correlations were still poor. Wellbore eventually bounced off a hard steak in formation causing well to quickly move up in formation before dropping back down. This generated a good correlation and conﬁrmed well was higher in formation than originally thought. This also suggested that formation dip was toe down in the ﬁnal few hundred feet. At approximately 20,434 target inclination was changed from 90.2 to 90.0 degrees and the target was lowered 4’ TVD, in hopes of being able to move down in formation and follow fomiation dip. Rate of penetration was from 115 to 225 feet per hour. Gamma was from 65 to 1 15 API units. Gas was from 150 to 300 units with increases at connections. The typical sample was; DOLOMITE: Light blue gray, light gray, gray, light brown, cream gray, off white, white, cream, microcrystalline, sub-rounded, platy, argillaceous, calcareous, imbedded pyrite, trace pyrite, moderate induration, ﬁrm, poor intercrystalline porosity, blue yellow ﬂuorescence, weak yellow cut. <br/>TD of the Three Forks lateral was reached at 20,679’ MD on February 25, 2015 at 9:10 pm CST. A projection to bit showed wellbore ﬁnished 65’ below center of the geologic zone of interest. </p>

As the structure map indicated and past wells in the area had shown, the formation dip was expected to remain relatively ﬂat at the beginning and end of the lateral with the middle portion being toe up at 90.4 to 90.7 degrees. Overall average dip was expected to be 90.28 degrees for the entire lateral. Over the next few thousand feet well formation dip changed from toe-down to toe-up making targeting extremely </p>

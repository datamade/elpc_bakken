This was 9‘ higher than expected, but no changes to landing target were made. Kick off point was reached at 10,831 ‘ MD and a ﬂip out of the hole was made to pick up curve assembly. <br/>Beginning the build portion, drill rates averaged 30 — 60 ft/hr while sliding 80 — 100 %. Samples continued to show gray argillaceous dolomitic limestone. Gamma markers in the upper portion of the fomiation continued suggesting target formation would come in slightly lower than anticipated. Continuing to drill ahead, gamma correlations through the middle and lower portions of the Lodgepole showed the distance between markers had started to thin, suggesting a shallower ideal landing target. Landing target was raised 4’ TVD as a result. Drilling ahead, noticeable thinning continued resulting in <br/>the need to raise landing target another 4‘ TVD. <br/>Upper Bakken 11,368 ’ MD I 1,25 7’ TVD -8,821 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Upper Bakken was reached at approximately 1 1,368’ MD / 11,257’ TVD, 10‘ higher than originally predicted on the prognosis. The formation top was ﬁrst estimated in real time with drill rate then reﬁned by the gamma. Samples transitioned to black carbonaceous shale with total gas increasing to average 200 — 300 units and over at connections. After reaching the base of the shale the <br/>total thickness was estimated to be 18’, 1’ thinner than originally anticipated. </p>

This suggested an ideal Three Forks landing target of 1 1,364‘ TVD, 3’ higher than landing target. Samples transitioned to gray argillaceous siltstone with drill rates between 20 — 40 ft/hr, total gas averaged 90 i 150 units. After reaching the base of the Middle Bakken, total thickness was estimated to be 45‘, l‘ thicker than originally estimated on the geological prognosis. <br/>Lower Bakken 11,513’MD 11,320' TVD -8,884’ SS <br/>At 1 1,513' MD weight on bit decreased as rates of penetration increased, garmna began rising above 150 API to conﬁrm the top of the Lower Bakken, 10’ higher than original anticipated top. This suggested a Three Forks landing target of 11,366’ TVD, conﬁrming current landing target was accurate. Samples transitioned to black to dark gray shale with drill rates between 30 — 50 ft/hr, with total gas between 150 — 200 units. After reaching the base of the Lower Bakken, the total thickness was estimated to be 28’, 3’ thicker than original estimate. <br/>Three Forks 11,607’MD 11,348’ TVD -8,912’SS <br/>At 11,607' MD weight on bit increased as rates of penetration decreased, gamma began falling below 150 API to conﬁrm the top of the Three Forks at 7’ higher than the original estimated top. This suggested a Three Forks landing target of 1 1,368‘ TVD, which was 1’ lower than current target. Samples transitioned to dolomite, light gray to dark gray with light blue. Drill rates decreased to between 20 — 40 ft/hr, with total gas between 90 — 140 units. Continuing to drop in structure gamma gradually heated back to 90 — 1 10 API where it ﬂuctuated slightly as the curve was landed. Drilling in curve portion of well was ﬁnished at 11,794' MD on December 11, 2014 at 6:35 am CST. <br/>North Three Forks lateral I I, 794’ - 20,679 ’ MD <br/>After setting intermediate casing, picking up directional tools, drill pipe, and drilling cement, drilling new formation was resumed on February 19, 2015 at 8:06 pm CST.

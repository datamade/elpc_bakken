    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">EOG is implementing a radioactive tracer program on several upcoming Bakken producers. The programs' purpose is to better identify fractures in the Middle Bakken production interval. Approximately 2mg of Scandium-46 (1-milliCuire) tracer beads are introduced with the cement spacer ahead of the production hole cement. The spacer with the tracer leaks off into fractures ahead of the cement. A post well gamma-ray log will then be run to read different gamma in the fractures compared to the original MWD formation gamma. </p>

Tracer company (ProTechnics) 0 Provide 72 hr notice to ND Dept. of Health prior to job. I (Adds the NDIC ﬁeld Inspector to this notice) 0 Provides 2mg of Scandium ~46 Tracer in the form of sealed proppant beads. 0 Provides pre-job containment of tracer and conducts pre-job site surveys. o Supervises the insertion of tracer into production hole cement spacer. 3. Disposal company (Secure Energy Services) 0 Obtains necessary permits for disposal at approved disposal facility. 0 Provides post job handling of tracer, ﬁnal monitoring/survey of wellsite and tracer disposal. 4. Cementing Company (Sanjel Cementing) 0 Provides inlet into low pressure side of cement purnp for injection of tracer. <br/>The steps below describe the implementation, monitoring, containment and disposal of the radioactive tracer: </p>

    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">9) <br/>Dewatering boxes used for temporary storage and containment of residual tracer will be delivered and <br/>set up prior to start of cement job. <br/>ProTechnics personnel conducts pre-job monitoring of well-site and equipment in close proximity to planned tracer operations to establish and document a measured baseline. <br/>Pre-job safety/informational meeting conducted by Protechnics with all parties involved on rig. <br/>The proppant tracer will be injected into the low pressure side of the cement pump. The tracer is pumped with the cement spacer ahead of the cement. <br/>Post job surveys are completed in the injection area and all downstream lines from the injection point. During the cement job, spacer returns are diverted to dewatering boxes where the tracer material is <br/>allowed to separate from spacer fluid. SECURE personnel will come to the well site after the cementing process is complete and conduct wellsite surveys including the dewatering boxes, and any other containers used to handle the cement <br/>returns. Cement spacer (in the false bottom of the dewatering box) will be surveyed and documented. The <br/>water will either be removed by vac truck or moved, transferred or mixed as directed by the client based <br/>on the onsite survey. SECURE will be responsible for all loading and materials handling by state-certified radioactive materials <br/>technicians. <br/>10) The tracer-impacted waste stream will be transported for final disposal at an approved and licensed <br/>radioactive waste disposal facility. A copy of the final manifest and certificate of disposal will be provided to the client after project completion. </p>

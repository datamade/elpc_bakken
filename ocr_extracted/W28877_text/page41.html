    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">At 16,900’ measured depth the wellbore went out the base of the target window. The Aquitard was encountered again at 17,735’ measured depth. The dip was estimated to be 90 degrees between 16,786’ to 17,640’ measured depth. Sliding succeeded in bringing the wellbore higher in true vertical depth in order to get out of the dirty gamma present in the Aquitard. At 17,997 ’ the wellbore came out of the Aquitard and the clean gamma was encountered The clean gamma marker was used to estimate the dip to be 89.2 degrees between 18,000’ to 18,500’. In this interval the rate of penetration ranged from 0.38 to 3.33 minutes per foot and averaged 0.71 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 241 to 2009 units and averaged 654 units. Gamma ranged from 40 to 109 API and averaged 62 API. <br/>The wellbore continued to rise in true vertical depth and crossed the set line at 18,465’ measured depth. Drilling continued in the dirty gamma in top 6’ of the target window. Samples in the top of the target were generally described as a light tan to cream sandstone with small amounts of shale and siltstone. The porosity was fair. Gamma ranged from 68 to 119 API and averaged 92 API. Total gas ranged ﬁ'om 28 to 920 units and averaged 593 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.27 to 3.73 minutes per foot and averaged 0.59 minutes per foot. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">A trip was made at 18,706’ measured depth due to slow ROP. A new bit and motor were picked up. Once back on bottom, trip gas spiked to 836 units with a 15’ gas ﬂare. The ﬂare was maintained for two hours while circulating the gas out of the wellbore. At 18,910’ measured depth the wellbore crossed the set line and the clean gamma encountered. This was an indicator that the dip was slightly ﬂatter. The dip was estimated to be 89.54 between 18,500’ and 19,000’. Another trip was made at 19,755’measured depth due to MWD tool failure. Once back on bottom trip gas spiked 1285 with a 20’ ﬂare. The 20’ gas ﬂare was maintained for an hour after the initial spike. <br/>At about 19,000’ measured depth, the wellbore went out the base of the target window. The wellbore remained a few feet under the base of the window until 20,800’. Gamma ranged from 39 to 113 API and averaged 66 API. Total gas ranged from 180 to 2307 units and averaged 572 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.28 to 3.43 minutes per foot and averaged 0.48 minutes per foot. Samples under the target window were generally described as a light gray, cream sandstone with small amounts of shale and siltstone. The porosity varied from poor to fair. </p>

Sliding succeeded in bringing the wellbore higher in true vertical depth, until reaching the clean gamma at about 20,700’. </p>

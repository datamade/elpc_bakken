The ﬁrst sample caught in the Middle Bakken was described as cream tan sandstone with poor to fair porosity. Samples quickly transitioned to cream colored dolomite with fair porosity and a weak streaming cut The ﬁnal sample caught before the shale was majority brown gray sandstone with poor porosity and a fair streaming cut. Rate of penetration in the Middle Bakken ranged from 0.47 to 1.93 minutes per foot, averaging 0.66 minutes per foot Total gas ranged from 163 to 690 units, averaging 301 units. Gamma ranged from 38 to 131 API, averaging 96 API.

Rate of penetration in the Three Forks while drilling the curve ranged ﬁom 0.23 to 1.20 minutes per foot and averaged 0.75 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 354to 617 units and averaged 485 units. Gamma ranged from 54 to 146 AP] and averaged 86 API. Initially samples were light gray to brown gray sandstone with overall poor porosity. Samples had a good yellow green cut.

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">After drilling out intermediate casing the wellbore was allowed to drop in true vertical depth in order to enter the target window. Aﬂer the wellbore encountered the base of the target window, sliding brought the inclination closer to 90 degrees to level off in the target window. At this time the azimuth tum was still being made, requiring a higher than average slide to rotate ratio. Once an azimuth of 180 was achieved, the wellbore was a few feet under the base of the target window. The samples below the window were described as sandstone: light brown, light gray, cream, tan, ﬁne grain, subangular to subrounded, dolomitic cement, moderately to poorly sorted; 20% shale, light blue green, platy, ﬁssile, 15% siltstone, thin dark laminations, platy; fair porosity, faint even dull white ﬂuorescence, pale blue cut. <br/>The wellbore dropped in true vertical depth and bounced oﬁ‘ the Aquitard at 12,400’. A dip rate of 90 degrees was estimated using the Aquitard encounter. Sliding brought the wellbore higher in true vertical depth, and the set line was crossed at 13,382’. The wellbore remained in the top of the target window until 15,445’ measured depth. In the interval from 13,382’ to 15,445’ the rate of penetration ranged from 0.18 to 4.00 minutes per foot and averaged 0.39 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 196 to 2503 units with an average of 725 units. Gamma ranged ﬁom 45 to 129 API and averaged 93 API. Samples from the dirtier gamma at the top target window were generally sandstone: tan, light brown, translucent, off white, cream, very ﬁne grain, subangular, moderately sorted, poorly cemented, dolomitic cement, trace pyrite; 20% shale, light blue green, ﬁssile, platy, 25% siltstone, light gray blue, thin dark laminations, platy; fair to poor porosity, even dull green ﬂuorescence, pale white blue cut with faint streamers. <br/>At 15,445’ measured depth the 3’ set line was crossed and the clean gamma was encountered. The wellbore continued to drill within the bottom 3’ of the target window. The samples in the clean gamma were generally described as sandstone: cream tan, tan, cream, translucent, very ﬁne, subangular to subrounded, moderately to poorly sorted, poorly cemented, dolomitic cement; 5% siltstone, light gray, laminated, platy, 10% shale, light green, light gray, pyritic, ﬁssile; rare pyrite; fair porosity; scattered dull green ﬂuorescence, milky green fair streaming cut. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The set line was crossed again and the dirty gamma was seen at 15,761 ’ measured depth. The clean gamma marker was used to estimate the dip to be 8956 degrees. Drilling continued in the dirty gamma for about 235’. At 16,000’ measured depth the wellbore cut down across the set line and continued in the clean gamma for 168’. At 16,168’ measured depth, the dirtier gamma was encountered and drilling remained in the top 6’ of the target window. At 16,782’ the wellbore encountered the clean gamma which was an indicator of the set line being crossed. In the interval from 16,168 to 16,782 total gas ranged ﬁom 224 to 1976 units and averaged 639 units. The rate of penetration ranged ﬁom 0.23 to 3.8 minutes per foot and averaged 0.55 minutes per foot. Gamma ranged from 55 to 121 API and averaged 95 API. </p>

    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-192 states in part that all waste material associated with exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. <br/>Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. <br/>Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an authorized facility. Such containers must be: <br/>0 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container <br/>0 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container <br/>0 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container <br/>If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. <br/>As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud, invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash. <br/>Thank you for your cooperation. </p>

Typical samples were a limestone consisting of a medium gray to light gray tan, cream gray in part, dark gray, dark tan in part, packstone to wackestone, microcrystalline, ﬁrm to hard, very calcareous, slightly argillaceous, poor intergranular porosity, dull greenish brown with spotted <br/>yellowish ﬂuorescence, with a slow very faint thin cut. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Curve began on October 18th, 2014. KOP was at 10,672’ MD and 10,664’ TVD. This depth is 394 feet TVD into the Lodgepole formation. Drilling times ranged from 0.1 to 4.1 min/ft and averaged 0.9 min/ft. Gas averaged 176 units with values as high as 2,570 units. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the curve to correlate with the Wisness 150-100-23-14-6H well. <br/>Upper Bakken 11,137'MD 11,076' TVD -8, 757' SS <br/>The top of the Upper Bakken was picked at 11,076’ TVD; -8,757’ SS from the samples changing ﬁom a gray to medium gray limestone to a black to dark brown shale. Shale sample was black to dark brown, very carbonaceous, slightly silty, and blocky. Sample had a very dark brown ﬂuorescence and an instant blooming milky cut. It was also picked by a drop in differential pressure and correlating gamma markings. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,162'MD 11,093 ’ T VD -8, 774 'SS <br/>At 11,093’ TVD the Middle Bakken was encountered. This top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The Middle Bakken exhibited a Dolomite that was a light tan gray to dark beige, light gray, tan to off white in part, silty in part, microcrystalline, sub-rounded to sub-angular, carbonaceous, argillaceous, calcareous, moderate induration, good to fair intercrystalline porosity, dull green to yellow ﬂuorescence, with a fast streaming bright cut. <br/>Lower Bakken 11,220' MD 11,122’ TVD -8,803 'SS <br/>At 11,122’ TVD the Middle Bakken was encountered. This top was picked from lithology, gamma, and ROP changes. The Lower Bakken exhibited a Shale that was black, dark gray, dark brown, blocky, soﬁ to ﬁrm, trace dolomite, brown to gray, silty, slightly sucrosic, very carbonaceous, waxy, platy, very dark brown with scattered bright yellow white ﬂuorescence, with a fast bright cloudy cut. </p>

This formation was picked from lithology, gamma, and ROP changes. The Three Forks produced a Dolostone/Limestone/ Sandstone that was Greenish gray, cream tan, dark gray laminations, anhydritic with interbedding anhydrite, blocky, friable, argillaceous, slightly calcareous, slightly carbonaceous, dolomitic, chalky to fair induration, chalky to fair intercrystalline porosity, yellow green to blue green ﬂuorescence, with a slow milky cut. <br/>Horizontal 11,407’ — 21,200’ MD </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Horizontal section was started using brine water, in the Three Forks <br/>Formation at 10:35 AM CDT on October 2lst, 2014. Drilling times ranged from 0.1 to 11 min/ﬂ. Gas averaged 95 units with values as high as 365 units. Gamma was monitored and correlated to calculate formation dips throughout the Lateral. <br/>The ﬁrst section of the Lateral experienced a formation dip of 89.8 to 89.76 degrees. The well bore was drilled just on top of the “E” marker for approximately 1,000’ MD. In this section we were able to come down in zone and see gamma from our entire drilling window TVD. This aided in geo-steering the remainder of the Lateral. <br/>In the second section of the Lateral, a large cool api gamma count was utilized to geo-steer oﬁ‘ of. This marker was illustrated on the Well Tracker as the “Top Window” marker. The well bore tracked very well ﬁ'om 13,500’ to 18,000’ MD along this marker. <br/>Local formation dip was calculated averaging 89.6 degrees. <br/>The ﬁnal section of the Three Forks Lateral, the formation dip steepened to an 89.46 degree dip. In this section, the well bore stayed above the “Top Window” marker for the remainder of the well. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Wisness 150-100-23-14-11TFH well reached a total measured depth of 21,200 feet. The curve was executed 1’ TVD within the planned target. Throughout the entire Lateral, gas averaged 95 units with values as high as 365 units. The wellbore was in the planned target zone for the majority of the well and the Geo-steering Plan was carried out according to local calculated dip angles. The casing point was landed 85’ TVD into the Three Forks Formation. The Lateral was drilled mainly 15-25’ TVD into the Three Forks formation. The Wisness 150—100-23-14-11TFH well was drilled in 17 days. <br/>Jesse F reborg Wellsite Geologist </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Pad .1 is a located in the SE/4 of Section 34, Tl47N—R94W. The pad includes the CCU Bison Point 44-34MBH and CCU Bison Point 44-34TFH; these wells have been drilled. <br/>Pad K is a new dual-well pad proposed in the SW/4 of Section 20, T147N-R95W. The pad includes the CCU William l4-201VIBH and CCU William l4-20TFH wells. These wells were <br/>drilled in 2013. <br/>Pad L was initially a quad-well pad located in the NE/4 of Section 29, T147N—R95W. This pad was moved slightly to the southwest to minimize surface disturbance and includes additional TF wells. Pad L includes the CCU William 44-20TFH, CCU William 34-20MBH, CCU Powell 41- <br/>29TFH, and CCU POWell 31-29MBH wells. These wells were drilled in 2013. <br/>Pad N was initially a dual-well pad located in the WM of Section 28, Tl47N-R95W. This pad <br/>was converted to a quad-well pad to accommodate TF wells and it will include the CCU Four Aces 24-21TFH, CCU Four Aces 24-21MBH, CCU Corral Creek ll-28MBH, and CCU Corral Creek 21-28TFH; these wells were drilled late 2013 and early 2014. <br/>Pad 0 is a quad pad located in the SE/4 of Section 21, Tl47N-R95W. This pad will include CCU Four Aces 34-21TFH, CCU Four Aces 34—21MBH, CCU Corral Creek 31-28TFH, and CCU Corral Creek 31-28MBH. These wells were drilled in early 2014. <br/>Pad P was planned and permitted before the inception of the unit as a single well pad located in SW/4 of Section 24, T147N-R95W. The location of the well will remain the same, but the well name will change from the Main Streeter l4-20H to the CCU Main Streeter 14—24TFH and is permitted and drilled in 2013. In the initial unit development plan this pad was intended to change into a tri-pad, but due to a large archeological site in this area this was not a possibility so the pad <br/>remained as a single well—pad. </p>

This pad was converted to a dual-well pad to include one additional well. Pad Q includes the CCU Columbian l4—36TFH and the CCU Columbian 24-36TFH; these wells were drilled in late 2013 and early 2014. </p>

This pad was converted to a quad-well pad in order to accommodate two additional TF wells and a MB well that was moved from Pad Q. The wells included on this pad are the CCU Columbian 33-1MBH, CCU Columbian 33-1TFH, CCU Columbian 43-1MBH, and the CCU Columbian 43-1TFH. Due to rough topography and in order to avoid surface disturbance this pad was moved outside the unit boundary, the intermediate section are directionally drilled, the horizontal portions of the wells will honor the unit setbacks. These wells have been drilled. <br/>Pad T is a new tri-well pad located in the NE/4 of Section 26, Tl47N-R95W. This pad will include the CCU Burner 41-26TFH, CCU Burner 41-26MBH and CCU North Coast 11-25TFH; <br/>these wells were drilled in 2014. <br/>Pad U was initially a dual well pad in the SW/4 of Section 31, T148N-R95W. This pad was relocated to the SW/4 of Section 18, T147N-R95W and it was converted into a quad pad to accommodate TF wells. This pad was moved in order to mitigate environmental risk of having a well location on the drainage path of the Little Missouri River. This location has been reviewed by a state inspector. The wells on this pad are the CCU Pullman 14-7TFH, CCU Pullman 14- <br/>Page 9 of 10 Corral Creek—Bakken Unit Q3-2014 </p>

These wells were re—planned with new names, permitted, and are currently <br/>drilling <br/>Pad V was initially a dual well pad in the NW/4 of Section 5, Tl47N-R95W. This pad was relocated to the SE/4 of Section 18, T147N-R95W and it was converted into a quad pad to accommodate TF wells. This pad was moved in order to mitigate environmental risk of having a well location on the drainage path of the Little Missouri River. This location has been reviewed by a state inspector. The wells on this pad are the CCU Pullman 34-7TFH, CCU Pullman 347MBI-l, CCU Pullman 44-7TFH and the CCU Pullman 44-7MBH; these wells are scheduled to be drilled in 2014. These wells were re-planned with new names, permitted, and are currently <br/>drilling <br/>Pad W was initially a dual well pad on the SE/4 of Section 9, Tl47N—R95W, This pad was converted to a tri well pad in order to accommodate a TF well and it was moved to the south to the NE/4 of Section 16, T147N—R95W. It was moved so it could be closer to HWY 22 in an effort to minimize surface disturbance. The wells on this pad are CCU Red River 24-9MBH, CCU Red River 34-9TFH and CCU Red River 34-9MBH; these wells have been drilled. <br/>Pad X is a dual well pad to be located in the SESE of Section 35, T147N-R94W. The wells on this pad will be the Olympian 44-35TFl-I and the Olympian 44—35MBH. These wells were drilled <br/>in Q2 2014. </p>

Construction of the CTB was completed <br/>in 2012. <br/>The location of the CCU Powell CTB #2 was initially on the border of Sections 28 and 29, T147N-R95W and was moved west to the NW/4 of Section 29, T147N—R95W closer to the existing lease road in an effort to minimize surface disturbance and better serve the surrounding well pads. Construction of the CTB was initiated in 2012 and was completed in 2013. <br/>The location of the CCU Burner CTB #6 will remain in the SE/4 of Section 23, Tl47N-R95W. Construction of the CTB was completed in 2013. <br/>The location of the CCU Bison Point CTB#8 was initially in SW/4 of Section 34, Tl47N-R94W.

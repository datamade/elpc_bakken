ND <br/>3.3.1 Main Horizontal The formation had an average dip of 0.82’l100’ downdip or 89.530 or .47 dip down. Dip . calculations were conducted along the entire length of the lateral from entry into the Three Forks <br/>at 11376’ MD to TD of 20560’ MD, using gamma ray, lithology, and anticipated structure. Dip changes can be found in Table 3.2. <br/>Table 3.2 Formation Dip Calculations <br/>  <br/>Depths Dip <br/>  <br/>4.0 SHOWS We had good sample quality until about 16600’ MD. From 16600’ MD to TD of 20560’ MD, <br/>the samples were slightly too moderately to very saturated with envirotorque. The samples that were slightly too moderately saturated with envirotorque only affected the hydrocarbon shows. <br/>PAGE .17 </p>

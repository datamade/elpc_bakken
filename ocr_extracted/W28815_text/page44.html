JAMES 16X-351L4 WILLLS'TON, NB <br/>1.0 INTRODUCTION <br/>James 16X-35HA is a north lateral Three Forks well located SE/SE in SEC 35, T152N, R100W, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The primary target zone was 15’- 32’ under the top of the Three Forks Formation. The target zone is used primarily because of its distinct gamma characteristics which are used to help directional drill the lateral. The objective was to steer the well within the deﬁned target zone and within the legal requirements of the state. Directional and MWD services were performed by Pathﬁnder.

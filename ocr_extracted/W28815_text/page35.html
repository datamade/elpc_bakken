    <p class="styleSans557.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>SMii <br/>ENERGY Seattle 1-35H CTB — VRU Allocation Process <br/>The Seattle 1-35H CT 8 is also slated for a vapor recovery unit (VRU). <br/>This VRU is a modular compressor skid, plumbed on the suction side to the fiberglass piping that connects all oil and water tank overhead vents. A pressure transducer will be installed on this overhead fiberglass piping in order to provide the control signal for compressor driver speed. In other words, a va riable-frequency drive (VFD) will match the compressor speed with the tank vapor production at any given time, with appropriate low-level shutdown signal to turn the compressor off at low vapor pressures and thus avoid pulling vacuum (negative) pressures on the Vent system. <br/>The gas gathering company (Hiland) has previously disallowed a direct connection between the VRU compressor discharge and the gas gathering line. For this reason, the compressor discharge will be routed into the flowline upstream of two separate treaters, with isolation valving such that compressed tank vapors can only be directed to a single treater at any given time, but a redundant treater will be available should one be ta ken out of service at any point. Additionally, the vapor compressor discharge can be sent directly to the site flare if either of the treaters is unavailable <br/>for any reason. <br/>The VRU skid is composed of a (lube) oil-flooded screw compressor, separate inlet and discharge scrubbers, a 50—hp electric motor to drive the screw compressor, a gas discharge aftercooler, and a downstream oxygen sensor such that any oxygen-rich compressed gas can be diverted to flare, and so avoid creating a potential combustion source inside the <br/>treaters. <br/>The allocation scheme for these compressed vapors requires the use of both the sales meter on the treater and the discharge meter on the VRU skid. A simple subtraction of the VRU skid meter from the treater sales meter will give the gas sales for the treater’s well. The allocation of the vapor sales will be based on the percentage of the oil production <br/>from each well flowing into the battery at that time. <br/>  </p>

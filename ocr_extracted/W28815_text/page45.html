JAMES I6X-35E-i WELISTON, M <br/>2.0 SERVICES <br/>2.1 Wellsite Geology (Basin Geologic Consulting, Inc.) <br/>Geological consulting and mudlogging started on 10/4/2014 and was completed on 10/22/2014. Services provided included; morning reports, sample examination, production of mud and horizontal log, geo-steering, and a ﬁnal end of well report. <br/>2.2 Mud Logging (Basin Geologic Consulting, Inc.) 2.2.1 Sample Examination <br/>Samples were collected every 30’ from 10700’ MD to the end of the curve at 11492’ MD. The samples were collected every 100’ or as needed in the lateral from 11492’ MD to the end of lateral at 20560’ MD. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, ﬁrmness, argillaceous content, structure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon ﬂuorescence. Carbonate identiﬁcation was determined with 10% dilute HCl, and alizarin red. Hydrocarbon ﬂuorescence was determined using a ﬂuoroscope with a UV lamp. <br/>2.2.2 Gas Detection <br/>Gas was logged using the Pason Total Gas System (TGAS). The Pason TGAS is an unmanned system designed to measure the amount of gases exiting the wellbore and then calculate the lag time to show the formation depth where the gases were produced. Gas samples are collected and analyzed right at the shaker. The Pason TGAS works in conjunction with the Pason EDR which displays historical and current total percent pas at a speciﬁc depth or time. The Pason TGAS system also changes lag time calculations to optimize accuracy of data using ﬁve different formula options. <br/>2.2.3 Gas Detector Incidents <br/>During the drilling of the lateral the following incidents occurred: <br/>0 No gas detector incidents while drilling the lateral. <br/>3.0 GEOLOGY <br/>3.1 Formation Tops <br/>Uphole formation tops were picked using ROP, lithology, and gamma ray to identify markers in the curve and lateral (Table 3.1). <br/>PAGE 3 </p>

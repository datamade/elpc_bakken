Individual flowlines will be ran from each wellhead to the CTB. Each well within the CTB will have one 6’ x 20’ 125 psi treater, two 400-bbi production oil tanks, oil coriolis meter downstream of the oil tanks before tyin into a LACT unit, a total produced gas meter and a gas sales custody transfer meter, and a water meter off the dump valve of the treater.

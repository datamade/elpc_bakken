A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Light gray brown, medium gray, cream gray, wackestone to packstone, slightly argillaceous, ANI-IDRITE: 25% cream gray, white, gummy, poor to moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered dull yellow ﬂuorescence, good cloudy yellow green cut. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Rival Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,986’ and a TVD of 9,980’, which was one foot higher than the prognosis. The Rival was picked using gamma signatures and lithology changes. The samples in the upper portion of the Rival were as follows; LIMESTONE: Gray, medium to dark gray brown, light brown, micritic to packstone, slightly argillaceous, carbonaceous in part, 10% off white anhydrite, poor to moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, spotty dull yellow white ﬂuorescence, fair cloudy yellow cut. <br/>Lodgepole 10,526’MD 10,519’ TVD - 7,866’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 10,526’ and a TVD of 10,519’, which was right on the prognosis. The Lodgepole Formation was picked from using gamma signatures along with a lithology changes. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Light to medium gray, light gray brown, off white, wackestone to packstone, argillaceous, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered yellow white fluorescence, cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Curve 11,002— 11,885 ’ MD <br/>The curve was started at a kick off point of 11,002’ MD, 476’ below the Lodgepole. The bit and bottom hole assembly were changed out for a directional assembly at 11,002’ MD for drilling the curve. Penetration rates of the curve averaged 60 — 8O ft/hr while sliding. The BHA was pulled on November 16, 2014 due to slow ROP. The BHA #4 was changed out at 11,357’. The maximum trip gas was 4,293 units. The Curve was landed on November 18, 2014 at 6:30 A.M. CST, 25’ into the Three Forks Formation at a true vertical depth of 1 1,516.56’. Casing was completed on November 19, 2014. Seven inch 35# weight casing was set to a measured depth of <br/>11,870’ and cement ﬁlled the remainder of the wellbore down to the curve landing MD of 11,885’. <br/>False Bakken 11,440’MD 11,365’ TVD - 8, 712’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 11,440’ and a TVD of 1 1,365’. The lithology of the False Bakken consisted of limestone. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Dark gray, gray tan, charcoal dark gray, trace of shale, scattered tan, ﬁrm, tight, argillaceous in part, fair to poor intergranular porosity, patchy bright yellow ﬂuorescence, instant pinpoint streaming, good cloudy yellow cut. </p>

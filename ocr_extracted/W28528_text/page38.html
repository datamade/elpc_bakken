The initial phase of the Peterson 41-33XH is a vertical and curve, landing in the Middle Bakken. The Peterson 41-33XH spudded August 4, 2014 and reached a total depth of 20,366’MD on August 18, 2014. Wellsite geological services began at 8,500 feet in the Charles F ormation. Thirty and ﬁfty foot lagged samples were collected. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 8, 500’ —- 9, 900’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 8,500 feet measured depth in The Charles Formation. Gas detection system was recalibrated and tested before logging depth with system functioning correctly. Drill rates ranged from 1.0-3.5 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 20—40 units. <br/>Base of the Last Salt 8, 706’ MD 8, 704’ T VD ~6, 538’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered at 8,704’ TVD; -6,538’ SS. Base of the last salt was picked by the last sample with salt present. Samples then became beds of limestone, shale and occasional anhydrate, until the Mission Canyon. <br/>[Mission Canyon 8,883 ’ MD 8,881 ’ T VD -6, 715’ SS <br/>Mission Canyon was picked from lithology change and the offset log, ROP was .13-7.67 minutes a foot. Samples consisted of: Limestone: Light brown, light gray, trace mottled, mudstone, dolomitic, trace argillaceous, moderate induration, trace anhydn'te, white, cryptocrystalline, tight, trace dead oil staining, mineral ﬂuorescence only, slow pale yellow orange cut. Gas ranged from 17-236 units. <br/>Lodgepole 9,528’MD 9,526’ TVD -6,802’SS <br/>The top of the Lodgepole was picked at 9,528 feet measured depth from the gamma marker and sample change. Drill rates in the Lodgepole ranged from .37-2. 13 minutes per foot rotating with gas ranging from 11-101 units. Typical samples were: Limestone: Light to medium gray brown, medium to dark gray, light grey in part, trace cream, off—white, microcrystalline, fair amounts of blocky chops, platy in part, moderately hard to soft, no visible porosity, no ﬂuorescence, no cut. KOP was at 9,900’ MD. </p>

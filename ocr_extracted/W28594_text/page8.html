(Pb =3520 psi, Pc=2020 psi). intermediate Casing: 7" 29# P4 10 LT&C casing (Pb: H.220 psi, Pc :8510 psi) run tojust above the salt intervals (surface to 7.012 R); and 7" 32% P-l l0 LT&C ( Pb: l2,460 psi. Pc: |0,760 psi) from above the salt intervals to the horizontal in the Middle Bakken interval (7,0!2 to “,5” l1). <br/>Uneemented Liner: 4%" I 1.61% P-l l0 BTC (Pb:10.690 psi. Pc=7560 psi) set ﬁom above KOP to the end of the lateral (10,660 to 21,796 ft). <br/>Liner hanger plan to set at approximately 100’ above KOP at 10,660’ (in the ugger Lodgepole Fm). </p>

    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">A Polished Bore Receptacle is run above the liner hangar. <br/>The completion method is Plug and Part; with one sliding sleeve in the toe stage. Plan for 35 swell packers. Plan spacing is 294‘ per stgge. <br/>Two l0,000 psi frac valves are set on the wellhead; typically both are 7-I/l6“ bore valves with the upper valve being remotely hydraulically operated. <br/>Stimulation: Slickwater hydraulic fracture treatments, will be performed through i'mermediate casing string. <br/>Typical rates are 40 to 70 bpm; with average wellhead treating pressures of 6800 to 7800 psi. <br/>Pressure Rating: The wellhead and intermediate casing string are pressure tested per state testing requirements at 9500 psi. The ending pressure aﬂer 30 minutes (provided, per state regulations, that it is no less than 5% below the initial test pressure) is then set at the maximum fracture treating pressure. Pop-off <br/>valves are set no more than l00 psi below this pressure; with pump kick-outs staggered over a 300 psi interval below the pop-off setpoint. <br/>Per state requirements a ﬂow line is run from the surface casing valve (connected to the surfaceintermediate casing annulus) to a flowback tank. An electronic pressure gauge is mounted on this line and the pressure data continuously displayed and recorded throughout pumping operations. </p>

Mountrail County Parshall 89-3029H (Well File # 29525), Surface location T152N, R90W, 5th P.M. Mountrail County Parshall 90-3029H (Well File # 29526), Surface location T152N, R90W, 5th P.M. Mountrail County <br/>The above wells will use “Continuous Measurement" and as a group have diverse ownership. Continuous measurement for above wells will be located at the "Parshall Section 30 NENW" central production facility to be constructed on the same pad of where the wellheads are located. <br/>Each well will flow into a single separator/treater located at the Central Facility where oil, water, and gas will be separated and continuous measurement used on each well as follows: <br/>1) <br/>2) <br/>3) <br/>Per well continuous measurement oil volumes will be used to allocate actual stook tank oil volumes delivered through central facility commingled “oil sales" LACT back to individual well(s). Oil device will be Coriolis meter using Electronic Flow Measurement (EFM) and appropriate industry and manufacturer standards. Each well will have a tank that can be isolated and used as a test tank for the proving of its Coriolis meter. <br/>Per well continuous measurement of gas volumes will be used to allocate actual standard condition gas volumes delivered through central facility “gas sales" meters back to individual well(s). Gas measurement device will be either orifice plate or wedge meters using EFM and apprOpriate industry and manufacturer standards. <br/>Per well continuous measurement water volumes will be used to allocate actual water volumes trangnnrfad out of central fanilitv hank tn individual well(s) Water device will he Vnrtey Sheddinn </p>

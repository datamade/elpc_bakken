    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Triangle USA Petroleum Corporation Simpson 151-102-5—8-2H was the 1St vertical and curve and the 3rd lateral of 3 wells located on Section 5 T151N R102W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Simpson 151-102-5-8—2H was spudded on September 6, 2014 with surface drilled and cased to be resumed at a later date. Patterson 320 spudded the Simpson 151-102-5-8—2H on October 12, 2014 and reached a total depth of 20,700’ MD on December 14, 2014. Wellsite geological services began at 8,300 on October 13, 2014 at 6:40 PM MST. The initial phase of the Simpson 151-102-5-8—2H is a vertical and curve landing in the Middle Bakken Formation on October 24 2014. The single lateral well targeting the Middle Bakken Formation approximately 11’-1 5 ’ below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale was started on December 8, 2014. Thirty-foot samples were collected throughout the vertical and curve with ﬁﬁy—foot samples collected in the lateral. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 8,300’ — 1 0, 44 7’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 8,300’ MD in the lower Opeche formation on October 13, 2014 at 6:40 PM MST. Gas detection system was tested before logging depth with system ﬁmctioning correctly. Drill rates before encountering the Kibbey Lime formation ranged from 0.09-2.2 minutes per foot and averaging 0.94 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 11-45 units averaging 17 units. A typical sample was: SILTSTONE: Gray, light gray, dark gray, brown, orange, red, tan, cream, white, calcareous, argillaceous, dolomitic, poor to moderate induration, anhydrite, limestone, yellow—green ﬂuorescence, good fast milky cut. <br/>Kibbey Lime 8,530’ MD 8,529’ T VD -6,207’ SS <br/>The Kibbey Lime was picked 3 feet lower than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and differential pressure. Drill rates in the Kibbey Lime formation ranged from 0.13—2.35 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 0.58 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 11-28 units averaging 17 units. A typical sample was: ANYHDRITE: White to cream tan, soft to pasty, 15% limestone, light gray to gray, packstone, argillaceous, dolomitic in part, poor to fair induration, poor intergranular porosity, spotty blue ﬂorescence, fair milky cut. At 8,535’ MD a planned trip was performed on 10/13/14 at 11:00 PM MST to change out BILA. Once ﬁnished drilling of vertical was resumed at 9:00 AM MST on 10/ 14/ 14. </p>

The coriolis meter will be a FMC Coriolis Promass 83F meter, MicroMotion F-Series, or a Micro-Motion CMF 200. <br/>Water <br/>Water will be measured through tank gauges and run tickets and corioilis meters. The water meter will be a FMC Coriolis Promass 83F meter, MicroMotion F—Series, Micro—Motion CMF 200, NuFlo MC—II+ turbine meter, or NuFlow MC-lll turbine meter. <br/>Gas Gas will be measured via v-cone or orifice plate meter. <br/>Proving Proving will be done by measuring produced well liquid volumes (1) in series through the well meter and <br/>a master meter or (2) comparing metered volumes with dedicated tank gauges. <br/>  </p>

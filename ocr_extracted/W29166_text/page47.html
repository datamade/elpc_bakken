The surface location for the well is located 525’ FSL and 288’ FEL in Section 7 T154N R98W. The well was drilled from south to north ﬁnishing at approximately 303.49’ FSL and 618.63’ FWL, in Section 5 T154N R98W of Williams County. Kelly bushing elevation was estimated at 2,436’.This well was drilled using an invert (oil based) mud system during the straight hole and build portion and salt water throughout the lateral. Jared Bryl and Thomas Osadchuk of Neset Consulting Service Inc. provided wellsite mudlogging services beginning at a depth of 8,800’ MD through the end of the Middle Bakken lateral which reached a total measured depth of 2 l ,290’ MD on March 6, 2015 at <br/>7:30 am CST. </p>

A NOV Penless drilling recorder was used for rate of penetration and depth. A M9 Mudlogging Instrument was used for reading total gas and Cl through C4. Thirty foot lagged samples were caught through the end of the curve. <br/>Kibbey Lime 8,869’ MD 8,852 ’ TVD -6,4I6’ SS <br/>Logging was started just above the expected top of the Kibbey Lime with samples showing reddish brown Limestone. A slight change in the consistency of samples and drill rates occurred around 8,869’ MD. Top of the Kibbey Lime was estimated to be at 8,883' TVD, based off changes in drill rates and samples. Even though top was 31 feet high of original prognosis, no changes to landing target were made at that time. Drill rates averaged 40 — 120 ft/hr, with total gas remaining fairly low at around 10 - 20 units. </p>

Top of salts was 18 feet high of original depth on the prognosis. Again, no changes to landing target were made at that time. Drill rates continued to average 75 — 190 ft/hr while drilling in the salt, picking up off bottom and reaming occasionally to avoid getting stuck. An abundant amount of salt was observed in all samples with varying amounts of reddish brown sandstone. Total gas continued to average around 10 — 20 units. </p>

The Base of Last Salt came in approximately 24 feet higher than depth on prognosis. Even though this was signiﬁcantly higher than expected, no changes to landing target were made. Continuing to drill further down, there were no more signiﬁcant drill breaks or signs of salt. Samples transitioned to </p>

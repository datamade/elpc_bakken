While beginning the lateral near the center of the geologic zone of interest, targets were set to reﬂect a 90.0 degree dip rate and wellbore inclination was gradually brought down in order to move up and into the center of the geologic zone of interest. <br/>Drilling ahead 1 1761’ MD to 13,000’ MD formation clip was expected to be ﬂat. Formation gradually appeared to be trending at around 89.9 to 90.1 degrees. Wellbore remained near the center to upper half of the target window to begin. At approximately 12,461 ’ MD we tripped due to an MWD failure. Before we tripped, rate of penetration was from 35 to 280 feet per. Gamma was from 66 to 98 API units. Gas was from A typical sample consisted of; SILTSTONE: Gray, medium gray, light gray, cream gray, brown, dark gray, cream, white, off white, microcrystalline, platy, calcareous cementation, dolomitic, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, dull blue white ﬂuorescence, slow weak white blue cloudy cut. <br/>Continuing to drill ahead from 13,000’ MD to 14,000’ MD wellbore was drilled below the center of the target window, generating moderate conﬁdence in correlations. Continuing to drill ahead wellbore remained in the lower half of the target window and appeared to be tracking with formation. Penetration rates averaged 150 — 290 ft/hr. Gamma continued to between 70 - <br/>1 10 API units. Gas was from 175 to 600 units with increases at connections. A typical sample consisted of, SILTSTONE: Gray, medium gray, light gray, off white, gray brown, dark gray, light brown, cream, microcrystalline, platy, sucrosic, calcareous cementation, dolomitic, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, dull blue yellow ﬂuorescence, diffuse white yellow cloudy cut. <br/>Continuing to drill ahead past 14,000’ MD to 15,000’ MD the wellbore was drilled in the lower half of the target window. At approximately 14,468 the target was raised 2’ TVD and the inclination was raised 1 degree. Correlations remained poor to fair, but suggested formation dip had steepened and was now estimated at 90.1 degrees. Rate of penetration was from 175 to 325 feet per hour. Gamma was from 55 to 90 API units. Gas was from 200 to 800 units with increases for connection gas. Samples made very little change and were typically described as; SILTSTONE: Medium gray, light gray, light brown, cream gray, off white, light gray brown, cream, dark gray, microcrystalline, sucrosic, trace platy, calcareous to siliceous cementation, dolomitic, moderate induration, ﬁ'iable, poor intergranular porosity, scattered dull blue ﬂuorescence, slow weak streaming cloudy cut. The use of Enviro-Torq used to minimize torque and anti—foam agents, altered any potential oil shows. <br/>Over the next 1,000’ MD from 15,000’ MD to 16,000’ MD wellbore remained fairly ﬂat with a slight trending up dip, and was drilled in the upper part of the target window. Targets were 3 feet TVD and inclination was raised to 90.3 degrees. This change in targets occurred at approximately 15,476’ MD or 4,000’ TVD. Penetration rates were from 190 to 350 feet per hour. Gamma was between 60 to 100 API units. Gas was from 250 to 2,700 units with increases for connection gas to over 13,000 units. Samples were of little help with conﬁrming well’s position in zone as they continued to make very little if any change in consistency. The typical sample was; SILTSTONE: Medium gray, light gray brown, light gray, cream gray, off white, dark gray, microcrystalline, platy, calcareous cementation, siliceous cementation, dolomitic, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, trace pyrite, dull blue ﬂuorescence, slow streaming white cloudy cut. <br/>Drilling ahead past 16,000” MD to 17,000’ MD wellbore remained at the top of the target window and appeared to be following formation. At approximately 16,981 ’ MD or 5,500’ VS targets were raised 3.0 feet TVD and inclination remained at 90.3 degrees. Rates of penetration </p>

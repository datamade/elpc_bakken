The top of the Lodgepole was picked at 10,467’ TVD using a slight change in drill rates and gamma to conﬁrm the Lodgepole. Drill rates began to drop off slightly once several feet into the Lodgepole formation. KOP was reached at 10,785‘ <br/>MD and a trip out of the hole was made to pick up curve tools. Beginning the build portion, drill rates averaged 40 — 60 ﬁ/hr while sliding 90 — 100 %. <br/>Samples continued to show gray argillaceous dolomitic limestone. Gamma markers in the upper portion of the formation were smprisingly good, each generating consistent landing targets. The upper to middle Lodgepole markers suggested the Middle Bakken was coming in slightly higher than anticipated, but no changes to target were made. <br/>Markers through the middle and lower portions of the Lodgepole showed the distance between markers was slightly thicker than the ﬁrst half of the formation. This suggested the Middle Bakken would come in on target. No changes to target were made at the time since current target was within a few feet of the ideal landing target. <br/>Upper Bakken 11,455’ MD 11,267' TVD -8,831 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Upper Bakken was reached at approximately 1 1,455’ MD / 11,267’ TVD, 3’ higher than originally predicted on the prognosis. The formation top was ﬁrst estimated in real time with drill rates then reﬁned by the gamma. Samples transitioned to black carbonaceous shale with total gas increasing to average 250 — 300 units and over 400 units at connection. After reaching the base of the shale the total thickness was estimated to be 19’, this is 1’ thinner than <br/>predicted on the prognosis. </p>

This suggested a ﬁnal landing target of 1 1,306' TVD at 20 feet below the upper shale, one foot lower than ﬁnal landing target. Samples transitioned to gray argillaceous siltstone with drill rates averaging 20 - 40 ft/hr, total gas averaging 100 — 250 units. Continuing to drill ahead, wellbore dropped in structure slightly as gamma ﬂuctuated around 80-90 API. At approximately 18’ into Middle Bakken at 89.20 degrees, the curve was landed at 1 1,304” TVD, 1’ above the ﬁnal landing target. Total depth of the curve was reached at 1 1,761’ MD on December 1, 2014 at 2:45 pm CST. </p>

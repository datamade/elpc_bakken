    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The US Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has received a proposal to drill Eighteen Potential Bakken/Three Forks Exploratory Oil and Gas Wells on Two Well Pads in the following locations: <br/>0 Fort Berthold #152-93-9C-10-7H, -8H, -9H, -1OH, -11H, -12H, -13H, -14H, -15H (Bonita): Lots 7 and 8 of Section 8, Township (T) 152 North (N), Range (R) 93 West (W), McKenzie County, North Dakota <br/>0 Fort Berthold #152-93-7C-6-5H, -6H, -7H, -8H, -9H, ~10H, ~11H, -12H, -13H (Vermejo): Lot 11 and SE% SW% of Section 7, T152N, R93W, McKenzie County, North Dakota <br/>Associated federal actions by the BIA include determinations of effect regarding environmental resources and positive recommendations to the Bureau of Land Management regarding the Applications for Permit to Drill. <br/>The potential of the proposed action to impact the human environment is analyzed in the following Environmental Assessment (EA), as required by the National Environmental Policy Act. Based on the EA, l have determined that the proposed project will not significantly affect the quality of the human or natural environment. No Environmental Impact Statement is required for any portion of the proposed activities. <br/>This determination is based on the following factors: <br/>1. Agency and public involvement solicited for the preceding NEPA document was sufficient to ascertain potential environmental concerns associated with the currently proposed project. <br/>2. Protective and prudent measures were designed to minimize impacts to air, water, soil, vegetation, wetlands, wildlife, public safety, water resources, and cultural resources. The remaining potential for impacts was disclosed for both the proposed action and the No Action alternatives. <br/>3. Guidance from the US Fish and Wildlife Service has been fully considered regarding wildlife impacts, particularly in regard to threatened or endangered species. This guidance includes the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.) (MBTA), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) (NEPA), the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668d, 54 Stat. 250) (BGEPA), Executive Order 13186 “Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds”, and the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) (ESA). <br/>4. The proposed action is designed to avoid adverse effects to historic, archaeological, cultural and traditional properties, sites and practices. Compliance with the procedures of the National Historic Preservation Act is complete. </p>

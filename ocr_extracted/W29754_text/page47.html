Pyrite was encountered in the lower portion of the 10’ target zone. Porosity and oil shows were fair to good across the lateral. All samples were of excellent quality. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Avalanche 36—15 TF1 well was drilled within the Three Forks Bench 1 formation. One hundred foot (100‘) samples were taken across the entire lateral. The vertical and curve were drilled without any remarkable events. Formation samples throughout the entire well were of excellent quality exhibiting fair to good porosity and oil shows in the Three Forks. Total gas across the lateral averaged 1072 units with a <br/>maximum reading of 3675 units. Maximum trip gas at the beginning of the lateral was 3221 units. <br/>This well is currently awaiting completion. <br/>Dan Grifﬁn Wellsite Mudlogger </p>

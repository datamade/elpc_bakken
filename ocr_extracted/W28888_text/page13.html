The pick was made from the ROP on the mud log. Background gas was 78 units with an average ROP of 1.08 min/ft. Typical sample; LIMESTONE: Light brown, gray, grayish white, microcrystalline, argillaceous, anhydritic, moderately indurated, trace intercrystalline porosity, mineral <br/>ﬂuorescence only, no cut. <br/>Midale Porosity 7,932’ MD 7,930’ T VD -5, 522 ’ SS <br/>The Midale Porosity pick was made from the ROP on the mud log. Background gas was 129 units with an average ROP of .74 min/ft. Typical sample; L]1V[ESTONE: Dark brown, brown, light gray, wackestone, mudstone in part, argillaceous, moderately indurated, trace to fair intercrystalline porosity, trace dead oil staining, weak ﬂuorescence, slow cut. <br/>Mission Canyon 7,962’ MD 7,960’ T VD -5,552’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon pick was made using ROP off the mud log. It came in at 7,960’ TVD. Background gas was 115 units, ROP average was 1.41 minutes a foot. Dead oil staining throughout the Mission Canyon was observed which is common to this area. A typical sample was; LIMESTONE: Medium to light brown, dark brown in part, wackestone, argillaceous, poor to moderate induration; no Visible porosity, rare dead oil <br/>staining, dull dark green ﬂuorescence, no cut. </p>

This pick was made off ROP. ROP averaged 1.58 min/ﬂ: and background gas was 119 units. Typical sample for this formation: L11VIESTONE: Gray, dark gray, microcrystalline, argillaceous, dolomitic in part, moderately indurated, trace intercrystalline porosity, no visible oil staining, faint green ﬂuorescence, no out <br/>Upper Bakken 9,224 ’ MD 9,148’ T VD -6, 740’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was picked from ROP, gamma and lithology change. ROP averaged .80 minutes a foot with background gas averaging 325 units. Gamma was off the charts. A sample from this section; SHALE: Black, blocky, carbonaceous, very calcareous, trace disseminated pyrite; even dull grayish green ﬂuorescence, instant bright blooming milky cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 9,248’ MD 9,164’ T VD -6, 756’ SS </p>

It is a horizontal well targeting the Three Forks Formation with surface spud on August 20th and intermediate being spud on August 23rd, 2014. The 2HS reached a total depth of 19,139’ MD on September 12", 2014. 9 5/8” surface casing was set to 2,078’ MD. 7” casing was set at 9,639’ MD. The mud system was invert for the vertical and curve portion and salt water for the horizontal. Trevor Meyers and Kathleen Meyers of Neset Consulting Service Inc. provided mudlogging and geological services. Total gas detector services were utilized throughout this well. Lagged samples were caught and saved for archive at 30’ intervals. Samples were caught every 15’ through production zones in the Midale and Mission Canyon Formations. Sample quality was good in the vertical and curve. At times samples were poor in the lateral due to lube sweeps. <br/>Kibbey Lime 7,059’ MD 7,05 7’ T VD -4, 649’ SS <br/>The pick for the Kibbey Lime was made from ROP off the mud log. ROP averaged 1.03 minutes a foot with background gas of 49 units. Samples in the formation were; ANHYDRITIC LIMESTONE: Brown, tan, light brown, trace pale green cryptocrystalline to microcrystalline, sandy in part, argillaceous, moderately indurated, poor intercrystalline porosity; anhydrite, grayish white, off white, cream, amorphous; trace dead oil staining, mineral ﬂuorescence only, no cut. No signiﬁcant hydrocarbons were observed. <br/>Charles Salt 7,220’ 1WD 7,218’ T VD -4,810’ SS <br/>The Charles Salt pick was made using WOB from Pason and ROP off the mud log, along with sample change. It came in at 7,218’ TVD. Background gas was 41 units and ROP averaged .74 minutes a foot. A typical sample was; SALT: Clear, frosty, hard, massive; anhydritic limestone, gray, grayish white, microcrystalline, argillaceous, poorly indurated; anhydrite, grayish white, amorphous, soﬁ, gritty; no visible porosity, mineral ﬂuorescence only, no out </p>

ROP averaged 035 minutes a foot in the salts. Gas averaged 61 units. A typical sample was; SALT: Frosty, clear, blocky, hard; trace limestone, light to dark gray, microcrystalline, argillaceous, tight; no shows. </p>

ROP averaged .99 minutes a foot with background gas averaging 381 units with a high of 769 units. Gamma was off the charts. A sample from this section; SHALE: Near black, dark gray, carbonaceous, blocky, platy, slightly calcareous, disseminated pyrite, fossiliferous, even greenish gray ﬂuorescence, fast streaming milky cut. <br/>Three Forks 9,460’ MD 9,262’ T VD -6,854’ SS </p>

Samples to this pornt 1n the formation were; SANDSTONE: Tan, light gray, light brown, off white in part, very ﬁne to ﬁne grained, well rounded, well sorted, good dolomitic cementation, trace disseminated pyrite, trace intergranular porosity; interbedded siltstone, light green, poor calcite cementation, poorly indurated; faint petroliferous odor, even grayish green/yellow pinpoint ﬂuorescence, instant cloudy cut. <br/>Lateral 9,639’ — 19,139’ MD <br/>Landed the curve at MD 9,639’, TVD 9,281’ at 5:30 PM CDT on August 29th, 2014 and started drilling the horizontal at 6:30 PM CDT on September lst, 2014. ROP averaged 0.22 minutes per foot with background gas averaging 93 units. Three trips were conducted for MWD tool at 12,298’ MD, 14,116’ MD and 16,402’ MD. A typical sample was: SANDSTONE: Light tan to off white, light brown, ﬁne grained, well rounded, well sorted, good to moderate dolomitic cementation, pyritic, trace intergranular porosity; interbedded siltstone, light green, light gray, poor calcite cementation, poorly indurated; <br/>even grayish green pinpoint ﬂuorescence, slow cloudy cut.TD of 19,139’ MD and 9303.5’ TVD was reached on September 12th, 2014 at 2:05 PM CDT: <br/>Trevor Meyers Wellsite Geolgt'st </p>

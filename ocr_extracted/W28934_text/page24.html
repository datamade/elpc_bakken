    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Upper Bakken structure map provided by Continental Resources in the well packet indicated we would have an upward trend through the entire lateral, with a ﬁnal Middle Baldcen top depth of 8323’ TVD, rendering a projected up dip of about 90.6°. The actual ﬁnal target depth appeared about 8371’, and average clip was 9039". <br/>Over the course of the well, safety meetings were held with each tour daily, generally concerning both ongoing safety concerns (i.e. Housekeeping, cleaning) and event-speciﬁc concerns (i.e. tripping, casing), and BOP drills were periodically conducted. <br/>Casing operations were conducted from the evening of Aug. 8th through the afternoon of Aug. 9th. Drilling the lateral began on the morning of Aug. 10th. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Gas shows through the Upper Bakken ranged from 50 to 336 units. The Middle Bakken gas units were around 50 units in the curve, and anywhere ﬁom 50-1500 units throughout the lateral, decreasing signiﬁcantly a little before the side track. This coincided with a change in company hands, and a change in lubricant sweep amounts and concentrations. The lubricant tended to absorb and thus suppress background gas, with C1-C4 especially affected. This conclusion was <br/>reached after exhaustive, and continual, checking of all gas detection equipment ﬁom the gas trap to the sensors, with no issue being found. <br/>The general steering plan was to drill in the clean lime bed of the Middle Bakken, tagging either high or low as dip changed one way or the other. With the amplitude difference in the signatures, it should have been easy to tell whether we were high or low, and adjust accordingly. However, this was predicated on ﬁnding the expected 12’ of clean calcareous siltstone, which proved not to be the case. Instead, we had 4’ of the clean bed, which pinched out on two occasions, the ﬁrst of which led to a shale strike. We still aimed to stay in the clean as much as <br/>possible, but most of the time in zone was spent in the 2’ allowed on the high and low side to turn the bore around when either marker was encountered. <br/>The Middle Bakken lithology consisted of a dolomitic siltstone, with varying degrees of dolomitic cement and argillaceous material. In the beds showing cooler on the gamma proﬁle, dolomitic cement dominated, with some purer dolomite and calcite content as well, providing <br/>crystalline material within the siltier sample. The uppermost marker and the lower 2/ 3rds of formation underlying target were signiﬁcantly more argillaceous in nature. <br/>The average apparent dip of the formation was 039° up, drilling north, rising at varying clip levels throughout. The mean azimuth of the lateral was 35 9.2". We were in zone 82% of the bore, a decent rate considering the narrowed expected zone. <br/>Drilling additives were added for lubrication purposes starting around 1225 0’ MD, as noted on the Pason workstation. These began as 20-barrel sweeps, changing to 50-barrel sweeps at <br/>144003 MD. These continued through the end of the well, and began proving to be a signiﬁcant sample contaminant from about 225 00’ MD forward. </p>

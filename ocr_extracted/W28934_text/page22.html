    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Continental Resources, Inc drilled the Nygaardsvold lX—3 2H well beginning in the SW corner of the SE quarter of Section 32, Township 162N, Range 95W. The well was spud on Aug. 3"], <br/>2014, beginning at a point 420’ from the South section line and 173 0’ from the East section line using Cyclone Rig #25. The well was planned as an experimentally long 14722” horizontal trace in the upper third of the middle member of the Devonian-Mississippian Bakken formation. The well was drilled vertically for the first 8034’. The cmve was drilled at an azimuth range from 340° to 3°, while the lateral portion was drilled at an average of 359.20 °. The cuive and lateral portion of the well was drilled ﬁ‘om the SW corner of the SE quarter of Section 32 and reached TD in the NW corner of the NW quarter of Section 20 of Township 162N, Range 95W. <br/>NorArn Wellsite Services began providing geological supervision at 6720’ MD, in the lowermost Kibbey formation, to assure intercept of the Charles formation top. This point was reached late in the morning of Aug. 5‘“, and logging began at that point. Total gas was monitored using a NorAm MP23 00 and chromatography was analyzed using a Varian CP4900 Micro-GC Gas Analyzer. NorAm provided geo-steering support using gamma, lithology, ROP, and other drilling data to determine landing TVD and location in the section for the lateral portion of the well. The loggers caught lagged 30’ samples in the vertical and curve portions of the well, and 50’ samples in the lateral. Leam Energy Services provided Directional Drilling (DD) and Measurement While Drilling (MWD) gamma measurements and survey information. <br/>Drilling of the vertical section of the well went well, with formation tops and markers coming in <br/>close to prognosis. The Kick Off Point (KOP) of 8034’ was reached early on the morning of Aug. 18‘". <br/>The curve drilling proceeded well, with good build rates. The initial landing point had been adjusted upward based on the Base of the Last Charles Salt intercept, but was adjusted back <br/>down in the middle of the Lodgepole, and again at the Middle Bakken top, to a point one foot under prognosis. <br/>Drilling of the lateral went well at the beginning, despite a limited target zone. We expected to ﬁnd roughly 12’ of thickness to the upper clean gamma bed; in reality it proved to be 4’ thick. It also periodically pinched out. The ﬁrst pinch was discovered by missing the clean zone and <br/>ending up in the Upper Bakken Shale, at a ﬁnal MD of 153 57’, and gamma intercept at 15296” MD. We sidetracked at 14990” MD and proceeded forward. <br/>Dip at this point had appeared to be 91 .48° based on the Upper Bakken intercept, however, when we broke back into the clean, and went from the now apparent zone top marker to the next top marker, we got a steady reading of 906° average before and after. It was concluded that the clean gamma had likely been pinched out from above, with signiﬁcantly greater thickness between the top of zone and the Upper Bakken base than we had seen drilling the curve. After this it remained a rule of thumb not to get far over zone, presuming that if it could nearly double in thickness beneath the Upper Bakken, it could also signiﬁcantly thin. </p>

Another pinch out was interpreted correctly at about 17100’— 17200’ MD and no shale strike occurred. Drilling went well until TD. </p>

As the turn was completed a target adjustment was made to equate the target window with expected formation dip: target adjustment #2 lowered target line 6’ and slightly lowered inclination to 89.7 degrees. Formation correlated well with this dip at first, but then began to level out closer to 89.8 degrees. At 14,350’ MD, target adjustment #3 raised the target line 3’ and nudged the target inclination up to 89.8 degrees to keep the target window aligned with the ideal geological zone. ROP in the lateral was averaging 300 ft/hr at this time. Formation correlated well at 89.8 degrees for almost exactly 24 hours before gamma indicated that dip was trending closer to the expected structural dip of 89.7 degrees. Target adjustment #4 returned the target inclination to 89.7 degrees and lowered the target line 3’ in zone. Formation dip would ﬂuctuate slightly through a series of localized dips, but would largely match well with the trending pattern of the H-1 offset. Drilling continued normally along the updated targets for the remainder of the lateral. The well was completed 2’ high of the target drilling line, in the upper half of the ideal geological window. <br/>Total depth was reached on December 8, 2014 at 10:55 pm. CST at a measured depth of 20,711’ and a true vertical depth of 10,708.03. The Middle Bakken lateral took a total of 3 days and 1 1 hours to complete, including surveys and down time. The lateral was drilled approximately 90% in zone with an average background gas of 124 units (including connection gases). Average drill rate was 206 ft/hr including slides, with max ROP reaching 325 -3 50 ft/hr continuously in sections. The EN—VP&R-154-94-2536H-2 bottom hole location would be 771.77’ FSL & 811.83’ FELin Section 36 T154N R94W. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">window reaching the base of the Middle Bakken target interval and continued tracking the bottom of the target window up to 16,200’ NID at which point the wellbore dropped through the base of the target window and the ratty gamma at the base of the C faces was seen. As drilling continued slides were done to keep the wellbore pointed up to allow the Middle Bakken target interval to catch up and intersect the path of the wellbore. As this was happening the wellbore built in TVD around 14 feet and the gamma was still showing the warm up from the D faces. It was decided at this point that the formation had changed directions and had begun to run up section at or around 90.4 degrees putting the wellbore about 8 feet below the base of the Middle Bakken target window Slides were done to work on keeping the wellbore at or above 90.5 degrees to work on bringing the wellbore up in TVD to see our repeat of C to D faces contact. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 280 — 300 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 60 - 100 ﬂ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 350 — 500 units with connection gases reaching as high as 1,296 units. The samples seen in the lower portion of the Middle Bakken continued to exhibit a light to medium tan/cream brown dolomite with traces of limestone and siltstone present and an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow/instant streaming cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Day 4 18,905’ —20,510’ MD <br/>Drilling continued with the wellbore sitting about 5 feet below the base of the Middle Bakken target interval. Slides were done throughout the day to work on keeping the wellbore pointed up to work on brining the wellbore up in TVD towards the Middle Bakken target interval. As the base of the target window was entered the wellbore rolled over and began heading down in TVD at around 89 — 88 degrees. Starting at a MD of 19,600’ the MWD tool began to read erratically ranging from 80 — 140 counts. Aﬂer seeing the slides were done to keep the wellbore at or near dip to TD of the S lateral. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 250 - 300 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 60 - 100 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 350 — 800 units with connection gases reaching as high as 1,442 units. The samples seen in the lower portion of the formation continued to exhibit a light to medium tan/cream brown dolomite with traces of limestone and siltstone present and an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Total depth of the South lateral was called at 20,510’ MD for the Arnegard #2126-2H with the wellbore ending in the upper portion of the Middle Bakken. The formation throughout the lateral had an overall estimated dip rate of 90.08 degrees. Total depth of the South Lateral was reached at 20,510’ MD at 4: 15 pm. CST on December 15, 2014 with 9,166’ of open horizontal hole drilled. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">False Bakken 11,215'MD 11,119’ TVD -8, 764’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 11,215’, true vertical depth of 11,119’, one foot low to prognosis. After seeing the False Bakken top the TVD landing target remained at a true vertical depth of 11,161’ @ 90 degrees based off the isopaching from the False Bakken to the Middle Bakken target area in the offset Arnegard wells. Penetration rates through the False Bakken averaged around 15 - 20 ﬁ/hr while sliding. The lithology of the False Bakken exhibited a mixture of light to medium gray limestone and trace to moderate amounts of gray brown shale present. Background gases through the False Bakken increased to around 500 — 1000 units. The False Bakken was evaluated while drilling ahead. <br/>Scallion 11,219’ MD 11,121 ’ TVD -8, 766’ SS <br/>The Scallion was encountered at a measured depth of 11,219’, true vertical depth of 11,121’ as predicted on the prognosis. After seeing the Scallion top the TVD target window remained at a true vertical depth of 11,161’ @ 90 degrees based off the isopaching from the Scallion to the Three Forks target area in the offset Arnegard wells. Penetration rates through the Scallion averaged around 20 - 25 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases in the Scallion averaged around 1,000 — 1,250 units with the samples showing a light to medium gray/cream gray tan limestone with moderate dark gray to black shale present. The Scallion was drilled through from 11,121' to 11,127’ true vertical depth. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 11,231 ’ MD 11,12 7’ T VD -8, 772’ SS <br/>The curve continued on through the remainder of the Scallion and the Upper Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,231’, true vertical depth of 11,127’, one foot high to prognosis. After seeing the Upper Bakken the TVD landing target remained at 11,161’ TVD. Once the Upper Bakken was encountered penetration rates averaged around 15 — 20 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 1,100 — 1,250 units through the Upper Bakken with the samples showing a black/gray brown black carbonaceous shale with occasional limestone present. The Upper Bakken was drilled through and the Middle Bakken was encountered next. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,277’ MD 11,143’ T VD -8, 788’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 11,277’, true vertical depth of 1 l, 143’ as predicted on the prognosis. Penetration rates decreased in the Middle Bakken from around 20 ﬁ/hr to around 12 - 15 ﬁ/hr while sliding. The samples through the upper portion of the Middle Bakken exhibited a gray tan/gray brown dolomite with trace amounts of residual black shale and limestone present. Background gases through the Middle Bakken averaged around 500 — 700 units. Drilling continued on with the curve through the Middle Bakken up to a MD of 11,356'. The curve was landed around <br/>12’ into the Middle Bakken with 89 degrees projected to the bit. </p>

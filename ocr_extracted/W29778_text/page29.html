The top of the Mission Canyon was picked off an increase in penetration rates as well as comparisons to the offsetting wells porosity benches throughout the Mission Canyon. Penetration rates throughout the majority of the Mission Canyon averaged around 80 - 90 ft/hr with increases up to 120 ﬁ/hr seen throughout the porosity benches. The samples throughout the upper 100' of the formation exhibited primarily a gray tan/cream gray tan limestone with trace to moderate anhydrite present and occasional dolomite mixed in. The remainder of the formation exhibited primarily limestone with trace amounts of cream to off—white anhydrite present. Background gases throughout the Mission Canyon averaged around 150 - 200 units with increases up to 337 units through the porosity benches. <br/>Lodgepole 1 0,31 7’ MD 10,313 ’ T VD - 7,958 ’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 10,317’, true vertical depth of 10,313’, two feet high to prognosis. The Lodgepole formation was picked at the base of the lower Mission Canyon porosity as well as a sample change from a cream gray tan limestone to a cream gray/light to medium gray limestone. Gamma was logged across the top of the Lodgepole down to KOP. Gamma correlations up to this point continued to come in consistent with the Arnegard #21-26-3H and the Arnegard #21-26H wells. Penetration rates throughout the formation down to KOP averaged around 80 - 100 ﬂ/hr with background gases averaging around 150 - 180 units. KOP was reached at 2:20 pm. CST on December 9, 2014 at a measured depth of 10,670'. <br/>Curve 10,670'— 11,356’ MD <br/>The curve for the South lateral was started in the Lodgepole Formation at a measured depth of 10,670' at 6:00 am. CST on December 10, 2014. An 8 3/4” Security bit and 2.38 degree ﬁxed mud motor were used to build the curve. The landing target for the Arnegard #21—26—2H at the beginning of the curve was set at 11,163’ @ 90 deg. based off the Lodgepole top and the ﬁrst and second LP marker. The Arnegard #21-26-3H and the Arnegard #21-26H were used for correlation purposes through the curve. Penetration rates at the beginning of the curve averaged around 100 - 130 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases through the Lodgepole formation averaged around 130 — 180 units. The lithology of the Lodgepole exhibited primarily a cream gray tan/light to medium gray limestone with occasional anhydrite and shale present. Gamma markers continued to come in consistently with the Arnegard #21-26-3H and Arnegard #21-26H wells with the TVD landing target at this point raised from 11,163’ TVD to 11,161’. Directional began to fall behind on build rates due and the decision was made at 11,202’ to TOOH to pick up a bigger bend motor and new bit to ﬁnish the curve. The TOOH was completed with a 2.75 degree motor and Security bit picked up. The TIH was completed and drilling resumed with the curve. The remainder of the Lodgepole formation was drilled out and the False Bakken was encountered. </p>

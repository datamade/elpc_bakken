(CRT) respectfully submits the following information concerning the prevention of a wellbore collision while drilling the Bonneville 6-231-12, NWNE Sec. 23, T146N, R96W, Dunn County, North Dakota. <br/>The Bonneville 41—23H is a horizontal well located at 300’ FNL, 1070’ FEL Sec. 23, T146N, R96W. 7” 29 and 32# casing was run and cemented to 11,754’. The Bonneville 6-23H2 will be placed 335’ west of the existing wellbore. Due to a lack of casing in the lateral, avoidance using magnetic interference will not be possible. Field personnel will be made aware of these requirements and precautions will be taken while drilling these intervals to monitor drilling parameters to avoid a collision. <br/>CRI feels that adequate precautions have been taken to prevent the possibility of a wellbore collision and accepts all responsibility should such a collision occur. <br/>Adam Reitz, Project Develop Engineer Continental Resources, Inc. </p>

Make up casing with tongs until the coupling face meets the base of the Triangle stamped on the pipe body. Record the torque values to achieve these standards for the first 10 its. These values can be used to create an average torque value for making up the rest of the casing. Alter running a few jts with this torque value, check to make sure that casing is still being made up to the bottom of the stamped triangle (if not. torque values may need to be adjusted).

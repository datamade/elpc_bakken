    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">amounts of dolomite and lighter colored samples were consistent with the targeted top half of the middle Bakken. The petroleum shows noticeably increased as the lithology shifted. Gas values returned only a modest increase to over 200 total units of gas. <br/>As the halfway mark of the lateral passed, the assembly slowly increased the percentage drilled in zone, despite a strong tendency to fall in rotation. Slight changes to the target angle were made when changes in sample or gamma data allowed. The wellbore weaved over and under the target’s bottom line as a second planned turn in direction approached. Slide drilling for this planned change in azimuth began at 18,000 feet. This turn was a collision avoidance measure and would create distance between this and a preexisting wellbore. <br/>Shortly before completing the second directional turn, a loss of drill rate resulted in a trip out of the hole for bit and motor. The failure occurred on September 16“, 2014 at 1:00 pm CT, at measured depth 18,987 feet. Drilling resumed the following day at 7:45 am CT. The new assembly tracked within zone for nearly one thousand feet before crossing the target’s bottom line. Gamma data seen at the same time once again veriﬁed the projected window’s angle and vertical placement. <br/>On September 17‘”, 2014 at 8:30 pm CT total depth of the Mrachek 21-26H Sidetrack #1 was reached with a measured depth of 20,372’. The wellbore was positioned on the bottom line of an 8 foot target window with a projected true vertical depth of 10,7 38 feet. Despite a strike with the lower Bakken shale and subsequent Sidetrack, the well had been completed in just over 12 days of active drilling. <br/>The Middle Bakken geology consisted of tan to translucent brown dolomite making up the top 1/3 to ‘/2 of the member. Lithology of the lower half steadily increased in detrital sediment, becoming darker in color as sediment amounts increased and was bioturbated. The upper portion of the interval held the stronger shows of petroleum and is evident in the correlation between gas values and percentage of wellbore drilled in zone. The two values increased simultaneously over the second half of the lateral. Petroleum shows of the cuttings were modest at best while gas values seen a steady increase ending with a 350 total gas unit average. <br/>John Nygard Wellsite Geologist </p>

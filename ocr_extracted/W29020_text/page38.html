    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation Mrachek 21-26H is a horizontal well, intended to ﬁirther development of the Bakken formation in the Nameless ﬁeld. The course of the wellbore would track the target zone at an azimuth of 180°. This well is located along state highway 200, 5 miles north west of Alexander, North Dakota in the NE NW Section 26 T151N R102W. The bottom hole coordinates of the Mrachek 21—26H are located 254' FSL & 656' FWL in the SW SW V4 of Section 35 T151N R102W. <br/>This well was spud on September 5‘“, 2014. Well site geological services were started at measured depth of 8,970 feet, within the Charles formation. One hour, ten foot, thirty foot, and ﬁfty foot lagged samples were caught by roughnecks, geologist/mud loggers and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Surface of the well was drilled using salt water brine and a 13.5 inch bit. Casing measuring 9 5/8” in outside diameter was set and cemented at 2,230 feet measured/tme vertical depth. The vertical wellbore, and curve were then both drilled using petroleum based invert mud. An eight and three quarter inch wellbore was drilled to intermediate casing depth and 7” casing was set at 11,129 feet measured depth. The lateral was drilled with a six inch bit using saltwater based drilling ﬂuid. Gas monitoring equipment was provided by Neset Consulting Services, using a Total Gas system. <br/>The Mrachek 21-26H was one of 4 wells drilled sequentially on the same pad. This particular well was drilled to completion prior to the other three which were completed one segment at a time on each well. Spaced 45’ apart at the surface, separation between the vertical wellbores increases along with depth. Despite the separation, lithology and stmctural interpretation of the four wells can be extremely repetitive. This repetitiveness can be increasingly useful in each subsequent well or sequence of a well. This characteristic will also <br/>appear in each wells summary, in particular the vertical and curve portions of the follow accounts. <br/>Vertical wellbore Base of Last Charles Salt 9,259’ MD 9,246 ’ TVD -7,060’ SS <br/>On site logging began September 8'“, 2014 at 6:45 pm CT within the Charles formation. The BLS came in where expected indicating no change to the prognosis target of 10,791 feet, tme vertical depth. Sampled cuttings from the Charles indicated alternating beds of, translucent and blocky salt, limestone, and anhydrite. The base of the last Charles Salt was picked using samples and rate of penetration at 9,246 feet, true vertical depth. Petroleum shows in the Charles were weak as gas ranged from 80 to 100 total units. </p>

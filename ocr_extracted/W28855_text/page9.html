The Frac design will ise a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure; <br/>3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by montioring equipement; <br/>4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flowback than during the frac job; 5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates; <br/>6. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing; <br/>7. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period <br/>  <br/>                        <br/>       <br/>Oasis Petroleum North America LLC 281-404-9436 Address <br/>1001 Fannin, Suite 1500 City Zip Code Houston TX 77002 <br/>- Printed Name 1 Jennifer Swenson Regulatory Assistant October 20, 2014 <br/>Email Address 'swenson oasispetroleum.com <br/>FOR STATE USE ONLY <br/>I I.“ 3,2” By ’- K <br/>Title PETROLEUM ENGINEER ‘ <br/>               </p>

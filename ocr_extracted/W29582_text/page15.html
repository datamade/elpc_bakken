A mud log will be run from Base of Last Salt to TD 5. on all laterals: Mudlog to include: total gas chromatograph and sample cuttings - <br/>10' sample intervals in vertical hole 8. 30' intervals in laterals. A CBUGR log will be run from deepest tree—fall depth in 7 inch casing to surface. An MWD GRIROP log will also be run from KOP (where the CBL will tie into) to T0 of lateral. 2. Open hole logs are not anticipated for this well <br/>3. No DST‘s are planned at this time. <br/>H28 H28 may be present in the Mission Canyon Formation. HZS Trailer will be rigged up prior to penetrating the Mission Canyon through running and cementing the 7"casing Maximum Formation Pressure and Temp 1. Normal tormation pressure gradient is expected (up to 0.5 psi/it or 9.6 ppg) from surface to the Bakken Shale. The Bakken Shale. Bakken Middle Member. and Three Forks may be over pressured up as much as 0.66 psi/ﬂ (12.8 ppg). <br/>2. The maximum anticipated BHST is 260 degrees F. or less. <br/>BOP Equipment Requirements <br/>See attached diagram detailing BOPE speciﬁcations. <br/>1. Rig will be equipped with upper and lower keliy cocks with handles available. <br/>2. inside BOP and TM valves will be available to use on all sizes and threads 0! DP used on well. <br/>3. BOP accumulator will have enough capacity to close HCR valve. close all rams plus annular preventer & retain minimum of 200 psi above precharge on the closing manifold without the use oi closing pumps. The ﬂuid reservoir capacity shall be at least double the usable ﬂuid volume of the accumulatOr system capacity 8- the ﬂuid level shall be mainatained at manufacturer recommendation. There will be 2 additional sources oi power for the closing pumps (electric and air). Sufﬁcient N2 bottles will be available and will be recharged when pressure falls below manufacturer's minimum <br/>4. BOP ram preventers will be tested to 5,000 psi using a test plug when initially installed and alter 7 inch casing is nippled up and at 30 day intervals. Test BOP 8. casing strings to 1.500 psi just prior to drilling out 9-518“ and 7" casing shoes. Function test rams and hydraulically operated remote choke line valve daily (preferably at every crew change). <br/>Page 1 Satter 21X«1C Permit Pkg(11-21-14).xlsx </p>

Based on current information, it is our belief the system can take this gas upon completion of the three wells. <br/>Oxy projects the well completed in the Bakken formation will initially ﬂow 445 barrels of oil and 160 thousand cubic feet of gas per day and the wells completed in the Three Forks/Pronghom formations will initially ﬂow 230 barrels of oil and 90 thousand cubic feet of gas per day. Based on current drilling and completion plans, these wells will be completed in the same timeframe. For the three wells, Oxy projects a peak oil rate of 905 barrels and a peak gas rate of 340 thousand cubic feet per day from the pad. It is anticipated these wells will decline sharply after initial production as do the majority of horizontal wells in the Williston Basin. <br/>Current Flaring <br/>The table below shows gas being ﬂared by Oxy per North Dakota State Industrial Commission’s May 2014 Oil and Gas Production Report. </p>

Below are three alternatives that Oxy considered from a conceptual standpoint to reduce the amount of gas ﬂared. More generally, Oxy is continuing to review the possible impact of implementing one or more of these alternatives as appropriate in our operations. <br/>1) NGL Removal — On Lease </p>

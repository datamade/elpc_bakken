The drilling rig, CanElson #41, began drilling on August 24, 2014 and ceased drilling after the second lateral reached a total depth of 14,194’ on September 14, 2014. The bottom hole locations of laterals l and 2 are located in the NE% NE% and theSE% NE%, respectfully, of Section 33 T152N R92W. Despite the second lateral ending in the SE% NE%, it was referred to as the NESE lateral since its target was in the NE% SE% of section 33. <br/>Holst 2-33MLH landed the curve and drilled laterally within the Middle Member of the Bakken Formation (Early Mississippian) within the Williston Basin. The vertical and curve segments were drilled with an 8%” bit and cased with 7” intermediate casing to a measured depth (MD) of 10,761 ’. The ﬁrst lateral extended another 2,773’ to a total depth of 13,534’. A window was milled through 7” casing at 10,546’ MD for the second lateral which reached a total depth of 14,194’. The laterals were drilled with a 6” bit and cased with 4 1/2” liner. The drilling ﬂuid remained oil based mud for the vertical, curve and lateral segments. </p>

The vertical segment was drilled with an NOV DS616M-01 type bit which was added at 7,728’ MD. The primary off-set well was Holst 1-33H since it was drilled on the same pad as Holst 2-33MLH. The samples collected within the Kibbey Formation were generally described as a light brown to red brown, slightly calcareous, dolomitic shaly siltstone. One sample from the Kibbey Lime was described as a vuggy grainy limestone with traces of anhydrite. Formation gas in the Kibbey Formation averaged 125 units with little variability. A Pason <br/>chromatograph gas detection system was used to monitor gas. The Charles Formation was encountered shortly after logging services began. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The top of the Charles Formation was encountered at 7,903 ’ measured depth (MD) when a relatively massive salt unit, indicative of the Charles top, was encountered. Lithology identiﬁed in the Charles included salt, anhydrite, mudstone, crystalline limestone, and dolomitic limestone. Fast and consistent penetration rates were seen throughout the Charles despite the various changes in lithology. This consistent drilling made it difﬁcult to determine the depths of the 6 salts in the Charles. Drilling signatures such as differential pressure, weight on bit, rotary and torque were useful in determining the depths of the salts with indications of easy drilling. Penetration rates averaged 88fph throughout the Charles Formation but up to 110fph in the salts. Formation gas readings were fairly consistent at about 192 units, however, surges in gas near 230 units were at times detected directly below impermeable evaporate layers. The highest readings were detected at the base of the formation in sandier, more <br/>permeable layers which gave readings above 250 units. The heavier gases were also more prevalent near the Charles base. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">After drilling out of the casing shoe slides were implemented to turn azimuth from about 104° to 898°. A dip calculation early in the lateral yielded a value of 90.82°; however this angle of dip, as expected, steadily increased to 9084" and eventually 90.87° as the lateral turn was being completed. Dip calculations well after the lateral turn showed a decrease in clip with calculations of 90.79°, 90.69”, and 90.55° at the end of the lateral. The wellbore remained in the bottom half of the target window for the majority of the lateral. Drilling near the target base was preferred due to easier drilling and better bit tracking than the inconsistent overlying strata. The wellbore ascended high into the target window around 1 1,850’ MD but the 11’ packstone seen in the curve was not present. The absence of the packstone (shoal) allowed for a structurally low Hot Gamma Marker (target top) and the targets were quickly shifted down to better represent the formation. Near the end of the lateral the bit did not track formation well and slides were more frequent. The decision was made to descend near the target base to hopefully rotate the well out. The bit descended further than planned but it tracked formation slightly better. The average angle of dip in the ﬁrst lateral was 90.72° with a total rise of 39’. The NENE lateral of Holst 2-3 3MLH was completed on September 8, 2014 at 9:15 pm CDT just below the target window at a MD of 13,534', 662.88' FNL & 266.75' FEL of section 33. After running 4” liner a whipstock was placed in the 7” casing at 10,537’ MD to mill a window for the NESE lateral (second lateral). <br/>Lateral #2 NESE 10,546 — 14,194’ MD <br/>The NESE lateral or second lateral began aﬂer milling through 7” casing at 10,546’ MD on September 1 l, 2014 at 4:00 am CDT. The milling bit was replaced at 10,556’ MD for a conventional lateral assembly with a 6” Security MM64 type bit which was used for the remainder of the lateral. The drilling ﬂuid remained oil based mud for the second lateral. Targets were originally projected ahead at 9050 based on early dip calculation from the ﬁrst lateral. Formation dip was also expected to be slightly ﬂatter than the ﬁrst lateral due to drilling further away from the true dip of the formation. <br/>After getting separation from the ﬁrst wellbore slides were implemented for a small lateral turn which increased azimuth from about 111° to 127°. Formation dip was expected to decrease slightly as the wellbore’s azimuth increased towards the strike of the formation but due to indistinctive gamma few dip calculations were made. Formation dip early in the lateral was calculated at 9065" which decreased to 90.6l°. Near the end of the lateral formation dip decreased more signiﬁcantly to 905°. Deﬂections were useful throughout the lateral for determining formation dip due to the lack of distinctive gamma. Near 13,100’ MD the wellbore reached its highest stratigraphic position and a warm gamma stratum was detected which was interpreted as the Hot Gamma Marker (target top). Slides were implemented to descend stratigraphically and drill near the target base where the bit tracked better. The wellbore remained near the target base for the majority of the lateral. The overall formation rise was 40' with an average angle of dip of 90.56°. Holst 2-33MLH is a dual lateral with the NESE lateral as the second and ﬁnal one. The NESE lateral of Holst 2-33MLH was completed on September 14, 2014 at 9:45 pm CDT just below the target center at a MD of 14,194', 2,637.54’ F SL & 259.17’ FEL of Section 33. <br/>Natural gas readings in the Middle Bakken seemed to vary only slightly with changes in stratigraphic position. Formation gas was fairly consistent throughout the lateral with the highest readings detected during periods of down time. Formation gas appeared to increase slightly with increasing depth. Formation gas averaged 610 units in the ﬁrst (NENE) lateral and 420 units in the second (NESE) lateral. The discrepancy is likely due to slower average drill rates in the second (NESE) lateral. The second lateral also drilled nearly parallel to an existing lateral which may also explain the lower gas readings. </p>

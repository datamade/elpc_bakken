PRESSURE CONTROL EQUIPMENT <br/>A. Type: Eleven (11) inch double gate hydraulic BOP with eleven (1 1) inch annular preventer with 5,000 psi Casinghead and 5,000 psi Tubinghead. <br/>B. Testing Procedure: <br/>The annular preventer will be pressure tested to 50% of stack rated working pressure for ten (10) minutes or until provisions of test are met, whichever is longer. The BOP, choke manifold, and related equipment will be pressure tested to approved BOP stack working pressure (if isolated from surface casing by a test plug) or to 70% of surface casing internal yield strength (if BOP is not isolated by a test plug). Pressure will be maintained for ten (10) minutes or until the requirements of the test are met, whichever is longer. At a minimum, the Annular and Blow-Out Preventer pressure tests will be performed: <br/>1. When the BOPE is initially installed; <br/>2. Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken; <br/>3. Following related repairs; and <br/>4. At thirty (30) day intervals. <br/>Annular will be function tested weekly, and pipe & blind rams activated each trip, but not more than once per day. All BOP drills & tests will be recorded in IADC driller's log. <br/>C. Choke Manifold Equipment: All choke lines will be straight lines whenever possible at turns, tee blocks will be used or will be <br/>targeted with running tees, and will be anchored to prevent whip and vibration. <br/>D. Accumulator: Accumulator will have sufﬁcient capacity to open hydraulically-controlled choke line valve (if so equipped), close all rams plus annular preventer, and retain a minimum of 200 psi above precharge on the closing manifold without the use of closing unit pumps. The ﬂuid reservoir capacity will be double accumulator capacity and the ﬂuid level will be maintained at manufacturer's recommendations. Accumulator precharge pressure test will be conducted prior to connecting the <br/>closing unit to the BOP stack. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Miscellaneous Information: <br/>Choke manifold and BOP extension rods with hand wheels will be located outside rig sub-structure. Hydraulic BOP closing unit will be located at least twenty-five (25) feet from the wellhead but readily accessible to the driller. Exact locations and conﬁgurations of the hydraulic BOP closing unit will depend upon the particular rig contracted to drill this hole. <br/>A ﬂare line will be installed after the choke manifold with the discharge point of the ﬂare line to a separate pit located at least 125 feet away from the wellbore and any existing production facilities. </p>

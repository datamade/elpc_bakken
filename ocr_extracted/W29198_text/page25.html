Gas values had been strong since <br/>measured depth 12,000 feet with an average of 1,100 total units and a high mark of 4,800 total units of gas. <br/>The ﬁnal one third of the lateral was completed without any notable changes. The target applied from measured depth 18,500 feet needed to be increased by 01° to 902° over the last 3,000 feet of lateral. Aside from brief cross of the target’s bottom line, the wellbore was held close to center of zone until the end of the lateral. Samples of the second half of the lateral had degraded to a point that they could only be described as if they did or did not resemble the lithology that was expected. <br/>On November 13*, 2014 at 10:30 am CT, total depth of the Mrachek 21-26H was reached with a measured depth of 21,729 feet. The lateral had been completed with the wellbore high to center of an eight foot target window. Samples early on in the lateral were clean tan to off while, occasionally translucent, dolomite within the target zone. This lithology generally produced the most favorable gas and petroleum shows in this lateral as well as the 3 drilled previously in this sequence. The lower extent of zone was indicated by gray siltstone, detrital in origin and typically having weaker petroleum and gas shows. <br/>John Nygard WeIIsite Geologist </p>

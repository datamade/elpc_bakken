Correlations made between the Lodgepole formation top here and other wells indicated a shiﬁ in target. The true vertical depth landing target was lowered 7 feet to 10,795 feet. This value represented a point 18 vertical feet into the middle Bakken. <br/>Curve 10,296’ -— 11,206’ 1WD <br/>Within the Lodgepole formation on October 1st 2014 at 10:00 am CT at measured depth 10,296 feet, the kick oﬁ‘ point was reached. Drilling of the curve segment began at 9:25 pm CT the same day. Lithology of the Lodgepole consisted of light brown to light gray brown, slightly argillaceous, occasionally dolomitic limestone. Petroleum shows of the Lodgepole were scattered and initially weak. Dull to pinpoint ﬂuorescence, and weak cuts improved near the bottom of formation. The same pattern was seen in gas values that peaked at just over 800 total units near formation bottom. The gamma markers of the lower LP were indicating a higher target, closer to the original. Late in the curve it was raised 5 feet to 10,790 feet, true vertical depth. <br/>False Bakken 10, 960’ [MB 10, 747’ TVD -8,561 ’ SS <br/>Consistent with ﬁrst curve landed, a thin proﬁle and high angle when drilled, the False Bakken yielded no sample. It’s top and bottom were determined by gamma data alone. At this depth, gas values increased brieﬂy to almost 900 total units. <br/>Scallion 10,966 ’ MD 10, 749 ’ T VD -8,563 ’ SS <br/>Cuttings recovered at the lagged depth of the Scallion were identiﬁed as pale to light gray limestone with no visible intercrystalline porosity despite streaming petroleum when cut with solvent. Gas values were in a decline with a background of under 600 total units. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 1 0, 985 ’ MD 10, 756 ’ TVD -8,5 70 ’ SS <br/>Blocky, tightly packed, black shale signaled the upper Bakken shortly alter the formation was identiﬁed by gamma data. At a true vertical depth of 10,756 feet, the Bakken top reinforced the late target change of -5 feet. Strong shows of residual petroleum were seen in samples while gas values remained modest at under 600 total units. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,026 ’ MD 10, 770 ’ TVD -8, 584 ’ SS <br/>Samples of tan to light brown, often translucent dolomite veriﬁed entry into the targeted formation member of the Bakken. The clean dolomite was the lithology expected and <br/>represented the upper half the middle Bakken member. Samples possessed good shows of petroleum with dull but solid ﬂuorescence and instant, milky clouds drawn out by added solvent. October 2nd, 2014 at 9:05 pm CT, the end of the curve was reached with a measured depth of </p>

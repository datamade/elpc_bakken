The formation consisted of Limestone: Brown, light brown, cream, tan, dark brown, blocky, packstone, carbonaceous, ﬁrm to brittle, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, eve n dull yellow ﬂuorescence, faint thin streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.78 min/ﬂ and the background gases averaged 55 units. <br/>Lodgepole 10,278'MD 10,276 ' T VD -7,955'SS <br/>The Lodgepole was observed next. The Lodgepole was picked based on sample, and rate of penetration changes. The samples consisted of Limestone: Gray, light gray, gray-tan, gray-brown, light brown, soft in part, ﬁrm to brittle, packstone, slightly argillaceous, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow/green ﬂuorescence, slow thin streaming weak cloudy cut. The decision was made to trip out of the hole and pick up the curve assembly at 10,670' MD on November 8, 2014, around 7:20 pm, CST. Reached bottom and resumed drilling ahead on November 9, 2014 around 2:50 PM. CST. The kick-off point was reached at 10,680' MD on November 9, 2014, around 3:10 PM., CST.

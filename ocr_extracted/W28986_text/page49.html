The Bismarck 6-9H1is a horizontal well targeting the Three Forks Porosity crossing section 9 and 4. The Bismarck 6—9H1 well was spud. on November 4‘”, 2014 and drilling was completed on December 6‘“, 2014. Lateral #1 was drilled to a TD of 21,010’ MD. The surface location was set at 265' FSL & 2,290' FWL, with lateral #1 ending coordinates of 3 17.42’ FSL & 2,658.82' FWL of section 4 and 9,979.58' N-S & 368.82' E—W from the surface location. Joseph Magnan and Dennis Corwin of Neset Consulting Service, provided mudlogging and geological services. beginning on November 7‘“, 2014 in the vertical hole at 9,300’ MD in the Top Charles formation through TD at 21,010’ MD in the Three Forks formation. Norarn Gas Detection Services were utilized throughout the vertical, curve, and horizontal part of the well. Thirty and One Hundred foot lagged samples were caught, washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Sample quality was poor to good during the well. Oil shows were poor to fair while in zone. <br/>Top Charles <br/>Mud logging services began at 9,300’ MD in the Top Charles Formation or. November 7*, 2014 around 9:00 AM., CST. The decision was made to trip out and wire line the MWD tool out at 9,420’ MD around 11:45 AM, on November 7, 2014. Reached bottom and resumed drilling ahead around 11:50 PM on November 7, 2014. The Top Charles samples consisted of Anhydrite: White, off-white, blocky, soﬁ, poor intergranular porosity, trace dolomite light gray, gray, brown, blocky, soﬁ to ﬁrm, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, poor to moderate induration, slightly calcareous, scattered white mineral ﬂuorescence, no cut. Then the samples changed to various thicknesses of Dolomite: Light gray, gray, blocky, soft to ﬁrm, argillaceous, microcrystalline, poor to moderate induration, trace Anhydrite: White, off-white, blocky, soft, poor intergranular porosity, trace light brown limestone, even dull yellow and scattered white mineral ﬂuorescence, no cut. And Limestone: Light brown, brown, blocky, soft to ﬁrm, microcrystalline, carbonaceous, moderate induration, Anhydrite: 20% White, off-white, gray, blocky, soﬁ, poor intergranular porosity, trace light gray dolomite, scattered white ﬂuorescence, no cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.83 min/ﬂ and the background gasses averaged 24 units. <br/>Base ofthe Last Salt 9,471 'MD 9,469' TVD ~7,148' SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was observed next and was picked based on rate of penetration gamma, and sample changes. The Base of the Last Salt samples consisted of Limestone: Brown, light brown, tan, blocky, packstone, carbonaceous, ﬁrm, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered yellow/green ﬂuorescence, faint streaming cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.66 min/ﬂ and the background gas averaged 40 units. </p>

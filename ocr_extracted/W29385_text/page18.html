    <p class="styleSans791.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>yellow ﬂuorescence and thin milky cuts. Drill rates were often near 0.75 minutes/foot. Gas levels averaged between 150 and 200 background units in the upper part of the formation and <br/>around 200 units in the lower Mission Canyon. A peak of 528 units were seen during a connection. <br/>Lodgepole 8, 772 ’ MD 8, 700’ TVD -6, 5 00’ SS <br/>Samples in the Lodgepole were limestone that was well indurated, brittle in part, argillaceous, and gray to light gray in the upper formation and darker gray in the lower portion. Drill rates were between 1.0 and 1.5 minutes/foot while both rotating and sliding. Cuts were often instant thin milky streaming and accompanied by a spotty whitish-yellow ﬂuorescence. <br/>Gas levels were often between 100 and 200 background units and approached 300 units at the formation’s base. <br/>Upper Bakken 9,390' MD 9,274 ' T VD - 7, 052' SS <br/>The Upper Bakken came in 5’ high to prognosis and was composed of black to very dark brown shale that was smooth, well compacted, and blocky. Drill rates were approximately 0.5 <br/>minutes/foot. Fluorescence was an even yellow and cuts were good and broad streaming. Gas levels peaked at 586 units. <br/>Middle Bakken 9,412' MD 9,289' T VD -7,06 7' SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was seen 6’ compared to prognosis and had samples showing gray to light gray dolomite that was microcrystalline, well indurated, and had calcareous cementation. Fluorescence was an even yellow-white, while cuts were fair instant thin streaming. Drill rates <br/>between 0.5 and 1.0 minutes/foot during both slides and rotation. Gas averaged over 250 background units with a peak of 551 units at the formation’s base. <br/>Lower Bakken 9,545 ' MD 9,369' TVD -7,14 7' SS <br/>The Lower Bakken was seen 2 high to prognosis. It was made of black to very dark brown, well compacted shale. The shale had an even yellow ﬂuorescence that was accompanied by good broad streaming cuts. Gas levels averaged roughly 575 units with a peak of 759 near the top. Drill rates were close to l minute/foot. <br/>Three Forks 9,689 ' MD 9,419 ' TVD - 7,197' SS <br/>The Three Forks was seen 4’ high to prognosis. It was comprised of layers alternating between predominantly a tan to opaque tan, microsucrosic dolomite that had calcareous cementation and a pale blue shale that was moderately compacted and smooth. Most samples contained a majority of dolomite. Drill rates varied, but this was largely due to drilling parameters. ROP of 7 5-125 were not uncommon. Gas levels were often between 300-400 background units with connections reaching 600—800 units. A trip mid way through the lateral yielded trip gas of 9270 units. Fluorescence was oﬂen an even or pinpoint yellow and cuts were generally thin and slow. </p>

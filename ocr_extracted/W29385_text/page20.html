    <p class="styleSans792.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>Formation dip continued to hold at 89.3 degrees or steeper for a short time, meaning the wellbore was not actually descending through formation. Additionally, the wellbore deﬂected upwards off of a hard stringer while it was already in the upper portion of the target window. This led to the wellbore exiting the top of the window and possibly getting as close as 5’ TVD to the Pronghorn shale at 12750’ MD. <br/>As a result, the decision was made to use the hot gamma marker at the base of the 15" bench of the Three Forks since using the overlying markers could be unreliable. Inclination was changed to 89.0 degrees to bring the target window down to the l“1 bench. <br/>Samples in this portion of the lateral alternated between predominantly tan dolomite and pale blue shale with slow thin cuts and yellow pinpoint ﬂuorescence. Gas was often near 250 background units with connections could reach 500 units. <br/>The target window was also shifted down 2’ TVD at 13500’ MD in order to reach the 1st bench marker sooner. As these target projections had originally been created, the 89.0 inclination went until 14500’ MD before going back to 89.3 degrees. <br/>The 1St bench marker had still not been encountered by the time the target inclination changed back to 89.3 degrees but since gamma had been relatively low for some time, so it was decided that the wellbore had traversed deep enough into formation for the time being so the 89.0 target was not extended has had been contemplated earlier. <br/>ROP at the midpoint of the later had begun to slow, oﬁen near 75 ft/hr while rotating. Samples were mostly dolomite with small amounts of shale present. Background gas was frequently near 300 units with connections of approximately 500 units. <br/>The 89.0 degree target inclination succeeded in bringing the wellbore to just above the base of the 15‘ bench at around 13900’ MD. Inclination was moved to 89.3 degrees at 14500’ MD. The wellbore remained in the same relative position within the Three Forks for some time with samples being dolomite with trace amount of pale blue shale. <br/>15500’ MD saw the target inclination moved from 89.3 to 89.5 degrees to follow the formation dip that was anticipated based on the structure map created using data obtained from this well thus far and offset wells. This proved to once again be close to formation dip as the wellbore continued to hold in the same region of the Three Forks with samples that were almost entirely dolomite. Cuts were thin and background gas was oﬁen 400-500 background units with connections over 600 units. <br/>An MWD probe failed at 16233’ MD, necessitating a trip out of the hole. It may be noteworthy that trip gas upon returning to bottom reached 9270 units. Drilling resumed at 100+ <br/>ft/hr while rotating. Background gas was oﬁen 300-400 units and connections were still 600-800 units. </p>

    <p class="styleSans791.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>Curve 9, 000’ —— 9,864 ' MD <br/>The curve was begun at 11:45 AM on 10/22/14. The target on the prognosis was 9443’ TVD, though this was changed to 9450’ TVD due to information from surrounding wells. The offset well used for gamma correlation was the Estby 159-94-26A-35-1H as it was the nearest well and was in the adjacent section running parallel to the projected well path of the State. <br/>Markers LPl and 2 gave projected targets of 9436’ and 9438’ TVD, respectively, while markers LP3 and 4 both gave a projected target of 9441’ TVD. LP5 showed a target of 9445’ TVD. This depth was considered acceptable, as the actual target of 9450’ TVD had been intentionally set 5’ low in order to land lower than the center of the target zone with the intention of obtaining a more thorough gamma cross section. <br/>However, the projected target started shifting back upwards, with markers LP6-8 giving projected targets of 9442, 9440, and 9439’ TVD, respectively. Marker LP9 gave a target of 9436’ TVD. At this point, the decision was made to raise the target from 9450’ to 9444’ TVD. <br/>The False Bakken continued this upward-shifting trend, with a target of 9435’. The Upper Bakken shiﬁed back down, with a target of 9439’ and the Middle Bakken gave a projected target of 9438’ TVD. The Lower Bakken shiﬁed down a couple of feet, giving a projected target of 9441 ’ while the Three Forks gave a target of 9439’ TVD once again, so the target was left at 9444’ with the intention of landing a few feet below the ideal target. <br/>The curve was landed at 3:45 PM on 10/23/14 at a depth of 9864’ MD in the Three Forks. <br/>Lateral 9,864 ’ — 19,1 79’ MD <br/>The lateral was begun at 10:00 PM on 10/26/ 14. The initial target inclination was set to 89.5 degrees based on the Estby offset, which was nearly 1/3 mile away but was the closest well. <br/>Drill rates at the start of the lateral were 7 5-100 ft/hr while rotating and samples were 90% dolomite with 10% pale blue shale. Gas was oﬁen around 350 background units. Gamma was in the 50’s when the curve was landed, but climbed back to near 120 api soon after drillout as the wellbore climbed for the ﬁrst couple of hundred feet. The 50’s api gamma was seen again soon after as inclination was brought down. This gave an initial formation dip of 89.1 degrees. <br/>Formation dip was changed ﬁ'om 89.5 to 89.3 in order to slowly traverse downwards through formation and possibly encounter the higher gamma at the base of the 1St bench of the Three Forks. <br/>However, formation dip was actually close to 89.3 degrees for some time, as the wellbore actually moved up a signiﬁcant distance through formation by traversing from the lower to upper portion of the target window that had been given to directional. Gamma had climbed to 110—120 api and was at the upper limit of the desired target area before the wellbore turned back down. </p>

Conduct pre-job safety meeting and review guidelines for Liner Running Procedure with rig crew, casing <br/>crew and company personnel. Ensure that liner running procedure is posted on the rig ﬂoor. Any deviation from procedure requires mutual agreement between onsite supervisor and equipment representative. <br/>Send 4 1/2” casing tally, HWDP, 4 3/4” collars if available, and 4” DP to . Please send all tallies in digital format. Engineer will work through the tally and select placement of tools. <br/>Casing running equipment will be rigged up to run 4-1/2” 13.50 # P110 BTC with downhole equipment and at top of liner. Ensure that all cross-overs are available—if required. <br/>Confirm length, OD and # of swell packers on location. All packers will be “water” reactive swell packers. <br/>Conﬁrm box and pin connections on all liner tools. <br/>2 Centralizers will be run on every swell packer. 1 standard Weatherford 5.875” centralizer above and 1 EZ—Glide 5.875" centralizer below. The upper centralizer may already be included on the box end of the swell packer. <br/>Confirm guide shoe and float equipment. <br/>Ensure the proper PBR (20-ft) is on location. This will be 5 1/4” ID. <br/>Confirm horizontal ball seat and differential pinning pressure of Pressure sleeve at the toe. Sleeve should be pinned at 2,000 psi. <br/>Pick up Lipstick guide shoe with aluminum nose, one joint of 4-1/2”, dual valve float collar, horizontal ball seat, xx joints 4 1/2” 11.6# P-110 BTC, Hydraulic toe sleeve pinned to 2,000 psi, xx joints 4 1/2” 11.6# P110 BTC, first swell packer, and then the remainder of liner with swell packers (each packer is centralized on both ends). See Service Company proposal. All tools and equipment should be callipered prior to going in hole. Review all procedures with Emerald Oil before tripping in hole with liner. <br/>Utilize 4 V2” BTC pump in sub and fill liner with clean, fresh water (probably clean salt water with winter operations) every 750-ft to 1,000—ft while tripping in the hole. Capacity of 4 1/2” 13.5# is 0.0149 bbls/ft. Pick up cross over to 4 1/z” 13.5# P—1 10 BTC, liner hanger/ liner packer with 20-ft PBR and setting tool with the L/D machine. Lift out of the trough using pup joint and dress on the rig floor over the racking boards to lessen risk of broken slio dies fallino down hole. </p>

With setting tool assembly and hanger made up to liner, leave the slips in the rotary bushings and lift the assembly. Do not remove the slips until it is clear that the setting tool is supporting the liner weight. Record liner assembly weight after making up liner hanger with setting tool. This is the weight that will be lost when the setting tool is released. <br/>14. Install drill pipe wiper rubber (outside) to ensure that nothing is dropped in the wellbore. <br/>15. Have hanger company provide 4-1/2” pump-in sub to fill liner. They will also be providing guide shoe and toe circulating sub. Ensure that all float equipment is compatible with connection: 4-1/2” 13.50#I P110 BTC. Liner hanger (or cross-over) must be compatible with BTC. <br/>16. Run in hole on 4” drill pipe. Pick up cross-over (hanger to DP/DC), bumper sub, 21 joints of 4-3/4” DC’s, 15 stands of 4” HWDP and the remainder of the 4” DP. Note: Fill liner and drill pipe every 750’ to 1000’ while going in hole. Limit running speed to 1.5 minutes per stand after hanger is picked up. Enter open hole slowly. <br/>17. Space out top connection of work string so that circulating manifold is no more than 5’ above rig ﬂoor. <br/>18. Rig up Rig Pumps or Service Company pump truck in preparation to set liner hanger and pressure test lines to 7500 psig. <br/>19. Conduct safety meeting and review guidelines for setting liner hanger with all essential personnel. <br/>20. With end of liner at total depth, circulate completion fluid (as per Emerald specifications) to spot across open hole. Completion fluid could also be pumped along with reactive fluid once liner hanger is set and prior to setting liner packer. <br/>  </p>

There will be 2 additional sources of power tor the closing pumps (electric and air). Sufﬁcient N2 bottle. will be available and will be recharged when pressure tells below manutaciurers Minimum <br/>4 BOP rain preventera writ be tested to 5.000 psi for to mining using a test plug (a) vina- initially installed, (b) alter 7 inch casing is nippled up.

A Pit Volume Totalizer Will be installed and the readout will be displayed in the dog house <br/>3 Gas detecting equipment (for a chromatagraph) will be installed at shelter. Readouis will be available in dog nurse and in geologist trailer <br/>4 in the event gas ﬂow becomes an issue, A tiara pit shall be constructed not less than 100‘ from wellhead s 50' from cuttings handling area. Lines to the ﬂare pit will be straight runs (staked dam) and turns wil utilize targeted tees Flare pit will be located down wind as mum as possible. An electronic ignitor will be used along with a propane line to provide for a continuous llare pilot. <br/>     <br/>     <br/>        <br/>Drilling Plan <br/>Section 1 - Surlace Casing» Surface to: 2,420 (Sm-race Casing Depm 4- 20) Conductor: 18" set at 45‘ - 50‘ (depending on gravel or coal depths) Hole Size: 131/2" Mud: Fresh Water <br/>Bits: Tyne 1 mill teeth. 3- B‘DC. 6 1/2‘ DC.

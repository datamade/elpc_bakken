The ROP was approximately 1.93 minutes per foot, and the gaseous hydrocarbons averaged 92 units and with a maximum of 147 units. The typical sample consisted of light to medium gray and medium gray brown, medium brown, cream, very fine to ﬁne grained Siltstone. Samples were poorly to moderately indurated, microsucrosic, slightly argillaceous, subround to subangular ﬁne to very ﬁne sand, poor to fair intergranular porosity, with patchy dull yellow green ﬂuorescence, and a slow cloudy to milky cut that was inﬂuenced by petroleum based <br/>drilling ﬂuid. </p>

The wellbore came out of the shoe approximately 4’ TVD within the target window, with a projected inclination of 89.5 degrees. Initial dip for the 10’ target window was set at 89.8 degrees <br/>Dn'lling within the target window commenced with an exit from the cooler gamma zone in the upper halfof the target window and a tagging of the bottom of the zone. While returning to the center of the zone, gamma repeats prompted a ﬂattening of the formation projection as the wellbore progressing into the up-dip trend which was expected for the first half of the well based upon offset structure data. This up-dip was projected at 90.11 degrees at 13,500’ MD and drilling progressed along dip within the center of the zone, with an approximately 500’ vertical section sweep up into the cooler gamma marker within the upper halfof the target window. At 15,750’ MD gamma changes identiﬁed that the formation had leveled and was moving into the anticipated down—dipping trend that was expected to continue until the well reached total depth. <br/>Apparent dip was set at 89.8 degrees, and as drilling continued, the wellbore dropped inclination beyond the dip rate exited the bottom of the target zone, approximately 4’ TVD, and in efforts to drill back up into zone proved difﬁcult. After bringing the wellbore back to zone where the dip was adjusted at 17,500’ MD to 89.7 degrees. A deﬂection caused the wellbore to be inclined steeply to approximately 4 degrees above dip and the wellbore exited the top of the zone. Signiﬁcant directional work was necessary to bring the wellbore back down in TVD to avoid entering the Lower Bakken Member. These efforts were successful and the dip was held between and 89.8 and 89.7 after gamma repeats suggested an up—dip in the formation that was in conﬂict with the structure and offset well data. At this point, the formation dipped sharply to approximately 89.0 degrees based on a rise of gamma counts to ~170u API and the presence of a moderate very dark gray shale in bottoms up samples suggested contact with the Lower Bakken Member at 20,299’ MD <br/>The rig crew’s efforts to get back on bottom failed, which was suspected to be the result of caving within the wellbore. The drill string was not inundated and able to be tripped out to a suitable sidetrack point further back in the original wellbore. This point was chosen on January 4‘11 at 5:45am CST at 18,603’ MD, which was just prior to the signiﬁcant upward deﬂection earlier in the wellbore. Troughing and time based drilling began at 1:25pm CST later in the day. The trough was effectively drilled, allowing for the sidetrack well to kick off without incident. <br/>Drilling out of the sidetrack trough, the directional team was instructed to bring the wellbore down in TVD and upper zone markers were identified and a significant repeat in the </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Mission Canyon: 7,912' MD 7,910’ T VD -5, 88 7' SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was entered at 7,912’ TVD by sample, and conﬁrmed with a reverse drilling break from .5 min/ﬂ. to 1.1 min/ft. Samples observed contained light tan brown to tan brown carbonaceous limestone with inter-bedded dark laminations. Oil shows in the upper portion of the Mission Canyon revealed light green yellow dull ﬂuorescence and thin to moderate hazy cuts (invert contamination). ROP through the Mission Canyon averaged .45 min/ft. In the upper portion of the Mission Canyon gas averaged 28 units with a peak of 33 units. Samples between 8,100’ MD and 8,200’ MD contained moderate amounts of multi-colored slightly calcareous shale including green, red, and purple and orange. Gas through this area averaged only 29 units and drilled at an average of .50min/ft. This area tended to be a transitional area as samples below consisted of a tan to brown carbonaceous, more dolomitic limestone with even yellow ﬂuorescence. Over-all the Mission canyon measured a total thickness of 618 feet. <br/>Lodgepole: 8,514 ’ MD 8,512’ TVD -6,489’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole formation top was located at 8,512’ TVD as samples transitioned from a brown tan, waxy dolomitic limestone to a light gray to gray argillaceous limestone. A reverse ROP break from .4min/ﬁ. to .7min/ﬁ. was also noted to help conﬁrm. <br/>The upper portion of the Lodgepole consisted of a light to dark gray argillaceous limestone with trace red to black ﬁssile shale observed in samples. Gas averaged 25 units with bump tests performed to insure accuracy. The Upper portion from 8,508’ to 8,831’ averaged .4 min/ft. while rotating. <br/>On November 5, 2014 at 2:40 am, a KOP of 8,831’ MD was reached and a trip out of the hole was made to attach a curve assembly consisting of a 8.75” Hughes T505 bit and Wenze12.38 bend, 7/8 lobe, 5 stage, HR motor. <br/>Drilling resumed on November 4, 2014 at 11:00 PM with a target landing of 9,3 12’ TVD between 80 and 85 degrees. During the construction of the curve, ROP while sliding averaged .65min/ft. Samples from 8,831’ MD to 9,270’ MD were largely the same consisting of an argillaceous gray dolomite with occasional dark laminations. <br/>The Upper and lower Virden markers as well as shale marker 1,2 and 3 were correlated based on the Prognosis and averaged 1 to 3 feet higher. <br/>On November 5, 2014 at 12:00 am a TOOH was made due to a bit failure. The bit was replaced with an 8.75” baker DP 406 bit. The ROP while sliding averaged .65 min/ﬂ. While sliding build rates never ﬁilly achieved the needed build rates of 13 degrees per <br/>100 feet. As the build progressed build rates needed continued to grow calling for a TOOH on November 6, 2014 at 11:45 am at a measured depth of 9,3 79’ MD. </p>

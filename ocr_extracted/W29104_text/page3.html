    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The False Bakken was observed at a measured depth of 9,3 77’ MD (9,267’ TVD) near an inclination of 63 degrees. This was roughly three feet high to the Parshall 403 -3534H, and in line while the raise in TVD to 9,309 feet. The False Bakken was identiﬁed with samples changing over from a gray dolomitic limestone to a black to dark brown greasy non-calcareous shale with blooming yellow green cuts and dull orange brown ﬂuorescence. Gas at this time rose to 207 units from 25 units. Gamma conﬁrmed the False Bakken with a rise in API from 34 to a peak of 115 API. The False Bakken Measured twelve feet thick and was exited at 9,401’MD (9,278’ TVD) with an inclination of 65.5 degrees <br/>The Scallion was noted at 9,401’ MD (TVD 9,278) as samples changed over to a tan gray to tan dolomitic limestone. Gamma recorded a drop from 109 API to a low of 29 API. The Scallion recorded a total thickness of fourteen feet, and was exited at an inclination of 64 degrees. <br/>Upper Bakken 9,442 ’MD 9,292 'TVD - 7,269 'SS <br/>Entering the Upper Bakken Shale at 74 degrees at 9,442’ MD with a TVD of 9,292’ Gamma rose to peak of 342 API from 33 API. Gas increased to 219 units. Samples in the Upper Bakken consisted of greasy black non calcareous brittle, ﬁssile, shale with oil shows consisting of even dull yellow brown ﬂuorescence and instant milky yellow brown cuts. Gas averaged 230 units as the Upper Bakken was penetrated. An exit of the shale was made at 9,501’ MD with a TVD of 9,307’ at 74 degrees based on sample, and 9,510’ MD (TVD 9,310’) by gamma, for a wellbore exposure of 48 feet and a total thickness of <br/>18-20 feet. During the landing the Upper Bakken Shale came in roughly on prognosis. <br/>Middle Bakken 9, 51 0 ’MD 9,31 0' T VD - 7,289 ’SS <br/>Bottoms up was circulated to conﬁrm an entry into the Middle Bakken. Samples consisted of 30% light gray arenaceous dolomite with inter—bedded chert, and 70% dolomite. On November 7, 2014 at 4:38 am a curve landing was reached at 9,503’ MD at a TVD of 9,306.5 est. and an inclination of 77 degrees. Upon returning to bottom the actual inclination at survey was 74 degrees with and TVD of 9,308’. Throughout the Middle Bakken a sub rounded to sub angular dolomite was observed with the center portion grading unconsolidated with good inter-granular porosity and oil observed over the shakers. The Upper portion near the hot gamma marker showed to be slightly more argillaceous and consisting of a gray to light gray color. When the Lower portion of the </p>

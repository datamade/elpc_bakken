Targeting petroleum and natural gas reserves of the middle Bakken formation, this well furthers development of the Timber Creek ﬁeld within the Williston Basin. The Rovelstad 21-13-3H was drilled sequentially along with the Rovelstad 21-13HU upon the same location, poisoned near the northern boundary of section 13 T150N R100W. The two wells were spud on November 25‘h and 26‘“, 2014 respectively. The wells were designed to tracked formation laterally with a heading of 180° due south for approximately 10,000 feet. A 13.5 inch surface hole was drilled and cased to a depth of 2,328 feet before the Pioneer 77 drilling rig moved directly north 45 feet to the Rovelstad 21-13HU. That well would be drilled to completion of its curve segment before the rig returned to the Rovelstad 21-13-3H on December 3rd, 2014. </p>

Lagged samples were caught by geologist/mud loggers, and roughnecks, cleaned, reviewed under microscope and described for reference on the mud log. One set of clean, dry samples were preserved for the archives at The North Dakota Geological Survey's Wilson M. Laird Core and Sample Library on the University of North Dakota campus in Grand Forks. <br/>Vertical Wellbore </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">On December 6‘“, 2014 the wellbore had reached a measured depth of 9,320 feet and logging began at 6:35 pm CT. As the second of the two vertical/curve segments to be drilled, determining the landing target was aided by formation measurements taken while drilling the Rovelstad 21-13HU. Using that data, the landing target was immediately lowered 8 feet to 11,171 feet true vertical depth. As expected, the two vertical wellbores shared nearly identical lithology within their vertical segments. The similarity is attributed to their close proximity to one another and is also reﬂected in their respective lithological descriptions here within. <br/>Base of Last Charles Salt 9, 61 0’ MD 9,606 ’ TVD - 7,278 ’ SS </p>

The interval of anhydrite and limy gray shale was seen immediately above a thick bed of salt, underline by a similar limy, shale. Following that at roughly 50 feet thick, the Base of the Last Charles Salt came in at a measured depth of 9,610 feet and true vertical depth of 9,606 feet. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The False Bakken shale and underlying Scallion were not captured in sample and identiﬁed only with gamma data at measured depth 11,240 feet and a true vertical depth of 11,130 feet. The mix of limestone and shale drill cuttings returning from this approximate lagged depth had strong petroleum shows with bright ﬂuorescence and fast streaming cuts. Background gas values roughly doubled to an average of 450 total units. The vertical position of the False Bald(en indicated the landing target was 3 more feet lower than the twice adjusted target of 1 1,175 feet true vertical depth. <br/>Upper Bakken 11,270’ MD 11,142’ TVD -8,814’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Bakken formation was penetrated at 11,270 feet measured depth and 11,142 feet true vertical depth. The upper shale was initially identiﬁed with an increased penetration rate followed by a sharp increase in gamma values and eventually veriﬁed in sample. The cuttings of the upper shale were a very dark brown to black, slightly calcareous shale with no indication of porosity or permeability. Distinct hydrocarbon shows, primarily at its top and bottom contacts were present in the form of ﬂuorescence and cut. Gas readings in the shale were the strongest recorded in the vertical/curve section of the well, peaking at just over 3,300 total units of gas. </p>

Initial samples of the middle member began with Tan to pale brown, translucent dolomite with rare inclusions of detrital sediment. All middle Bakken samples caught while landing the curve included black shale from the overlying Bakken shale that continued to slough off Approaching the target depth and lowering into zone samples became darker in color, <br/>a ﬁinction of the increasing amount of clastic inclusions and bioturbation in the dolomitic Bakken member. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">On December 8*, 2014 at 7:00 am CT the end of curve was reached at a measured depth of 11,485 feet, and a projected true vertical depth of 11,173 feet, slightly high to center within the middle Bakken. The curve was completed after 7.7 hours of “on bottom/bit” time. At 11 vertical feet below the upper Bakken shale the wellbore was positioned at the top of an 8 foot target window that would be applied for the lateral leg of the well. On site geology and Geosteering services would resume aﬁer casing had been set, cemented and lateral drilling ready to begin. </p>

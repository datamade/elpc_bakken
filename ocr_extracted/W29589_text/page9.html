Sum all the individual well “Theoretical Montth Gas Production” volumes to determine the “Mal Theoretical Montth Gas Production" for the central production facility. Calculate a sales factor by dividing the total “Actual Montth Gas Sales” by the “Total Theoretical Montth Gas Production” volumes for the central production facility corrected as necessary for any time well was producing but measurement was not operational. Determine “Allocated Montth Gas Sales” for each well by multiplying the respective individual well “Theoretical Montth Gas Production” volume by the sales factor calculated in step (e) above. <br/>Gas Sales meter used in the measurement will be calibrated and maintained according to gas gathering contracts with commercial gathering entities and/or industry standard practices if performed by EOG Resources directly. <br/>Well gas allocation meters will be checked and calibrated on a standard timespan reflective of gas volume magnitude (large volumes quarterly, lower volumes every 6 months. <br/>Volumes will be reported to appropriate agencies through routine gas production reports ﬁled monthly. </p>

This reflects that for similar crude oils gas volumes in solution within “saturated separator barrels” leaving treaters is primarily a function of separation “ﬂash” conditions and not producing GOR from the well. The coriolis meters at the treaters will be measuring “saturated” separator barrels containing the soon to be liberated tank gas vapor still in solution before finally ﬂashing at tank conditions. </p>

    <p class="styleSans791.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>GEOLOGIC SUMMARY <br/>The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation Tarpon Federal 44-19-3RTF is a Sand Creek ﬁeld well located in the SESE of Section 19 T153N R96W in McKenzie County, North Dakota, with primary interest in Cycle 1 of the Three Forks Formation The Tarpon Federal 44-19-3RTF spud September 19, 2014 and reached a total depth of 20,280’MD on October 3, 2014. Wellsite geological services began at 7,350 feet just above the Tyler formation. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota and at Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation in Denver, Colorado. <br/>Vertical 7,350’ — 10, 990’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 7,350 feet measured depth in The Tyler Formation. Gas detection system was recalibrated and tested before logging depth with system functioning correctly. Drill rates averaged 1.09 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 11 to 8121 total units. <br/>Tyler 7,445 ’ MD 7,442’ T VD 5,243’ SS <br/>The Tyler formation was encountered at 7,445’ MD; 5,243’ SS. The lithology throughout the Tyler formation was very diverse, ranging from dolomitic sandstone, to shale beds with siltstone lenses, to an argillaeeous limestone with abundant anhydrite stringers. Drill rates were inconsistent with background gas averaging 350 units. <br/>Kibbey Limestone 8, 054’ MD 8,051 ’ T VD 5,852’ SS <br/>The Kibbey Limestone was encountered at 8,054’ MD; 5,852’ SS. The Kibbey Lime was picked by the change in sample to a lighter brown red limestone with abundant silt and anhydrite content. Samples progressed in oxidation and became a more pronounced rust red brown with interbedded siltstones. <br/>Charles 8,213 ’ MD 8,210’ TVD 6,011 ’ SS <br/>The Charles formation was encountered at 8,213’ MD; 6,011’ SS. . The gray limestone package contained a variety of layers of limestone grading into salt beds with abundant anhydrite stringers and beds. The limestone lying underneath the salt and anhydrite beds often contained a fair amount of rhombic dolomite crystals. These areas often slowed ROP rates. </p>

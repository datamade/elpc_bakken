Base of the last salt was picked by the last sample with salt present, this was accompanied by an increase in ROP and an increase in gamma ray activity, visible on Pason EDR. The rig auto driller was set to 100 feet per hour through the salt in order to help ease fall in from the brittle salt. The salt was opaque to off white in color, brittle, subangular, and massive Samples then became beds of limestone and occasional anhydrite lenses until the Mission Canyon. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,144 ’ MD 9,141 ’ TVD 6, 942’ SS <br/>Mission Canyon was picked based on correlating gamma activity with an offset log. ROP averaged 1.25 minutes a foot. Samples consisted of a mottled limestone, light grey—brown to cream, ﬁrm, micro to very ﬁne crystalline, no visible intercrystalline porosity, abundant anhydrite, trace dark brown to olive green oil stain, scattered to even yellow ﬂuorescence, fast yellow—green milky cut, to a faint blue yellow cut. Gas ranged from 256 to 2068 total units in the Mission Canyon. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The top of the Lodgepole was picked at 9,759’ MD using the gamma marker and a slight sample change, as well as a change in both differential pressure and torque, which was visible on the Pason EDR scree. Drill rates in the Lodgepole averaged 1.2 minutes per foot rotating. Samples were primarily limestone, light to medium gray brown, medium to dark gray, poor to no visible porosity, pinpoint yellow ﬂuorescence with thin streaming cuts. KOP was reached at 10,200’ MD. Gas ranged from 124 to 750 total units. <br/>False Bakken 10,567’1WD 10,511 ’ TVD 8,312’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was Visualized at 10,567’ MD, 10,511’ TVD. The False Bakken was picked by the large spike in gamma at the base of the Lodgepole. Samples of limestone became much darker and argillaceous in this zone. <br/>Scallion 10,5 72 ’ MD 10,513 ’ T VD 8,314’ SS </p>

Samples consisted of a dark gray limestone with abundant argillaceous laminations. Gas activity throughout the Scallion would reach a maximum of 8121 units at a MD of 10,576. The tops of the False Bakken and the Scallion would help solidify our target landing of 10,163’ TVD. </p>

I <br/>l/ Surface Casing: 9 5/8" 36# .l-55 set to a depth below surface aquifers 2,410 ﬂ. (Pb =3520 psi, Pc=2020 psi). Intermediate Casing: 7" 29# P-l IO LT&C casing (Pb: I 1,220 psi, Pc :85 lo psi) run to just above the salt <br/>intervals (surface to 7,248 0); and 7” 32# P-l l0 LT&C (Pb: 12,460 psi, Pc: 10,760 psi) from above the salt intervals to the horizontal in the Middle Bakken interval (7,248 to 11,556 ft). <br/>Uncemented Liner: 4%" l 1.61% P-l lO BTC (Pb: l0,690 psi, Pc=7560 psi) set from above KOP to the end of the lateral (10,706 to 20,841 it). <br/>Liner hanger plan to set at approximately [00’ above [SOP at IQ,706’ (in the upper Lgdgepole Fm). <br/>A Polished Bore Receptacle is run above the liner hangar. <br/>The completion method is Plug and Perf; with one sliding sleeve in the toe stage. Plan for 35 swell packers. Plan spacing is 265’ per stage. <br/>Two 10,000 psi frac valves are set on the wellhead; typically both are 7- Ill 6” bore valves with the upper valve being remotely hydraulically operated. <br/>Stimulation: <br/>i e h draulic ur eatment will be ert‘ rmed thr int edi casin strin . Typical rates are 40 to 70 bpm; with average wellhead treating pressures of 6800 to 7800 psi. <br/>Pressure Rating: The wellhead and intermediate casing string are pressure tested per state testing requirements at 9500 psi. The ending pressure after 30 minutes (provided, per state regulations, that it is no less than 5% below the initial test pressure) is then set at the maximum fracture treating pressure. Pop-off valves are set no more than IOO psi below this pressure; with pump kick-outs staggered over a 300 psi interval below the pop-off setpoint. <br/>Per state requirements a ﬂow line is run from the surface casing valve (connected to the surfaceintermediatc casing annulus) to a ﬂowback tank. An electronic pressure gauge is mounted on this line and the pressure data continuously displayed and recorded throughout pumping operations. </p>

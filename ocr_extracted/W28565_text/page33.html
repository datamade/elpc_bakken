    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Wiley 4-25H2 was drilled as a single lateral horizontal well on an eight well Eco—pad in Section 25 T150N, R97W and ending in Section 36 T150N R97W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The target formation was the Three Forks 2nd Bench. The surface location was set at 775’ FNL & 1,685’ FEL in Section 25 and had ending coordinates of 238.89' FSL & 1,602.81' FEL of section 36. Drilling began on December 27, 2014 and the well was paused from January 4 to January 20, 2015 to drill other wells on the pad. Aﬁer drilling resumed a TD of 20,284’ MD was reached at 9:45 am CT on January 28, 2015. <br/>Wellsite geological services consisted of two mudloggers. A Noram gas detecting <br/>system with chromatograph was utilized. Samples were caught at 30’ intervals from 8,515’ to TD of 20,284’ MD All samples were saved and boxed to be sent to the State of North Dakota. <br/>Charles 8,515’ MD 8,514 ’ T VD -6,241 ’ SS <br/>The Charles formation was picked off sample and drilling change. The Charles formation was salt, translucent, white, milky white, hard, brittle in part, massive, with intermittent stringers of anhydrite, white, light gray, amorphous, soﬁ. At approximately 7,523’ samples changed to limestone, light brown, tan, yellow brown, cream, crypto to microcrystalline, moderate to very calcareous, slightly argillaceous, ﬁrm to slightly soﬁ, dolomitic in part, with frequent beds of salt observed. Aﬁer the Base Last at 9,156’ MD, 9,155’ TVD (-6,882’ SS) samples returned to limestone, brown, dark brown, gray brown, crypto to microcrystalline, fossiliferous at times, very to moderately calcareous, argillaceous at times, ﬁrm to slightly soﬁ, very dolomitic at times. Intervals of very poor intergranular porosity were observed and very slow streaming ﬂuorescing cuts at times. Gas ranged from 12 to 41 units. The top of the Charles came in with prognosis while the Base Last Salt both came in 2’ low. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,3 71 ’ MD 9,3 70’ T VD - 7, 097’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was picked off sample and drilling change and was limestone, dark brown, brown, minor light brown, microcrystalline, calcitic at times, moderately calcareous, moderately argillaceous, silty, ﬁrm to slightly hard, dolomitic at times, with intervals of poor intergranular porosity observed and very slow to fast streaming ﬂuorescing cuts at times. Gas ranged from 10 to 43 units. The Mission Canyon came in 2’ low to prognosis. <br/>Lodgepole 9, 929 ’ MD 9, 928’ TVD - 7, 655 ’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole formation was picked off sample and drilling change. Samples were limestone, brown, light brown, gray brown, cream, tan, crypto to microcrystalline, </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">slightly calcareous, predominately microsucrosic, earthy at times, friable to ﬁrm, scattered pale greenish gray shale, scattered dark brown oil staining, poor intercrystalline porosity, scattered to abundant pale yellow green ﬂuorescence, with weak fluorescing cuts. Gas ranged from 40 to 222 units with connection gases ranging from 125 to 199 units. The Three Forks came in 1’ high to prognosis. The curve was drilled to 11,203’ MD on January 2, 2015. Casing was set at 11,187’ MD, 10,935.28’ TVD and 438.27’ VS. BHL ofcasing was 1,213.25’ FNL & 1,678.36’ FEL in Sec 25, T150N, and R97W. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Casing was exited on January 22, 2015 at 11:50 am CT. Casing was set approximately 12’ into the Three Forks. The planned target was an 18’ window, with emphasis put on a 7’ window within target marked by hot gamma markers to aid in steering. Drilling began with the bit just inside this 7’ window giving us a good starting reference. Drilling went on with good control and the bottom marker of the 7’ window was concentrated on for the remainder of the lateral. <br/>From drilling out of casing until approximately 17,700’ MD, steering went very well with markers being consistent and reliable. Aﬁer this point, there appeared to be a change in the gamma signature, with the clean readings between our hot markers having pinched out. Hot markers also appeared to have changed making it somewhat harder to steer but still readable with an apparent change in dip over the last 2,500’ of the lateral. Through this change in gamma signature a slowdown in ROP was also observed. Torque/hole drag was higher and with gamma changes a suspected change in lithology was likely a contributor to the slowdown. Samples were of no use to verify due to heavy contamination from lube sweeps and poor returns over the shakers. The lateral was <br/>drilled to a TD of 20,284’ MD at 9:45 am CT on January 28, 2015 and had a BHL of 238.89' FSL & 1,602.81' FEL, Section 36 T150N R97W. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The lateral showed low gas readings out of casing and throughout the well. At approximately 17,000’ MD a sudden increase was seen and circulation was put through the gas buster. No ﬂare was observed and an increase in C5 was seen, indicating the gas was mostly a result in the increase of lube sweeps. There were no oil shows observed through the lateral and water weights were maintained at 9.7 to 9.9 pounds. There was one trip made to wireline the MWD tool at 16,117’ MD that produced 462 units of trip gas and no oil shows. Refer to Cross Section on page 19 to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. </p>

North Dakota <br/>Due to weather delays and recent road closures in Divide County, Playtex seeks an extension of the APD as the Precision 607 rig is scheduled to arrive at the location on/around mm 2011 and will not spud surface casing until on/around August 6, past the current expiry date. <br/>Further, attiant conﬁrms that the subject location is adjacent to an existing OneOK gas gathering line (Baytex B9) which is fully operational and gathering gas from other Baytex wells in the vicinity. Baytex anticipates that provided the subject well meets contract speciﬁcations (H28), the Nelson 7-6 well will be connected to gas sales within thirty days of well completion. In lieu of a gas capture plan, we attach an updated gas gathering map depicting the subject well location along with full details on the current OneOK system servicing the Baytex leasehold in Divide County, North Dakota. <br/>In accordanc: with the stipulations for multi-well drilling pads, aﬁ'tant afﬁrms that a fully executed surface use agreement for the Surface Location, Subsurface, Roadway and Pipeline easement has been signed & executed by the surface owner of record. The surface owner has agreed to the drilling of this well both on a multi-well pad and into an oﬁ'eite spacing unit. Afﬁant aﬁirms that a valid oil, gas & mineral lease exists which covers both the surface & mineral estates and this landowner for the surface location has executed a surface damage agreement covering both spacing units. No drill cuttings will be buried at this multi-well site which has the existing Nelson 18-19-161-98H lBP (W26087) well at this surface location. <br/>Whereas, Randy M. Verret does aﬁ'mn that he is responsible for the content herein and is the applicant’s representative to contact by mail at Baytex Energy USA LTD, 600 17‘h Street, Suite 16003. Denver.

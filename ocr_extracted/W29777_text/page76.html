    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">wellbore continued to slowly build in TVD but would lose inclination in rotary. Directional continued to put twenty to thirty foot slides in and the wellbore continued to build in TVD reaching the cooler gamma about one to two feet below the target window. At a MD of 17,000’ the C faces was encountered making the new calculated dip 90.15 degrees. As the wellbore reached this point it began to roll over at around 89 degrees. At 17,262’ MD drilling was stopped to run a Gyro tool to survey the wellbore position before starting the directional turn for well avoidance between the existing Arnegard #2126H and the Lucky Lady wells. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 250 —- 300 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 80 - 100 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 350 — 500 units with connection gases reaching as high as 718 units. The samples seen in the lower portion of the Middle Bakken continued to exhibit a cream gray tan/cream tan dolomite with traces of limestone and siltstone present and an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence. <br/>Day 4 1 7,262’ — 19,460’ MD <br/>After running the Gyro tool throughout the well the wireline was rigged down and drilling resumed with the S lateral. After getting the surveys back from Gyrodata the wellbore position dropped about four feet in TVD. The target window throughout the lateral was adjusted to reﬂect this and drilling continued with slides done to work on well avoidance and to keep the wellbore slightly above dip to continue building in TVD back into the Middle Bakken target window. The wellbore began to build rapidly in TVD into and through the target window at 91 — 92 degrees. As the top of the target window was exited and the A faces gamma was seen slides were done and the wellbore was leveled out about four to ﬁve feet down from the Upper Bakken Shale. The wellbore continued to drop in TVD back into and through the target interval seeing the A to C transition and the warm gamma ﬁ'om the D faces. Slides were done again and the wellbore was leveled out about six feet below the target window. The wellbore began to build in rotary entering the target window and continuing towards the top of the target interval. As the upper portion of the target was reached the A faces was seen indicating that the formation had ﬂattened to 90.12 degrees. After putting in a twenty ﬁve foot down slide the wellbore leveled out and began dropping slowly around 895 degrees towards the top of the target window. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 250 - 300 ﬂ/hr while rotating and around 80 - 100 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 250 — 500 units while running through the gas buster with an occasional small ﬂare seen while drilling. The samples seen in the upper portion of the formation exhibited a cream tan/light to medium tan dolomite with traces of limestone and siltstone present and an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Day 5 19, 460’ — 20,284’ MD <br/>Drilling continued today with slides done to work on leveling the wellbore out above the target interval. As the wellbore began to head down section the upper clean from the C transition was seen putting the calculated dip at 90.2 deg. The wellbore continued to drop through the target interval and exited the base of the Middle Bakken target interval seeing the C to D faces transition and continued to head down section at </p>

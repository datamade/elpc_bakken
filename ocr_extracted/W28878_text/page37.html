Gamma also spiked, reaching as high as 703 API. Background gas ranged from 168 to 786 units, averaging 505 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.35 to 0.77 minutes per foot, averaging 0.45 minutes per foot. The upper Bakken was described as black carbonaceous shale with no visible porosity and a bright fast streaming cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 1 0,1 6 7’ 1WD 10,099’ T VD -7,807’ SS <br/>The top of the Middle Bakken was picked at a decrease in rate of penetration and gamma. The ﬁrst sample caught in the Middle Bakken was described as cream gray dolomite with fair to good porosity. Samples transitioned to a medium gray sandstone with poor porosity and a cloudy green fair streaming cut. Rate of penetration in the Middle Bakken ranged from 0.52 to 1.22 minutes per foot, averaging 0.80 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged ﬁ'om 163 to 516 units, averaging 334 units. Gamma ranged from 42 to 250 API, averaging 90 API. <br/>Lower Bakken 10,283’ AID 10,156’ T VD -7,864’ SS <br/>The top of the Lower Bakken Shale was picked at an increase in rate of penetration and gamma. Sample changed from sandstone to black shale. Gamma peaked at 882 API and averaged 629 API. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.37 to 1.03 minutes per foot and averaged 0.55 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 51 to 741 units and averaged 419 units. <br/>Three Forks 10,356’ MD 10,183’ TVD -7,891 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Three Forks was picked at a decrease in rate of penetration and gamma, as well as a change in sample from black shale to medium gray siltstone. Rate of penetration in the Three Forks while drilling the curve ranged from 0.53 to 1.37 minutes per foot and averaged 0.85 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 90 to 544 units and averaged 409 units. Gamma ranged from 67 to 181 API and averaged 104 API. Initially samples were light medium gray siltstone with overall poor porosity. Samples had a good yellow green good streaming cut. Samples quickly transitioned to a gray tan sandstone with fair to poor porosity. Intermediate casing point was reached at 10,456’ measured depth on November 2, 2014 at 4:00 pm. Projection to bit put the wellbore at the target TVD of 10,190’ TVD at 89.75 degrees. <br/>Lateral 10,456’ — 20, 748’ <br/>After intermediate 7” casing was successfully ran and set to 10,437’ measured depth, drilling began in the lateral at 7:00 am on November 4, 2014. No notable trip gas. The top of the 9’ target window is set 11’ below the base of the lower Bakken shale. There is a clean gamma contact at the top and the base of the target window. The top contact point averages about 68 API. The base of the target window is at a clean gamma contact point averaging about 56 API. Gamma ranged ﬁ'om 74 to 131 API and averaged 106 API between the two clean contact points found at the base and the top. </p>

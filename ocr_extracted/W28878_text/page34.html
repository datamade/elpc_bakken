The Solberg 21-2TFH is a horizontal well with the two mile lateral across sections 2 and 11, targeting the Three Forks. Bottom hole location is in the SESW of Section 11 T156N R97W. The Solberg 21-2TFH was spudded October 28, 2014 at 12:30 am and reached a total measured depth of 20,748’ on November 8, 2014 at 11:05 pm. Wellsite geological services provided by Jessica Stark and Jennifer Meidinger of Neset Consulting Service began at 7,200’. A Total Gas Detection system was utilized for gas analysis. Samples were caught every thirty feet throughout the vertical and curve and every ﬁfty feet throughout the lateral, as well as intermediate samples when necessary. One set of samples was washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 7,200’ — 9, 790’ 1WD <br/>Logging services began at 7,200’ measured depth in the lower Amsden at 7:00 pm <br/>on October 30‘”, 2014. The lower Amsden consisted of red orange dolomitic siltstone and brick red shale. <br/>Tyler 7,233’ MD 7,228’ TVD -4, 936’ SS <br/>The top of the Tyler marker was picked using gamma. The Tyler came in 9’ high to the prognosis. The ﬁrst sample in the Tyler was a red siltstone with poor porosity. As drilling continued the samples transitioned to a brick red ﬁssile shale. Overall the Tyler had poor porosity and little oil shows. Total gas ranged from 56 to 140 units and <br/>averaged 67 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.23 to 1.97 minutes per foot and averaged 0.58 minutes per foot. <br/>Kibbey Lime 7, 780’ MD 7, 775’ TVD -5,483 ’ SS <br/>The Kibbey Lime was picked at a drop in gamma and the sample change ﬁom a reddish sandstone to a cream gray limestone. The Kibbey came in 13’ low to the prognosis. <br/>Charles 7,938’ MD 7, 933’ TVD -5, 641 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Charles was picked using sample and gamma. The Charles came in 20’ low to the prognosis. Samples changed from red orange sandstone to salt. A total of three salt beds, along with beds of dolomite, anhydrite, and limestone, were encountered in the Charles formation. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.20 to 2.13 minutes per foot </p>

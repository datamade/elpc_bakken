Purchaser capacity is expected to be sufficient for the volumes produced from these wells. In the event that electric power is required on-site, a natural gas powered generator will be evaluated. Installation of a liquid stripping plant to be utilized in the event of upset conditions would not be economic. Such an installation will be re-evaluated as additional wells are completed and if conditions change. <br/>6b. A natural gas powered generator could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 60-80 MCFD. A liquid stripping plant could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 40%. On lease gas use by Heater/Treaters will consume approximately 30 MCFD </p>

Field gas is gathered and transported through the system to Hiland Partners' Watford City Plant (Sec. 6-151N-102W) for processing. The system has interconnections to allow offloading excess gas volumes to Hess’ Tioga plant (Sec. 26-157N—95W) and to OneOK’s Stateline plant (Sec. 21—155N—103W). <br/>See attached plats. <br/>Gathering Segment Name: WC-Egging — Lakeside Gathering System <br/>33. 3b. 3c. 3d. 3e. <br/>Maximum Current Capacity ofGathering Segment: 55 000 MCFD <br/>Current Throughput of Gathering Segment: 33 000 MCFD <br/>Anticipated Capacity of Gathering Segment At lP Date: 60 500 MCFD <br/>Anticipated Throughput of Gathering Segment At lP Date: SSIOOO MCFD (including these wells) Issues or Expansion Plans: Hiland plans to install additional compression and line loops priorto initial production from these wells. <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  </p>

In the event that electric power is required on-site, a natural gas powered generator will be evaluated. Installation of a liquid stripping plant to be utilized in the event of upset conditions would not be economic. Such an installation will be re—evaluated as additional wells are completed and if conditions change. <br/>A natural gas powered generator could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 30—40 MCFD. A liquid stripping plant could be expected to reduce ﬂare volumes by approximately 40%. On lease gas use by Heater/Treaters will consume approximately 15 MCFD </p>

Sum all the individual well "Theoretical Monthly Gas Production" volumes to determine the ‘Total Theoretical Monthly Gas Production" for the central production facility. Calculate a sales factor by dividing the total "Actual Monthly Gas Sales" by the "Total Theoretical Monthly Gas Production" volumes for the central production facility corrected as necessary for any time well was producing but metering was not operational. Determine "Allocated Monthly Gas Sales" for each well by multiplying the respective individual well "Theoretical Monthly Gas Production" volume by the sales factor calculated in step (5) above. Gas Sales meter used will be calibrated and maintained according to gas gathering contracts with commercial gathering entities and/or industry standard practices if performed by Emerald directly. Well gas allocation meters will be checked and calibrated on a standard times span reflective of gas volume magnitude (large volumes quarterly, lower volumes every 6 months. <br/>Volumes will be reported to appropriate agencies through routine gas production reports filed monthly. <br/>Associated Oil Tank Gas (aka. Vapors) Recovered And Sold With Separator Gas: <br/>If central facility separator gas is 1) active 0n gas sales system and Z) vapor recovery is required for emissions compliance and/or vapor recovery otherwise economic then a Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU) will be installed to recover tank gas prior to entry into atmospheric tanks. <br/>1. <br/>Commingled gas from the discharge of Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU) compressors will be metered and allocated back to the individual wells based upon each well prorated share of continuously metered oil volumes from the treater Coriolis meters and not producing well stream GOR. This reflects that for similar crude oils gas volumes in solution within "saturated separator barrels'I leaving treaters is primarily a function of separation "flash" conditions and not producing GOR from the well. The coriolis meters at the treaters will be measuring "saturated" separator <br/>barrels containing the soon to be liberated tank gas vapor still in solution before finally flashing at tank conditions. </p>

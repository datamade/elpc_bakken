Based on full casing evacuation with 9.5 ppg ﬂuid on backside @ 10,990’ TVD. 2. Burst pressure based on 9,000 psi Stimulation pressure with 10 ppg internal ﬂuid gradient with 9.0 ppg gradient <br/>on backside @ 10.990’ TVD. 3. Based on string weight in 9.5 ppg fluid (Buoyed weight: 120k lbs.) plus 100k lbs over pull. <br/>5. MUD PROGRAM <br/>Sufficient materials/inventory will be on location at all times to maintain mud properties, control lost circulation and maintain well control. The table below summarizes the visually monitored mud systems proposed for this program. <br/>mm- <br/>During use of Oil Based Mud: 0 Clean pits and insure doors do not leak. 0 install wash down gun and diesel bucket at shakers. Secure all water lines. o Rig up mud bucket and wiper rubbers on floor. 0 Change centrifugal pump packing lubricant from water to grease. 0 Provide absorbent material for stairs, walkways and rig ﬂoors. <br/>                <br/>    <br/>Anticipated mud weights are based on actual offset well bottom hole pressure data plus trip margins. Mud weights utilized may be somewhat higher to allow for trip margin and to provide hole stability for running logs and casing. <br/>Visual mud monitoring equipment will be utilized. 6. EVALUATION PROGRAM <br/>Logs: Logging Waiver requested based on the “Dudley Dawson 3-2-11H". There will be a GR-CBL ran from KOP to Surface and Mud Logs ran on the well from approximately 8,000’ to TD. <br/>DST's: No DST’s are planned. <br/>  <br/>Cores: No cores are currently planned <br/>  <br/>The proposed Evaluation Program may change at the discretion of the wellsite geologist, with prior approval from the Authorized Officer. <br/>Stimulation: Proposed plan is to run 50—Stage “Plug and Perf” tools in liner—spaced roughly 175’ apart. <br/>A stimulation or frac treatment will be designed for completion of this well based on post <br/>completion production rates. The drill site, as approved, will be sufficient size to accommodate all completion activities. </p>

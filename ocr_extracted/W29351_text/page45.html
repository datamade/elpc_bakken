The average ROP through this formation is 47 feet/hour with a range of 13—232 feet/hour. The gas count averaged 72 units with a range of 11—185 units. The formation is dominated by limestone with minor amounts of anhydrite and dolomite. Samples looked like: LIMESTONE: Cream, tan, light tan, cream tan, light brown, packstone to wackestone, argillaceous, calcareous, carbonaceous, mottled, ﬁrm, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy cut. <br/>Lodgepole 9,436’MD 9,423’ TVD -7,159’SS <br/>The Lodgepole was identiﬁed at 9,436’ MD and 9,423’ TVD from the ROP and sample change along with gamma. Drilling rates in the Lodgepole averaged 45 feet/hour and ranged from 11-181 ﬂ/hr with gas ranging from 11 to 432 units. Typical samples were: LIMESTONE: Light gray, medium gray, gray, light brown, tan, light tan, cream, off white, packstone to wackestone, calcareous, carbonaceous, argill‘ace‘ou‘s, soft to ﬁrm, fair intergranular porosity, scattered bright yellow ﬂuorescence, instant cloudy cut. KOP was reached in this formation at 9,684’ MD on November 3, 2014. <br/>Curve 9,684 ’ — 10,515 ’ MD </p>

Gamma markers were utilized throughout the Lodgepole to correlate to the Miller 44-11H, and the Kaldahl 34-12 wells. One target adjustment was made during the curve. It was made aﬂer the well encountered the Upper Bakken Shale, the decision was made to move the target up from 10,191 ’ TVD to 10,189’ TVD. Samples below KOP were: LIMESTONE: Light gray, cream, tan, light brown, cream tan, off white, packstone to wackestone, soﬁ to ﬁrm, argillaceous, calcareous, carbonaceous, <br/>poor intergranular porosity, scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy cut. The EOC was reached at 10: 15 am CST at a depth of 10,515 on November 4, 2014. <br/>False Bakken 10,156’ MD 10,072’ TVD -7,808’ SS <br/>The False Bakken came in at a MD of 10,156’ with the TVD of 10,072’ it was picked off of'Gamma. The correlation sheet did not show a target change so there was no <br/>change to the target made. The gas peeked up to 814 units and the gamma went as high as 90 API. </p>

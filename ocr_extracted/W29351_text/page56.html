The background ’gas in the Bakken Shale averaged 762 and ranging from 309 to ‘1’1 '1 '1 units. The top of the Bakken Shale was picked off of gamma, ROP along with the samples. The typical sample was SHALE: Dark gray, charcoal to black, hard, brittle, mostly angular, no intergranular porosity, even dull yellow green mineral ﬂuorescence, and instant dull dark yellow green milky cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,202 ’ MD 10,100 ’ TVD - 7, 836’ SS <br/>At 10,100’ TVD the Middle Bakken was encountered. This top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The Middle B'akken exhibited SILTSTONE: light to medium gray, light gray tan, gray banding, trace sandstone, argillaceous, slightly carbonaceous, soﬁ to ﬁrm induration, fair intergranular porosity, bright scattered blue green ﬂuorescence, instant milky to cloudy cut. <br/>Lower Bakken 1 0,320 ’ MD 10,153 ’ TVD - 7, 889 ’ SS <br/>Lower Bakken came in at 10,320’ MD and 10,153’ TVD. This top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. Gamma in the Lower Bakken ranged from 125 API to 822 API. Background gas averaged 776 units and had a maximum of 1066 units and a minimum of 393 units. Typical sample in the Lower Bakken was: SHALE: Black, ﬁrm, blocky, waxy, ﬁssile, no intergranular porosity, scattered dull yellow ﬂuorescence, no out </p>

The true vertical depth was 10,177’. The Three Forks was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The samples here were: DOLOMITE: Light tan, cream, light brown, light gray, gray, off white, silty, microcrystalline, very ﬁne, microsucrosic, mottled, calcareous, carbonaceous, solt to ﬁrm, argillaceous, poor intergranular porosity, bright even green ﬂuorescence, very weak streaming cut. <br/>The curve was landed in the Three Forks at 10,515’ MD and 10,190.27” TVD on November 4, 2014 at 10:15 am CST. At this point the rig tripped out of the hole to start running casing. The casing shoe was set at 10,499’ MD. <br/>The Lateral 1 0, 515—20, 555 ’ MD <br/>Drilling resumed in the lateral portion of the wellbore on December 27, 2014 at 4 :3 5 am CST. Alter drilling out of the shoe the samples consisted of DOLOMITE: Light tan, cream, light brown, light gray, gray, off white, silty, microcrystalline, very ﬁne, microsucrosic, mottled, calcareous, carbonaceous, soft to ﬁrm, argillaceous, moderate pyrite, poor intergranular porosity, dull yellow ﬂuorescence, very weak streaming cut. </p>

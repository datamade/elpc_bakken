    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">EOG Resources Parshall 23-3029H is a horizontal well located in NW/NE Section 30 T152N R90W in Mountrail County, North Dakota, and was drilled by H&P 316, with surface and Kelly bushing elevations of 1,880’ and 1,904’ respectively. The three phases of Parshall 23-3029H were vertical, curve, and horizontal sections, with the horizontal section targeting the Middle Bakken formation. Parshall 23 -3029H had a spud date of October 20, 2014, with geological logging and gas detection services beginning at 7,280’ MD in the Kibbey formation. Legged thirty foot samples (with occasional lagged ten foot samples to determine formation tops in all sections) were collected in the vertical and curve sections, and lagged one hundred foot samples were collected in the horizontal section. All samples were washed, dried, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core and Sample Library, located on the campus of the University of North Dakota in the city of Grand Forks. Parshall 23-3 029H reached TD of 16,640’ MD at 3:55 PM CDT on November 1, 2014 in SW/SE Section 29 T152N R90W. <br/>Vertical Section 7,280’ -— 8,870’ AID <br/>Logging services began at 7,280’ MD in the bottom of the Kibbey formation on October 24, 2014. The gas detection system was tested before reaching logging depth to ensure that the system was functioning correctly. The logged vertical section was drilled through the Charles and Mission Canyon formations, and into the Lodgepole formation, where rate of penetration (ROP) ranged from 0.10 to 1.90 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas meaSurements ranged from 22 to 73 units. Kick off point (KOP) was reached within the Lodgepole formation at 4:30 AM CDT on October 25, 2014 at 8,870’ MD. <br/>Charles 7,367 ’ 1WD 7,366 ’ T VD -5,462’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Charles formation top was picked at 7,367’ MD/—5,462’ SS. ROP in the Charles formation ranged from 0.10 to 0.90 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas measurements ranged from 22 to 73 units. Samples generally consisted of limestone, which were light gray to light brown, slight reddish brown, cream tan gray, dark gray in part, carbonaceous to argillaeeous, wackestone to packstone, with moderately poor induration, fair to good intergranular porosity, yellow green to dark gray ﬂuorescence, and a slow streaming cut. <br/>Base of the Last Salt 7, 796’ MB 7, 794’ TVD -5,890’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered within the Charles formation at 7,796’ MD/-5,890’ SS. This was picked by the last sample collected in the Charles formation with a majority of salt present with minor limestone and anhydrite, and by a decrease in ROP during transition from the last salt bed into beds of limestone with minor anhydrite </p>

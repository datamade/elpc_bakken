The cross into the top half of zone also brought a brief change to a 900° target angle. After drilling only 500 more feet, the change proved incorrect. The previous target angle of 902° at a 5 foot higher position were reapplied at the mid-point of the lateral. <br/>The wellbore continued tracking zone, high to center, for 1,200 feet before the next target change. According to structural maps available at the time, the formation was expected to flatten over the course of the remaining lateral. At measured depth 16,200 feet, an estimated 900° was applied to the target. The 2-3 foot shift placed the wellbore just above center as it was coming up in zone. The assembly tracked the upper half of the new target out t018,000 feet, measured depth. At this depth, sample lag time of 60 minutes and their declining quality had increased the emphasis upon gamma data for Geosteering. Gamma values coming in were showing a formation angle of 902° or greater. Still with a reasonable amount of control over the assembly, the wellbore was held above center of the new target, Over the course of the next 1,000 feet the <br/>target was progressively raised and by measured depth 19,250 feet, formation was being projected at 90.3 5°. <br/>The sharp rise in formation nearing total depth had not been expected. With an increasing amount of effort, the assembly was held in the top half of zone for all but the ﬁnal 400 measured feet. On October 22"“, 2014 at 10:00 am CT total depth of the Mrachek 21—26-3HR was reached with a measured depth of 20,245 feet and true vertical depth of 10,777 feet with the wellbore placed on the bottom line of an 8’ target windowr </p>

Lithology of the second half of the lateral continued the same as the ﬁrst. Tan to light brown and occasionally translucent dolomite with strong shows of petroleum in the upper half. While the lower portions of the middle Bakken become darker in color as the amount of bioturbated, detrital sediment increased with depth. The highest gas values were still being seen at the highest points of the target window. The total gas background average had increased by 100 units to 550 total units in the last 5,000 feet of lateral. The stronger shows of gas and petroleum continued to occupy the upper half of the target which also offered the most efﬁcient drilling rates. A possible up-dip, formational trend was known to be a possibility however the estimated 90.35° was an unexpected features <br/>John Nygard WeIIsite Geologist </p>

    <p class="styleSans792.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>The Tyler Formation was observed at 7,519’ MD (7,518’ TVD; -5,599’ SS), 3’ higher than the prognosis. The Tyler top was identiﬁed by GR signature and rate of <br/>penetration (ROP). ROP averaged 0.6 minutes per foot (100 feet/hour). Background gas averaged 40 units and a peak reading of 51 units was recorded. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Tyler Formation. <br/>LIMESTONE: Rust red, scattered black and white grains; calcareous, silty, moderate porosity, moderate induration; little to no ﬂuorescence, pale white slow cut. <br/>Kibbey Lime 8,073 ’ MD 8,072 TVD -6,153 ’ SS <br/>The Kibbey Lime marker was encountered at 8,073’ MD (8,072’ TVD; -6,153 ’ SS), 8’ lower than the prognosis. The Kibbey Lime marker was picked by the change in ROP and GR signature. ROP through the Kibbey averaged 0.9 minutes per foot (67 <br/>feet/hour). Background gas averaged 31 units and a peak reading of 39 units was recorded. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Kibbey Formation. <br/>A representative sample: <br/>LIMESTONE: Light tan, off white to white, trace light brown, trace argillaceous, moderate induration, tight, scattered pale yellow ﬂuorescence, slow clear very pale yellow cut. <br/>Charles 8,249’ MD 8,248’ TVD -6,329’ SS <br/>The Charles Formation was encountered at 8,249’ MD (8,248’ TVD; -6,329’ SS), 40’ lower than the prognosis. The Charles was identiﬁed by ROP, GR signature, and cuttings lithology. ROP through the Charles Formation averaged 0.5 min/ﬂ (120 feet/hr). Background gas averaged 44 units with a peak recorded reading of 54 units. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Charles Formation. <br/>A representative sample: SALT: Clear, hard, massive; trace anhydrite, limestOne, shales; no shows. <br/>Base of Last Salt 8,882 ’ MD 8, 881 ’ TVD —6, 962 ’ SS <br/>The BLS was identiﬁed via rate of penetration, GR signature, and cuttings lithology at 8,882’ MD (8,881 ’ TVD; -6,962’ SS), 3’ lower than the prognosis. <br/>Mission Canyon 9, 096’ MD 9,095 ’ T VD -7,176’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon Formation was observed at 9,096’ MD (9,095’ TVD; 7,176’ SS), 4’ lower than the prognosis. The Mission Canyon top was identiﬁed via GR signature, ROP, and cuttings lithology. ROP averaged 0.5 minutes per foot (120 feet/hour). Background gas averaged 43 units and a peak reading of 59 units was recorded. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Mission Canyon Formation. </p>

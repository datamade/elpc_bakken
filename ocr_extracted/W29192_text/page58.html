    <p class="styleSans14.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The top of the Lodgepole was picked at 10,343’ TVD, about 14’ feet high to prognosis but 2’ lower than the adjacent Rennerfeldt 8—30H1 well. The pick was based oﬁ‘ of the gamma marker and sample change, along with ROP and differential pressure changes. Drill rates in the Lodgepole above KOP averaged 1.27 minutes per foot with gas up to 23 units. Typical samples were medium gray to dark gray Limestone, and grainy, ranging from packstone to wackestone. Samples were banded, moderately indurated, and poor to fair porosity. Cuts and ﬂuorescence shows were sporadic and questionable due to the oil-based mud. <br/>Curve 10,650’ — 11,404’ MD <br/>The kick-off point for the curve was reached at 10,650’ MD at 1:06 PM CST on November 16*, 2014. Drilling of the curve began at 12:11 PM CST on November 17*, 2014. <br/>Because marker consistency (no more than +/- 1’ TVD) with the adjacent Rennerfeldt 8-3 0H1 well, the target landing point was held at 11,094’ TVD. Offset well data used for the curve was the Rennerfeldt 8-30H1 as well as the Seaton 14-30. The curve was landed at 11,404’ MD, at 6:44 AM on November 18th, 2014. The landing TVD was 11,089.84’ at an inclination of 89.69 degrees, as projected to the bit. Drill rates in the Curve Section averaged 3.0 minutes per foot with gas averaging 258 units and a maximum of 3386 units. </p>

Samples did not vary from other lower Lodgepole limestone, with the exception of the increase in argillaceous shale present. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 11,166’ MD 11,053 ’ T VD -8, 745’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was encountered at a TVD of 11,053’ which was 1’ higher than prognosis. The average ROP was 0.71 minutes per foot, and gas averaged 766 units and a maximum of 1443 units. A typical sample was black, gritty, blocky to platy, ﬁssile shale with disseminated pyrite. Cuts and ﬂuorescence shows were questionable due to the oil-based mud. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>Three Forks 10,558’ MD 10,331 ’ T VD -8,259’ SS <br/>At 10,331’ TVD the Three Forks was entered. The top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The typical samples consisted of siltstone that was medium grayish brown, light grayish brown, trace off white, arenaceous, argillaceous, dolomitic, with poor induration. Lithology also included trace to moderate shale that was medium bluish gray, waxy, platy, blocky, with moderate induration. Samples exhibited poor intergranular porosity, light brown oil staining, even to scattered dull to pale yellow green ﬂuorescence, with generally instant bright yellow to yellow-green cuts. <br/>Completed drilling curve at 1:15 am CST on November 17, 2014 at 10,730' MD and True Vertical Depth of 10,3 59.74'. <br/>Lateral 10, 730’ — 16,013 ’ MD <br/>The Barb W. 11-6TFH Three Forks Lateral was begun at 4: 10 am November 19, 2014. The initial dip rate of the lateral would be at 90.1 degrees. <br/>November 20, 2014 11,200’MD 10,3 58’ TVD <br/>The day would start out with us by taking 30’ surveys to make the lateral turn. As we were making the lateral turn it took numerous slides to make the turn and keep the well bore in the target zone. We made a target adjustment to steepen up the target window to 90.1 to 90.21. Before we ﬁnished the lateral turn we made a seconded target change to ﬂatten the formation dip to 90.0 from 90.21. The ROP for the day would average 80 ﬁ/hr. Gas would range between 279-2516 units. Samples would be a <br/>Siltstone: Light to cream blue gray, light gray, with slow to instant diffused streaming to instant cloudy cut. <br/>November 21, 2014 12,960’ MD 10,358’ TVD <br/>In the aﬁemoon the target was adjusted at 14,500’ MD to steepen up the target window to 90.34 from 90.00 degrees. We ran this formation dip all the way to TD. At 6:30pm the decision was made to TOOH for new bit. The ROP for the day would be 80.9 <br/>ﬁ/hr. Gas would average 851 units. Samples would consist of a light gray to light brown Siltstone. <br/>November 22, 2014 13,672’ MD 10,347’ TVD <br/>Aﬁer TOOH for new bit we got back to bottom at 10:25am CDT on November 22, 2014. Aﬁer getting back to bottom we continued drilling the last 93 8ft to reach TD of the well. The ROP for the day would average 90 ﬁ/hr. Gas would average 780 units with spikes up to 2805 units. Samples would be a light brown to light grayish brown Siltstone. </p>

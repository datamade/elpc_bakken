The initial phase of the Barb W. 11-6TFH is a vertical section, with a subsequent curve landing within the ﬁrst bench of the Three Forks Fm. The Barb W. 11-6TFH spuddcd November 2, 2014 and reached a total depth of 16,013’MD on November 22, 2014. Well site geological services began at 8,450 feet in the Charles Formation. Thirty and ﬁﬁy foot lagged samples were collected. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 8,450’ — 9, 828’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 8,450 feet measured depth in The Charles Fonnation Gas detection system was recalibrated and tested before logging depth with system <br/>ﬁmctioning correctly. Drill rates ranged from 1.0—3.5 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 11-50 units. </p>

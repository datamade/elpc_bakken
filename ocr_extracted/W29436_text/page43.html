The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.80* API burst rating to determine the max pressure. 3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment. 4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during the flowback than during the frac job. 5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates. 6.

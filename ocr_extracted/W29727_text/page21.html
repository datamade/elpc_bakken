    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation, Eide 41~13HU was drilled as a Timber Creek well with primary interest in the Middle Bakken formation. The well was drilled by Pioneer 74 ﬂex rig. The well is located in the NENE quarter of Section 13 T1 SON R100W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Eide 41—13HU was spudded on November 10, 2014 at 9:30 AM CST. The well reached a total depth of 20,673’ MD on December 26, 2014. Geological services began at 9,300’ MD in the Charles formation on November 14, 2014 and continued to TD. Samples were caught by mudloggers throughout the well. All samples were washed, cataloged, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Society in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Total Gas LTD gas equipment was used to monitor gas throughout the well in correspondence with RigSense EDR. <br/>Vertical 9,300’ — 10,677’ MD </p>

The vertical secti0n of the Eide 41-13HU was drilled using two Reed DS616M-X1 8 %” drill bits. Rate of penetration varied throughout the different rock types and formations but averaged 122 feet per hour throughout the vertical section Gas averaged 30 units with a maximum reading of 241 units. The Pioneer 74 ﬂex rig reached kick off point at 6:00 AM CST on November 15, 2014 at 10,677 feet. <br/>Base of Last Salt 9, 586’ MD 9,5 76’ T VD -7, 281 ’ SS <br/>The Base of Last Salt formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,586 feet, 22 feet low to the prognosis. It was picked by a low to high spike in gamma starting at 9,596 feet MD. Samples also changed from salt that was clear and translucent to off white anhydrite. The lithology of the Base of Last Salt formation was mainly light gray to gray limestone with an even yellow white ﬂuorescence and slow cloudy cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 133 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 66 units with a maximum of 219 units through the Base of Last Salt formation. <br/>Mission Canyon 9, 790’ MD 9, 780’ T V1) - 7,485 ’ SS </p>

It was picked by a high spike in gamma at 9,790 feet MD. Samples also changed from gray, dark gray, cream gray limestone to gray, light gray limestone. The lithology of the Mission Canyon formation was limestone that was light tan gray, cream tan, and cream gray that produced an even ﬂuorescence and weak cuts. Rate of penetration was an average of 111 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 28 units with a max of 129 units through the Mission Canyon formation. </p>

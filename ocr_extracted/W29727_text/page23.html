Drilling ceased with a true vertical depth of 11,142.96 feet and measured depth of 11,500 feet, landing just under 7 feet into the Middle Bakken formation. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling resumed on December 21, 2014 at 9: 15 AM CST in the Middle Bakken formation. According to the structure map, it was believed this well would average a 90.2 degree up dip - expecting formation to come up a total of about 32 feet throughout the lateral section. The Eide 41-13HU was drilled as a Hidden Bench Prospect and in the Timber Creek Field. From out of the shoe to 14,000 feet, the dip was ﬂat at 90 degrees and was determined so by gamma correlations using the C/D facie contact. From 14,000 feet to 16,000 feet the dip started to come up between 90.23 and 90.34 degrees for a total of seven feet of TVD. For the next 1,000 feet the dip ﬂattened again to 90 degrees, before coming back up from 90.17 to 90.21 degrees for the remainder of the lateral. In total, the Eide 41-13HU, the formation came up a total of approximately 22 feet. <br/>The Eide 41-13HU horizontal was completed in four runs. The decision was made at 12306' MD to trip out of the hole for motor failure at 10:00 PM CST on December 21, 2014. Drilling resumed at 10: 10 AM CST on December 22, 2014. The decision was made at 12561' MD to trip out of the hole for MWD failure at 1:00 PM CST on December 22, 2014. Drilling resumed at 11:30 PM CST on December 22, 2014. The decision was made at 12730' MD to trip out of the hole for motor failure at 1:45 AM CST on December 23, 2014. Drilling resumed at 2: 15 PM CST on December 23, 2014. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The lithology of the Middle Bakken formation was siltstone and sandstone that was relatively medium to dark in color. The majority of the Eide 41-13HU lateral section was drilled in the C and D facies. The target window set by Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation was 10 feet and was set 10 to 20 feet into the Middle Bakken formation. The bottom of the target window reﬂected the transition from C facies to the D facies. Throughout the C facies, samples were relatively light to medium in color and dominate colors were gray, tan gray, brown, light brown, and medium to dark gray. The footage drilled below the target window, in the D facies, samples changed from light to medium in color to a more of a dark and dull variety; samples were ranged from dark gray, gray, dark tan, and tan gray. Along with gamma interpretations, these subtle differences in color, as we transitioned through the zone, made it possible to distinguish structural position. <br/>Rate of penetration was an average of 188 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 400 units with a <br/>max of 4697 units through the Middle Bakken formation - yielding a consistent 2 to 5 foot ﬂare from 16,000 feet to TD. </p>

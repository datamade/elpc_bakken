It was picked by a slight up spike in gamma at 10,322 feet MD. The lithology of the Lodgepole formation was mainly limestone that was gray, tan gray, and light gray with an even green ﬂuorescence and weak cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 130 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 45 units with a max of 387 units through the Lodgepole formation. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Curve 10,677’MD—11,500’MD <br/>The curve was started at 7:50 AM CST on November 17, 2014 with an 8 3/4” Reed curve bit and a NOV 2.38 mud motor targeting the Middle Bakken formation with an initial target TVD of 11,141 feet and 15 feet into the Middle Bakken formation. The Lodgepole markers were correlated to the Eide 41-13H gamma data. Baker Hughes directional team started the curve with an average built rate of 12 degrees per 100 feet needed. While correlating gamma signatures to the Eide 41-13H, the landing target stayed consistent between 11,141 feet and 11,144 feet TVD. Once the False Bakken formation was encountered, it was apparent that the ideal landing target would be 11,144 feet TVD to land 15 feet into the Middle Bakken formation. <br/>False Bakken 11,256 ’ MD 11,104’ TVD ~8,809’ SS <br/>The False Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,256 feet, 5 feet high to the prognosis. The pick of the False Bakken was primarily done oﬂ‘ gamma correlation to the Eide 41-13H curve gamma. The lithology of the False Bakken formation was tan gray to light tan gray with an even green ﬂuorescence and a fast streaming cloudy cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 98 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 144 units with a maximum of 511 units through the False Bakken formation. <br/>Upper Bakken 11,300 ’ MD 11,118 ’ TVD -8, 823 ’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,300 feet, 2 feet high to the prognosis. The pick of the Upper Bakken was primarily done off gamma correlation to Eide 41-13H curve gamma. The lithology of the Upper Bakken formation was shale that was black and dark brown with a bright even green ﬂuorescence and a thick yellow cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 150 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 256 units with a maximum of 505 units through the Upper Bakken formation. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,389’ MD 11,136 ’ TVD -8,841 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,389 feet, 1 foot low to the prognosis. The pick of the Middle Bakken was primarily done off gamma correlation to the Eide 41-13H curve gamma. The lithology of the Middle Bakken formation was sandstone and siltstone that was gray, tan gray, and dark gray that was ﬁne to very ﬁne grained. Rate of penetration was an average of 92 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 167 units with a max of 354 units through the Middle Bakken formation. </p>

(AET) has completed the <br/>laboratory work for the soil chemistry and hydraulic conductivity testing for the soil cement stabilization performed at this well site. The soil has been stabilized with cement to improve the stability and load carrying capacity of the subgrade, allowing a thinner layer of aggregate <br/>surfacing to be placed in the working and driving areas and reducing future maintenance time <br/>and costs. <br/>Sampling and Testing <br/>Soil samples were obtained from the site by representatives of FDS on July 26, 2012. The material was tested for sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), cation exchange capacity (CEC), speciﬁc conductance (EC), pH, hydraulic conductivity as well as Atterberg limits, wash 200 sieve analysis, and standard Proctor moisture—density relationship. The chemical laboratory test results <br/>were performed by Pace Analytical Services, Inc. or a subcontractor they selected.

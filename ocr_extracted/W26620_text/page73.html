    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Petro-Hunt LLC, Glovatsky 145-98-24D-13-2H well was drilled as a single lateral horizontal well, targeting approximately 20 feet into the Middle Bakken Formation. Surface location was 1,280' FEL, 250‘ FSL, Section 24 T145N R98W, McKenzie County, North Dakota. Bottom hole location of this well was 949.83' FEL; 274.31‘ FNL, Section 13 T154N, McKenzie County, North Dakota. <br/>The Glovatsky 145-98-24D-l3-2H spudded on October 21, 2014 and reached a total depth (TD) of 20,929’ measured depth (MD) on November 19, 2014, 30 days from spud. Prior to logging, 9 5/8 inch surface casing was set at 2,476 feet MD, while 7 inch intermediate casing was set at a measured depth of 11,364 feet. Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided logging services from a measured depth of 7,500’ starting at 8:45 pm CT on October 27, 2014. Samples from a measured depth of 7,500’ to TD were caught. These samples were described and logged. Services included sample logging and gas monitoring. Gamma monitoring was included after tripping into hole (TIH) at 10,377’ MD on November 1, 2014 when Measurement While Drilling (MWD) gamma tool was included in the Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA) at Kick-Off Point (KOP). <br/>This well was drilled using an invert drilling ﬂuid for the vertical and curve, and a saltwater-based drilling ﬂuid for the lateral. Frank Hurt and RaeLea Hurt, of Neset Consulting Service, Inc. of Tioga, North Dakota provided wellsite geology, mudlogging, and gas monitoring services. Gas monitoring equipment included Total Gas Detector to measure background, connection, and trip gas levels. <br/>Thirty—foot lagged cutting samples were collected, analyzed, and recorded throughout the wellbore. Thirty-foot samples were collected through the entirety of the lateral, with ten—foot samples collected when questions arose regarding lithology changes. Sample collection technique consisted of Spot Samples taken from a consistent location on the shaker screens or from within the solids control bin directly beneath the shakers. The latter location provided for a more representative sample. <br/>Mudlogging began in the Pine Salt Formation. This formation, like all of the others, reﬂects consistent diagenesis of sedimentary deposition in this basin. Wireline logging was to be performed following TD of the well. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Vertical and Curve 7,5 00’— 11,364 ’MD <br/>Logging began in the Pine Salt formation at 8:45 pm CT on October 27, 2014, at a depth of 7,500' MD. Brought gas detector online. <br/>Lithology within the Pine Salt was typically: SALT: Translucent to white, angular, blocky, hard, moderate dolomite, red-brown, light to medium grey, medium grain, ﬁrm to hard, trace anhydrite, cream to light grey, ﬁrm, scattered to slightly even dull white ﬂuorescence, instant milky white cut, fast pinpoint streaming with blue- grey halo. <br/>Opeche Salt 7,53 6 ’MD 7,532 ’ T VD -4,939’SS <br/>The Opeche Salt formation top was identiﬁed based on ROP signature, and was made at 7,532' TVD. This was 15' higher than the prognosis. ROP averaged 35-50 feet/hour within anhydrite-dominant strata, 180-200 feet/hour <br/>within salt benches. Background gas was minimal and averaged 11 units, with no connection gas observed. </p>

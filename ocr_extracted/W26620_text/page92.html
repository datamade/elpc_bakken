Laid down tools, picked up tools, TIH. Resumed building the curve at 10: 15 pm November 2, 2014. Maximum trip gas was 112 <br/>units. . <br/>The following Lodgepole GR signatures calculated out to a target within 4' TVD above and below 11,058' TVD target assignment; no change was made to that target as of time of report. <br/>Background gas remained minimal, until a signiﬁcant gas kick of 5,977 units at 11,018‘ MD lagged was observed. This kick coincided approximately with a similar kick at this approximate TVD on the previous well drilled on this pad. Background gas remained elevated thereafter, averaging 2,000-4,000+ units, with connection gas of 5,000 units. Running through <br/>the gas buster, background gas decreased to 1,000+ units on average. The False Bakken interval of the Lodgepole formation correlated against the curve target <br/>assignment within 1' TVD. Upper Bakken Shale 11,134 ’MD 11,033 ’ T VD -8,440’SS <br/>The Upper Bakken formation top was identiﬁed at 11,033' TVD, which was 11 foot lower than the original prognosis. This correlated within 1' TVD of the curve target assignment. Background gas averaged 800-900 units, while running through the gas buster. <br/>Typical lithology recorded in the Upper Bakken Shale was: SHALE: Black, brown black, ﬁrm to soft, microcrystalline, moderately compacted, splintered, carbonaceous, sparse limestone, grey, dark grey to medium brown, trace siltstone, no intercrystalline porosity, even dull green ﬂuorescence, instant milky pale yellow-white to streaming cloudy yellow- green cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,166’MD 11, 042’ TVD -8,449’SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was identiﬁed at 11,042' TVD, which correlated against a target of 11,055' TVD (3' higher than assigned target). Landed the curve at 12:20 am November 4, 2014. Projection to bit: MD 11364 INC 90 AZ 358.3 TVD 11058.78 VS 485.61 </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Performed wiper trip following TD of curve. <br/>Lost circulation occurred, necessitating trip back to 5,000' MD. <br/>Drilling ﬂuid volume was built back up for system, circulated into drill string in stages while TIH. <br/>The gas detector was serviced prior to TIH, in preparation of eventual circulation of bottoms-up and anticipated potential gas volume. <br/>Continued circulating in drilling ﬂuid in stages. Circulating bottoms-up with the bit in the lower Lodgepole through Middle Bakken, gas readings increased to 2,000-3,000 units on average. Mud was weighed up to 10.2 pounds, after which gas levels decreased to 600-900 units on average. <br/>Maximum trip gas reading was 4,406 units. TOH commenced. Ran intermediate casing. <br/>Background gas due to pipe displacement averaged 300-500 units. Circulating at reduced rate, maximum trip gas was 2,879 units. Gas detector was inspected and serviced prior to circulation. <br/>Rigged up cementers in preparation of cementing intermediate casing. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 10,896 ’ MD 10, 771 ’ TVD -8,498 ’ SS <br/>The Bakken Shale was picked off of gamma change. Samples were shale, black, noncalcareous, carbonaceous, pyritic, smooth, ﬁssile in part, blocky to sub-blocky, no porosity, abundant dull green ﬂuorescence, immediate bright milky yellow cut. Gas increased to up to 189 units. The Upper Bakken shale came in 5’ low to prognosis. <br/>Middle Bakken Member 10,951 ’ MD 10, 788’ TVD -8,515’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken Member was picked from gamma change. Samples were dolomite, light gray brown, light brown, tan, minor cream, microcrystalline, rarely pyritic, moderately silty, moderately calcareous, slightly argillaceous, earthy, microsucrosic in part, poor intercrystalline porosity, rare spotty dark brown oil stain, scattered dull yellow green ﬂuorescence, with an immediate bright milky white to yellow cut. Gas ranged from 26 to 116 units. The Middle Bakken Member came in 4’ low to prognosis. The curve was drilled to 11,072’ MD on December 6, 2014. Casing was set at 11,057’ MD, 10,801.57’ TVD with a BHL of238.26’ FNL & 1,176.90’ FEL in Sec 25, T150N, and R97W. <br/>Lateral #1 11,057’ MD—14,000’MD <br/>Casing was exited on December 9, 2014 at 11:30 am CT. Casing was set approximately 15’ into the Middle Bakken, at the very top of the target zone. The planned target was 13’ window with a hot marker at the top and a cool down at the bottom of the window. Coming out of casing the bit was at an azimuth of approximately 42° and a turn was made until the bit came to a 360° heading at 12,500’ MD. At this point drilling continued with the bit remaining in the upper half of the target zone until coming to the end of the section where the bit scraped slightly out of the top of target. There were no indicators of any geological signiﬁcance through this section of drilling and control and targeting went very smoothly. <br/>This section showed very low gas and no oil shows while drilling with a decrease in gas seen as the bit came down slightly to the middle of target zone. Refer to Appendix A to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. <br/>14,000’ —18,000’ MD <br/>The start of this section showed the bit scraping slight out the top of the target zone. Aﬁer coming down slightly the bit leveled off in the middle of target zone. At approximately 15,500’ MD the bit came up to the top of target zone due to a change where formation started to show a slight downward trend. The bit came down and leveled off in the middle of target zone where it remained to the end of this section. As the previous section showed, there were no signs of any signiﬁcant geological changes except a change in dip after coming to a high point. <br/>This section showed little to no gas and no oil shows while drilling. The small amounts and changes in gas can be attributed to lube sweeps and wide temperature swings with well above average daytime temperature readings. Refer to Appendix B to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. </p>

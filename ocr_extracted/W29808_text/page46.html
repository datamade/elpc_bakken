    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>Geologic Summary <br/>The Bailey 7—24XH was drilled as a single lateral horizontal well on a six well Eco-pad in Sec 25, T150N, R97W and ending in Section 13 T150N R97W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The target formation was the Middle Bakken. The surface location was set at 575’ FNL & 1,510’ FEL of Section 25. Drilling began on November 30, 2014 and continued until a TD of 21,740’ was reached at 9:15 am CT on December 15, 2014 and had ending coordinates of 240.82’ FNL & 670.58’ FEL ofSection l3 T150N R97W. <br/>Wellsite geological services consisted of two mudloggers. A Noram gas detecting system with chromatograph was utilized. Samples were caught at 30’ intervals from 8,515’ to end of the curve at 11,057 ’ MD and 100’ intervals throughout the lateral section to a TD of 21,740’ MD. All samples were saved and boxed to be sent to the State of North Dakota. <br/>Charles 8,515 ’ 1WD 8,514’ TVD -6,241 ’ SS <br/>The Charles formation was picked off of gamma. The Charles formation was salt, translucent, white, milky white, hard, brittle in part, massive, with intermittent stringers of anhydrite, white, light gray, amorphous, soft. At approximately 7,523’ samples changed to limestone, light brown, tan, yellow brown, cream, crypto to microcrystalline, fossiliferous at times, moderately calcareous, slightly argillaceous, ﬁrm to slightly soft, dolomitic in part, with frequent beds of salt observed. After the Base Last at 9,154’ MD, 9,153’ TVD (-6,880’ SS) samples returned to limestone, brown, dark brown, gray brown, crypto to microcrystalline, fossiliferous at times, very to moderately calcareous, argillaceous at times, ﬁrm to slightly soft, very dolomitic at times. Intervals of very poor intergranular porosity were observed and very slow streaming fluorescing cuts at times. Gas ranged from 2 to 56 units. The top of the Charles came in 1’ high to prognosis while the Base Last Salt came in with prognosis. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,36 7’ MD 9,366 ’ T VD - 7, 093 ’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was picked off of gamma and was limestone, dark brown, brown, minor light brown, microcrystalline, calcitic at times, moderately calcareous, moderately argillaceous, silty, ﬁrm to slightly hard, dolomitic at times, with intervals of poor intergranular porosity observed and very slow to fast streaming ﬂuorescing cuts at times. Gas ranged ﬁom 15 to 33 units. The Mission Canyon came in 2’ high to prognosis. <br/>Lodgepole 9, 926’ MD 9, 925’ T VD -7,652’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole formation was picked off of gamma. Samples were limestone, brown, light brown, gray brown, cream, tan, crypto to microcrystalline, scattered clear to milky calcite, moderate to very calcareous, moderately silty, argillaceous, ﬁrm to hard, dolomitic at times, earthy to chalky, with intervals of poor intergranular porosity observed and moderate to fast yellow white ﬂuorescing cuts at times. Gas ranged ﬁom 9 to 52 units. At 10,116’ MD a motor failure was seen and a trip for BHA was made. Due to proximity to KOP the curve assembly was picked up. After tripping in the drilling continued with rotation down to a KOP of 10,320’ MD at which time the curve was started. The Lodgepole came in 4’ high to prognosis. </p>

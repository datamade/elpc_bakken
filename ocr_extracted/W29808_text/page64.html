    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>18,000’ - 21, 740’ MD <br/>The start of this section showed the bit leveled off in the middle of target zone. It remained in this location until approximately 19,000’ MD when a change in dip caused the bit to jump up in angle, coming up to the top of and scraping slightly out the top of target zone; The top of target zone had a hard limestone stringer associated with it and there was slight diﬁiculty bringing the bit back through it into target. At approximately 19,900’ MD the bit broke back through and leveled off in the middle of the target zone. Drilling continued with the bit being maintained in the middle to upper portion of target zone until the last 300’ when the bit was rotated to TD, rising slightly and ﬁnishing at or just slightly out the top. TD was reached at 9: 15 am CT on December 15, 2014 and had a BHL of 240.82’ FNL & 670.58’ FEL in Section 13, T150N, and R97W. <br/>This section showed little gas and no oil shows while drilling. There was a slight increase seen that correlated with the structural change to a slight up dip. Refer to Appendix B to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. <br/>Conclusion <br/>Overall, the well had very poor gas and no oil shows. There appeared to be a streak in the upper portion of target zone that showed a slight increase in drill rates. This appeared to be less than 1’ thick and had no correlating gas or oil shows associated with it. Well was drilled with good control and had 95% of the well bore in the target window. The vast majority of the well was rotation at 93% with only 7% of it being slide. Well bore being maintained in this portion should make for a good frack job. Unfortunately, there were no clear indications as to the quality of this well and will have to wait until fracking to know. <br/>The Bailey 7—24XH is currently awaiting completion <br/>Ryan Genre Neset Consulting Service </p>

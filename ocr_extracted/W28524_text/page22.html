It is the same for pipeline LACTs and truck LACTs as follows: a) LACT ships 2,000 bbls or more in a month: LACT proved every month. b) LACT ships less than 2,000 bbls in a month: LACT is proved every quarter. c) In addition, to establish a comparative meter factor for a new LACT, the initial proving is followed by a second proving a month later, regardless of how much oil is shipped through the LACT for that month. <br/>Gas Continuous Measurement: Individual Well “Monthly Well GAS PRODUCTION”: a) Volumes of gas shall be metered at a dedicated single well separator/treater (at central facility) using either orifice plate or v-cone and Electronic Flow Measurement (EFM). <br/>  </p>

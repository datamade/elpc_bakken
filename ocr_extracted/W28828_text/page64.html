The TIH began until tagging cement where the cement, Float & Shoe and ten feet of new formation were drilled to perform the FIT test. After ﬁnishing with the FIT test drilling resumed with the South lateral with casing exited at a MD of 11,273’ at 10:15 pm. CDT on September 28, 2014. Drilling continued with the wellbore exiting casing at 93 degrees with the wellbore sitting about three feet below the base of the Middle Bakken target window. Slides were done throughout the night to work on the planned directional turn and to continue working on tracking the Middle Bakken target window with the wellbore slowly building in TVD back into the target window before rolling over and heading down section slowly at around 88 to 89 degrees. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 140 — 150 ft/hr while rotating and around 40 — 60 ﬂ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 400 ~ 600 units with connection gases reaching as high as 623 units while running through the gas buster with 350# on the choke and no ﬂare seen while drilling. The samples seen in the lower portion of the formation exhibited a cream gray tan/gray tan dolomite with an even light tan oil staining and an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Day 2 11,700’ — 12,850’ MD <br/>Drilling continued through the Middle Bakken target window with slides done throughout the day to work on the planned directional turn and to continue working on tracking the Middle Bakken target interval. The wellbore throughout the day steadily tracked the lower half of the Middle Bakken target window with slides done to continue to keep the wellbore at or slightly above dip to continue tracking the target window throughout the day. Penetration rates averaged around 140 — 160 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 20 — 30 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 400 — 600 units with connection gases reaching as high as 2,458 units while running through the gas buster with 375# on the choke and no ﬂare seen while drilling. The samples seen throughout the Middle Bakken target window exhibited 3 Cream tan/Cream gray tan dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Day 3 12,850’ —- 14,800’MD <br/>Drilling continued with the S lateral with the directional turn completed after reaching 174 degrees and surveys returning to every ninety feet instead of thirty feet. Drilling continued with the wellbore steadily tracking the lower half of the Middle Bakken target interval before slowly building in TVD through the target window towards </p>

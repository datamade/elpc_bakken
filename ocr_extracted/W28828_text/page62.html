    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Mission Canyon formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,629’, true vertical depth of 9,616’, fourteen feet high to prognosis. The top of the Mission Canyon was picked oﬂ‘ an increase in penetration rates as well as comparisons to the offsetting wells porosity benches throughout the Mission Canyon. Penetration rates throughout the upper portion of the Mission Canyon averaged around 20 - 30 ﬁlm with increases up to 40 ft/hr seen throughout the different porosity benches. The decision was made to TOOH at 9,748’ measured depth due to slow penetration rates. Tripped out of the hole, picked up a new bit and tripped back in the hole. The samples throughout the upper 100' of the formation exhibited primarily a gray brown/gray tan limestone with trace to moderate anhydrite present and occasional dolomite mixed in. The remainder of the formation exhibited primarily limestone with trace amounts of cream to oﬁlwhite anhydrite present. Background gases averaged around 60 » 120 units. The Mission Canyon formation was evaluated while drilling ahead. <br/>Lodgepole 10,132’ MD 10,119 ’ TVD -7,838’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 10,132’, True vertical depth of 10,119’, eighteen feet high to prognosis The Lodgepole formation was picked at the base of the lower Mission Canyon porosity as well as a sample change from a cream gray tan limestone to a cream gray/light to medium gray limestone. Penetration rates throughout the formation down to KOP averaged around 50 - 60 ft/hr with <br/>backgron gases averaging around 56 - 110 units. KOP was reached at 12:50 pm. CDT on September 6, 2014 at a measured depth of 10,490‘. <br/>Curve 10,490' - 11,293’ MD <br/>The curve for the South lateral was started in the Lodgepole Formation at a measured depth of 10,490' at 3:40 am. CDT on September 7, 2014. An 8 3/4” Hughes bit and 2.38 degree ﬁxed mud motor were used to build the curve. The landing target for the Skedsvold #21-4-4H at the beginning of the curve was set at 10,945’ @ 90 deg. based off the Lodgepole top and the ﬁrst two LP markers. The Skedsvold #21-4-5H and the Skedsvold #150—101-4B-9-1H were used for correlation purposes through the curve. Penetration rates at the beginning of the curve averaged around 80 - 90 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases through the Lodgepole formation averaged around 150 ~ 300 units. The lithology of the Lodgepole exhibited primarily a cream gray tan/light to medium gray limestone with occasional anhydrite and shale present. Gamma markers began to show that the lower portion of the Lodgepole had thickened slightly. After seeing this, the TVD landing target was lowered to a TVD of 10,948’. The remainder of the Lodgepole formation was drilled out and the False Bakken was encountered, </p>

The TII-I began with a shallow hole test completed on the MWD tool and continued down to a MD of 11,283’ where new drill line was slipped and cut and kill mud was pumped out of the hole The TII-I continued ﬁlling pipe about every 3,000’. Once on bottom trip gases were circulated out of the hole reaching as high as 5,191 units while running through the gas buster with 550# on the choke. Drilling resumed through the target interval with the wellbore tracking the lower half of the Middle Bakken target interval with slides done throughout the night to work on keeping the wellbore at or slightly above dip to continue tracking the target window. Penetration rates with the new assembly averaged around 120 ~ 150 ﬂ/hr while rotating and around 40 — 50 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 900 — 1,400 units while running through the gas buster with 420# on the choke and 3’ — 6’ ﬂare seen while drilling. <br/>Day 7 18,450’ — 19,970’ </p>

Gamma heated up from the C to D transition and slides were done to work on leveling the wellbore out to begin heading back up section towards the base of the target window. As the wellbore began to build in TVD and entered the base of the target interval dip was calculated after seeing the D to C repeat section giving the formation a calculated dip rate of 90.46 degrees. The wellbore was leveled out after reaching the middle portion of the Middle Bakken target window and continued to track the upper portion of the Middle Bakken target. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 70 — 90 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 20 — 30 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 900 —— 1,600 units while running through the gas buster with 420# on the choke and a 3’ — 8’ ﬂare seen while drilling. The samples in the upper portion of the formation exhibited a cream tan/cream gray tan dolomite. <br/>Day 8 19,970’ — 21,050’ </p>

Differential pressure spikes were experienced throughout the day causing the MWD tool to lose pulses. After seeing this and working on the MWD surface equipment the decision was made to continue drilling ahead to see if the MWD tool would start to work again. After drilling ahead about 10’ the tool remained inoperable. The decision was made to TOOH at a MD of 20,307 ’ due to MWD tool failure and Mud Motor failure. The TOOH began with kill mud pumped at the shoe before continuing out of the hole Once out of the hole a new Mud Motor and MWD tool were picked up and the TIH began with kill mud circulated out of the hole at the shoe. The TIH continued to bottom where trip gases were circulated out of the hole reaching as high as 6,258 units with a 10’ — 15’ ﬂare seen. Drilling resumed with the S lateral with the wellbore steadily tracking the Middle Bakken </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">the upper two feet of the target. As the wellbore reached this point the assembly began to head up section at around 91.5 degrees. The C to A contact was seen as the wellbore exited the top of the target window. Slides were done after seeing this to keep the wellbore pointed down and the top of the Middle Bakken target window was entered seeing the A to C repeat in gamma giving the formation a calculated dip rates of 90.1 degrees. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 100 — 120 ft/hr while rotating and around 30 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 400 — 600 units with connection gases reaching as high as 1,549 units while running through the gas buster with 375# on the choke and a three foot to six foot ﬂare seen while drilling. The <br/>samples seen in the upper portion of the formation exhibited a cream gray/cream gray tan dolomite. <br/>Day 4 14,800’ — 16,600’ NID <br/>Drilling continued through the target window with the wellbore slowly dropping in TVD through the Middle Bakken target interval. Slides were done to work on slowing the drop of the wellbore and the assembly was leveled out in the base of the Middle Bakken target window just seeing a slight warm up in gamma for the C to D contact. After rotating a few stand down the wellbore began to slowly build in T VD through the target interval reaching the upper portion of the target seeing the upper warm gamma from the C to A contact with slides done to work on rolling the wellbore over to continue tracking the Middle Bakken target window. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 100 — 120 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 20 - 30 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 700 — 900 units with connection gases reaching as high as 1,824 units while running through the gas buster with 375# on the choke and a 3' to 6' ﬂare seen while drilling. The samples seen in throughout the target interval continued to exhibit a cream tan/cream gray tan dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Day 5 16,600’ — 17,515’ MD <br/>Drilling continued through the Middle Bakken target window with the wellbore exiting the top of the Middle Bakken target interval seeing the C to A contact and conﬁrming that the current dip rate of90. 15 degrees was still correct. Slides were done after seeing the upper warm gamma and the wellbore was leveled out about two feet above the top of the target window before dropping in TVD slowly at around 89 degrees back into the Middle Bakken target window and continued to track the Middle Bakken target interval. At a MD of 17,515’ the decision was made to TOOH due to slow penetration rates aﬁer slowing to around 60 — 80 ﬁlm while rotating. The TOOH began with 12.5# kill mud pumped at the shoe. Backgron gases throughout the day averaged around 800 ~ 1000 units while running through the gas buster with 375# on the choke and a 3’ to 6’ ﬂare seen while drilling. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation Skedsvold #21-4-4H was drilled as a single lateral horizontal with the primary objective being in the Middle Bakken formation. This well is located in the NENW Section 4 T1 SON R101W of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Skedsvold #21-4-4H was spud on August 21, 2014 and reached a total depth for the vertical & curve at 11,293’ MD on September 8, 2014, nine days from spud. Total depth of the South Lateral was reached at 21,050’ MD on October 6, 2014, twenty days from spud. This well was drilled using an invert based mud system for the vertical & curve and Brine for the lateral. Shawn Morrow and Freddy Roberts of Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided wellsite mudlogging services, beginning at a depth of 9,200’ in the Charles Formation, through total depth in the Middle Bakken target. A NCS Total Gas detector was utilized for monitoring gas. Thirty foot lagged samples in the vertical & curve and ﬁﬁy foot lagged samples in the South Lateral were caught and saved to be archived at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Mudlogging began in the Charles Formation at a measured depth of 9,200’. Penetration rates throughout the Charles averaged around 100 - 110 ﬁ/hr through the salt benches and around 30 — 40 ft/hr throughout the limestone and anhydrite benches. Background gases in the Charles averaged around 28 - 45 units. The samples throughout the Charles exhibited alternating benches of anhydrite and limestone with occasional shale and dolomite present with the salt benches showing primarily a clear angular salt. The Charles was evaluated while drilling ahead. <br/>Base Last Salt 9,416’ MD 9,403 ’ T VD - 7,122’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last salt was encountered at a measured depth of 9,416’, true vertical depth of 9,403’, eighteen feet high to prognosis. Penetration rates through the last salt averaged around 80 — 100 ft/hr with 5K weight on bit and penetration rates through the remainder of the Charles averaged around 20 — 3O ﬁ/hr with 32K weight on bit. The samples throughout the lower portion of the Charles exhibited primarily anhydrite and limestone with traces of cream tan dolomite and gray shale present. The remainder of the Charles was drilled out and the Ratcliffe and Midale formations were encountered. Penetration rates through the Ratcliffe and Midale averaged around 30 - 35 ﬁ/hr with the samples showing primarily a gray tan limestone with layers of anhydrite and occasional <br/>cream tan dolomite present. The Ratcliffe and Midale formations were evaluated while drilling ahead. </p>

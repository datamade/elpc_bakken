<div style="position: absolute; margin-left: 275px; margin-top: 1017px;">
    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Continental Resources’ standard practice for running the cement bond log and casing caliper log is to run both logs immediately after coming out of the hole after TD, prior to running the 4-1/2” liner, to the deepest depth obtainable; however, if there are well control concerns that require us to run the liner sooner, only the CBL will be run and the CCL will be run after setting the liner. <br/>Based on the CCL results, we determine the actual API minimum burst allowance for the 7” casing. If the downgraded API burst pressure is below our minimum required frac pressures, we will run a 4-1/2” frac string; if severe wear or holes are found in the casing, we will run a 5” cemented, to surface, tie back string. <br/>The CBL log is run in order to determine the top of cement, as required by the NDIC. Our current 4-1/2” liner program for a 1280 unit is 30, evenly spaced, stages with 29 swellable packers. The liner shoe is set approximately 180 feet off bottom. The shoe stage below the last packer has 2 joints, a double valved ﬂoat, one joint, and a ported guide shoe — appx 130 ft. The liner is run using a running tool on the end of 4” DP. The 7” packer/hanger is set about 40 ft above KOP between two casing collars but conditions occasionally occur that require setting higher, either through unexpected failure or in order to isolate casing wear close to KOP. Recently we have tried 40 stage liners and the trend to explore the optimum stage count will continue.. Once the liner is at depth, a ball is dropped through the DP, the ball is pressured up against the setting tool to approximately 2500 psi, and the 7” packer/hanger is set. <br/>A push pull test is done to confirm the hanger has set. Then, a 4500 psi pressure test is completed on the back side of the 4” DP to confirm the packer has set. The setting tool is then backed off and the 4” DP/running tool is laid down. <br/>Immediately after the rotary rig has been moved off the well location, the 7” csg and liner packer/ hanger are tested to the frac pressure. The testers will rig up and test the tubing head to 5000 psi. Next a test plug will be run and set, using wire line, in the top of the 7” packer/hanger. Testers will pressure up to our frac pressure, typically 8500 psi, to confirm the 7” is ready for completion. </p>

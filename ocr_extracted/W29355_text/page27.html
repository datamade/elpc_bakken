    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation’s Knife River State #41-16TFH is a horizontal well targeting the Three Forks formation, to be drilled in a south southeast direction at a vertical section azimuth of 177.18 degrees for approximately 8,965 feet vertical section. The well is located in the NE V4, NE ‘/4, Section 16, Township 153N, Range 92W of Mountrail County, northwest of New Town, North Dakota. <br/>This well spud in on November 1“, 2014 at 1:30 AM CDT. Well site geological services; began at 8,450 feet measured depth on November 9”, 2014 at 6:00 AM CST. Ten, ﬁﬁeen, thirty, <br/>and ﬁfty-foot lagged samples were caught by mud loggers and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>A thirteen and one half inch wellbore was drilled to 2,094 feet measured depth, and nine and ﬁve eighths inch casing was run and cemented in place. The remaining vertical wellbore and curve was drilled, and seven inch intermediate casing was ran and set at 10,819 feet measured depth. Two six inch bits were used while drilling lateral number one. Neset Consulting Service, Inc. Total gas hotwire monitoring system was used for the duration of logging services. <br/>The Knife River State #41-16TFH vertical wellbore, with original curve, reached a total depth of 10,830 feet measured depth at 2:00 PM CST on November 12”, 2014, approximately 18 feet into the Three Forks, 11 days from spud. Horizontal leg began shortly before 9:30 AM CST on November 15TH, 2014, reaching a total measured depth of 19,240 feet on November 22"”), 2014 at 1:00 AM CST, 21 days ﬁom spud. <br/>Began logging in the Charles Formation <br/>Logging services began at 8,450 feet measured depth in the Charles formation at 6:00 AM CST on November 9TH, 2014. Charles consisted primarily of anhydrite, limestone, and interlarninated dolomitic lenses, along with trace to moderate reddish orange shale. Drill rates ranged from one to two minutes per foot. Background gas averaged 14 units. Base of the last salt was picked at 8,652 feet measured depth, 8,650 feet true vertical depth, with a drill break of .4 to 1.5 minutes per foot. Samples following consisted primarily of limestone, anhydrite, and minor dolomite, with a varying presence of shale through the Mission Canyon. <br/>Mission Canyon 8,826’ [MB 8,824’ T VD -6, 604’ SS <br/>Mission Canyon was picked at 8,826 feet measured depth, 8,824 feet true vertical depth The Mission Canyon consisted of predominantly light to medium cream gray, microcrystalline, fairly argillaoeous limestone, off white to cream white anhydrite and light tan, micro to cryptocrystalline dolomite. Drill rates averaged l to 1.5 minutes per foot through the Mission Canyon, with 14 to 35 units of average background gas. Even white mineral ﬂuorescence and slow, pinpoint streaming cut present in majority of samples caught. A trip was performed at 9,143 feet measured depth within the Mission Canyon due to MWD tool failure shortly before 10:30 PM CST on November 9m. Drilling resumed shortly after 9:00 AM CST on November 10TH. Due to low gas readings, a bump test was performed at the shakers and conﬁrmed correct operation of gas equipment. <br/>Lodgepole 9,474’ MD 9,472’ TVD -7,252’ SS <br/>Lodgepole was picked at 9,474 feet measured depth, 9,472 feet true vertical depth using MWD gamma data. Drill rates averaged two minutes per foot in the initial portion of the Lodgepole. Background gas averaged 20 to 25 units through the Lodgepo1e. An additional bump gas test was successfully performed on the morning of November 11 after background gas continued to average 17 units. </p>

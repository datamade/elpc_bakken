    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Through the drilling day of the l7TH of November, drill rates averaged 180 to 200 feet per hour while rotating, and from 40 to 60 feet per hour while sliding. Backgrormd gas averaged 882 units. Following 13,701 feet measured depth, the wellbore exited the top of the target window and contacted upper hot gamma markers. Multiple slides were implemented to correct the inclination, and to continue correcting the azimuth Dip rate calculations ﬂuctuated throughout the drilling day, averaging 89.27 degrees following 13,000 feet measured depth, and returning to 89.7 degrees through mid day and into the early morning Sliding became increasingly difﬁcult following 15,210 feet measured depth, requiring stacking over 150 thousand pounds on the bit. The drill string backed oﬂ‘ at surface while attempting to slide at 15,233 feet measmed depth Two joints of drill pipe were damaged and laid down, the shot pin assembly of the rotating link adapter of the top drive was also repaired <br/>Following the top drive repair, lateral drilling resumed at 11:00 AM CST on the morning of the 18m of November, with drill rates while rotating averaging between 190 and 210 feet per hour. Background gas averaged 596 units. The wellbore remained above the top of the target window for the duration of the drilling day due to multiple upward deﬂections. Slides were implemented in order to return to the window, but were not eﬂ‘ective. Observed dip remained consistent throughout the day at approximately 89.7 degrees. <br/>Through the morning and aﬁemoon of the l9TH of November, drill rates continued to average between 180 and 200 feet per hour while rotating, and from 50 to 70 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 37 units. The wellbore continued to remain above the top of the target window with upward deﬂections negating downward slides implemented, with the deﬂections continuing to occur right at the top of the window. Dip again steepened to an estimated 89.38 degrees following 16,763 feet measured depth While drilling ahead at 17,023 feet measured depth, diﬂ'erential pressure was lost. Following ineffective troubleshooting steps at surface, began trip to replace BHA at 2:00 PM CST. Tools were laid down at 9:30 PM CST, new tools were picked up and tripped in the hole, bit depth of 10,832 while tripping in as of mominn moon on the 20TH of November. </p>

The wellbore remained above the top of the target window through 17,500 feet measured depth, where slides were able to push through the deﬂective point and return to the top of the target window. The inclination of the wellbore dropped to 87 degrees, and slides were implemented to attempt to level the wellbore oﬂ near anticipated dip. Following 17,700 feet measured depth, the wellbore exited the base of the target window Localized dip rate going into the morning of the 21ST of November was 89.7 degrees. <br/>Through the morning and aﬂernoon of the 21ST of November, drill rates averaged between 110 and 130 feet per hour while rotating, and from 30 to 40 feet per hour while sliding Background gas averaged 444 units. Following 18,192 feet measure depth, the MWD gamma tool failed. The decision to continue drilling without gamma data was made, as the wellbore was near the base of the target window. The window was projected at 90 degrees with the instruction to remain within two feet of the base of the window. <br/>The Knife River State #41-16 Three Forks lateral number one reached a total depth of 19,240 feet measured depth approximately two feet above the base of the target window within clean gamma sandstone shortly after 1:00 AM CST on Saturday, November 22""), 2014, 21 days from spud, at 1,389 feet from the south line, and 570 feet from the east line of the NE SE ’/4 of Section 21, Township 153N, Range 92W, Mountrail Cormty, North Dakota. <br/>Derek Lidstrom.

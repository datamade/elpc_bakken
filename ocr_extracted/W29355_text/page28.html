    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Curve 9,855’ — 10,830’ MD <br/>Kick off point was selected within the Lodgepole at 9,855 feet measured depth, and was reached shortly after 7:30 PM CST on November 10TH, 2014. A trip was performed, and the curve assembly, including a Baker MMDSSM bit was picked up and tripped in the hole. Drilling of the curve began shortly before 10:00 AM CST on November 11TH, 2014. <br/>Correlations were made with the Knife River State #41-16H as well as the Knife River State 21-16TFH MWD logs using seven individual Lodgepole correlative markers and formation tops. The initial landing target based on the geological prognosis was set at 10,421 feet true vertical depth. The landing target was dropped twice while building the curve, initially to 10,425 feet following the Middle Bakken, and again to 10,430 feet following the Lower Bakken. Typical samples in the lower Lodgepole consisted of light to medium gray, brown, gray tan, cream, cream gray, medium tan to tan, light brown, very ﬁne to mierocrystalline, slightly argillaceous limestone, with trace anhydrite, and scattered light brown oil staining. <br/>False Bakken 10,344’ MD 10,265’ T V7) -8, 045’ SS <br/>False Bakken was picked at a measured depth of 10,344 feet, [0,265 feet true vertical depth. The Scallion was logged at 10,348 feet measured depth, 10,268 feet true vertical depth. Background gas increased to a peak of 174 units following the Scallion and into the Upper Bakken. <br/>Upper Bakken 10,3 70’MD 10,281’ TVI) -8,06I’SS <br/>Upper Bakken was reached at 10,3 70 feet measured depth; 10,281 feet true vertical depth with drill rates ranging from .6 to 1.2 minutes per foot. Background gas averaged 550 units through the Upper Bakken. Samples consisted of dark gray to black, blocky, carbonaceous shale, with trace amounts of dolomite and limestone, with a scattered yellow green ﬂuorescence, and instant cloudy, slow streaming yellow green cut, with cut drying to a good yellow gold ﬂuorescence halo, and under white light, gradually turning strong amber. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,401 ’ MD 10,300’ TVD -8, 080’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Middle Bakken was picked at 10,401 feet measured depth; 10,300 feet true vertical depth marked by a drop in penetration rates, and transition from shale to dolomitic, silty limestone noted in samples. Samples consisted of predominately medium to dark gray, gray brown, light gray, moderately dolomitic, argillaceous, slightly pyritic, platy siltstone with poor induration, and heavy dark gray argillaceous banding. Also present was up to 50 percent light to medium brown, light gray, very ﬁnely grained to silty, sub angular to sub rounded sandstone that was poorly to moderately sorted and poor to fair calcitic cementation. Samples transitioned to predominately siltstone following <br/>10,440 feet measured depth, marked by an increase in average gamma from the 45 to 60 to between 90 and 110 API range. Background gas averaged 250 units through the Middle Bakken. <br/>Lower Bakken 10,531 ’ MD 10,360’ TVD -8,.140’ SS <br/>Lower Bakken was picked at 10,531 feet measured depth; 10,360 feet true vertical depth, with a sharp increase in gamma, and transition of samples from siltstone to black, light to medium gray, tan gray, cream gray, off white, smooth to gritty carbonaceous shale, with trace to moderate light cream gray microcrystalline dolomite. Drill rates in the Lower Bakken averaged ,4 to 1 minutes per foot, with an average 500 units of background gas. </p>

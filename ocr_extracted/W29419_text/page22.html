    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">poor intercrystalline porosity, scattered pale greenish yellow ﬂuorescence, moderately rapid streaming foggy greenish yellow cut. <br/>LATERAL WELLBORE 10, 724’ MD -— 20,300’ MD <br/>Drilled out of casing at 10,724’ MD at 0845 hrs MST on 01 Dec 2014 and began dropping down in the target window. The ﬁrst part of the lateral was drilled in the Lower part of the target window with samples being mainly DOLOMI'IE: Light gray, light grayish brown, trace medium gray, light tan, microcrystalline, silty, arenaceous, very calcareous, sucrosic in part, abundantly platy w/no laminations, moderate induration, poor intercrystalline porosity; abundant shale from up hole; scattered pale yellow ﬂuorescence, very slow clear pale yellow cut. At 11500’ MD the bit dropped into the D facies and we had gamma heat up slightly to 110 api. We then worked on getting the bit back up into the target window. Formation dip at this point in the lateral was 90.7 to 90.8 degrees. Pason gas averaged 450 units of background gas. Then at 12200’ MD we got back up into the target window and had a formation dip of 9086 degrees. Then at 13850’ MD we dropped back down into the D facies and determined the formation dip had ﬂattened out to 90.0 degrees to 90.2 degrees. Then at 13900’ MD the formation began to drop at 89.5 to 89.7 degrees. Samples thr0ugh the middle part of the lateral were DOLOMITE Light grayish brown, light brown, trace off white, rnicrocrystalline, arenaceous, silty, calcareous, sucrosic in part, platy in part w/trace to no laminations, moderate induration, poor intercrystalline porosity; scattered pale greenish yellow ﬂuorescence, slow clear yellow cut. Background gas averaged 400 units with gas peaks of 600 units. The next part of the well we continued to track the CD contact drilling in and out of the target window. The bit entered the D facies at 16500’ MD and stayed there until 17600’ MD where it was determined that the formation was ﬂat to slightly up. The rest of the well was drilled in the target window with the last part drilled in the upper half of the target. The well reached total depth of 20,300’ MD at 1530 hrs MST 04 Dec 2014. <br/>CON CL USION <br/>The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation’s State 31-3-3H is a single lateral horizontal oil well targeting the Middle Bakken and is located in NWNE Section 3, T150N, R104W, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. It was spudded on 22 Nov 2014. The vertical wellbore reached TD of 9,800’ MD (9,807’ TVD). The curve wellbore reached TD at 10,724' MD; 10,383.99' TVD. 7” casing was set at 10,691.2’ MD. Total depth of 20,300‘ MD; 10,366.7' TVD; 10,058.38' VS reached at 1530 hrs MST 04 Dec. 2014. </p>

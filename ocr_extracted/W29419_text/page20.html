The Kibbey Lime marker was picked by the change in ROP and GR signature. ROP through the Kibbey averaged 0.9 minutes per foot (67 feet/hour). Backgron gas averaged 9 units and a peak reading of 13 units was recorded. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Kibbey Formation. <br/>A representative sample: <br/>LIMESTONE: Light tan, oﬁ‘ white to white, trace light brown, trace argillaceous, moderate induration, tight, scattered pale yellow ﬂuorescence, slow clear very pale yellow cut. <br/>Charles 8,246 ’ MD 8,243’ T VD -6,324’ SS </p>

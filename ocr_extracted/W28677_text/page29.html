Beds began dipping up around 12,600' MD and continued at around 902° to the third way-point of 13,400' MD / 10,391' TVD, which was reached within trough 4. Continued to follow trough 4 as beds continued to average around 902° through to the fourth way-point of 14,200' MD / 10,385' TVD. Moved up from trough 4 to peak 4 through to the ﬁfth way-point of 15,000' Ivﬂ) / 10,381' TVD. </p>

The formation began dipping up slightly as drilling continued to follow peak 3. Dropped down to the top of trough 4 at the eighth way-point of 17,400’1Vﬂ) / 10,375‘ TVD. Followed peak 3 as the formation continued to dip up around 90.1° through to the ninth way-point of 18,200' / 10,374' TVD. <br/>Moved up through trough 3 and into peak 2 following the formation to the tenth waypoint of 19,000' MD / 10,371' TVD. Just before reaching the eleventh way-point of 19,800' MD / 10,3 70' TVD the formation turned up sharply to around 90.8° from 19,600‘ to 19,900' MD. The bed dip ﬂattened out as the drill string moved up from trough 4 to peak 3, then back down to trough 3 before WPX Geology added a way-point at 20,400' MD in order to re—adjust the target window around the good drilling. The target window inclination was raised to 907° from 20,400' to 20,900' MD, with a centerline set at 10,3 58' TVD. Moved up through trough 2 and ended within peak 2 at the Target Depth. Reached the lateral TD of 21,375' MD at 2:30 PM CST on September 24th, 2014. </p>

    <p class="styleSans14.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">WPX Energy’s Roggenbuck 4-9HY reached the Target Depth of 21,3 75’ MD on September 24", 2014, at 2:30 PM CST. While building the curve, the landing target remained set at 10,385' TVD. The lateral section was drilled in a single run and averaged about 74.8' per hour, or around 1,797‘ of lateral drilling per day over the course of the lateral section. Well Site Geology was released just aﬁer 5 PM CST on September 24th, 2014, about 2 hours after the TD <br/>was reached. <br/>The Roggenbuck 4—9HY is currently awaiting completion. <br/>Ian Ramfjord Wellsite Geologist </p>

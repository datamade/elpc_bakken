    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Middle Bakken 10,884 ’ MD 10,2 70’ T VD -8,218 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken formation was encountered and picked by observing both a change in rock type from black Shale to cream/gray Limestone, and a rapid extreme drop in gamma API ﬁ'om over 400 API to 60 API. The Middle Bakken formation consisted of fairly porous, sub rounded, slightly argillaceous, gray to light tan Sandstone, calcitic cementation, interbedded platy laminated Siltstone, light ﬂuorescence, and slow thin streaming good cloudy cuts. <br/>Lower Bakken 10,950’ 1WD 10,310’ T VD -8,258’ SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale was entered at a depth of 10,950’ MD, 10,310’ TVD, which correlated a landing target of 10,379’ TVD. The Shale was identiﬁed by observing a rapid and extreme increase in gamma from 60 API to over 400 API. The Shale formation was conﬁrmed by collecting and identifying samples consisting of earthy, brittle, caibonaceous dark brown to black Shale, with trace light gray Limestone, no ﬂuorescence, and an instant streaming milky cut. <br/>Three Forks 11,024' MD 10,350' T VD -8,298' SS <br/>The Three Forks Formation was entered at a depth of 11,024’ MD, 10,3 50’ TVD, which correlated a landing target of 10,3 79’ TVD. The Three Forks formation was encountered and picked by observing both a change in rock type ﬁom black Shale to blue/gray Mudstone, and a gradual drop in gamma levels ﬁ'om over 400 API to 50 API. The upper section of the Three Forks Unit 6 consists of fairly tight, slightly calcareous, ﬁne grained gray to pale blue Siltstone, light ﬂuorescence, and a thin hazy cuts. The lower section of the Three Forks Unit 6 is primarily very ﬁne grained argillaccous pale blue/green to light gray Mudstone with poor/fair porosity, scattered translucent orange/light tan sucrosic Dolomite, faint ﬂuorescence, and weak hazy cuts. <br/>Lateral Section 10,313 ’ -— 21,3 75’ MD <br/>Drilled through the cement shoe and into the Three Forks formation, tested the MWD tool, ran a Formation Integrity Test (FIT), and proceeded to drill ahead laterally at 9 PM CST on September 18*, 2014. Began to drill ahead laterally through the Three Forks formation at an average of 0.5 minutes per foot, making slides as needed to maintain a 90° inclination to the ﬁrst way-point of 10,391' TVD at 11,800‘ MD. <br/>WPX has deﬁned the high and low gamma signatures as Peaks and Troughs labeled 1 through 4 in order to better communicate the current and desired positions within the formation. The Three Forks formation also contains 6 units, with unit 1 at the bottom and unit 6 at the top. Peak 1 is located at the top of unit 6, and Trough 4 is located at the bottom of unit 6. WPX has also implemented a 'do not cross' line located at the boundary between units 5 and 6, Since unit <br/>5 is to be treated like Shale, every effort has been taken to ensure that the drill-string stays within unit 6. </p>

Dropped down to peak 3 and into trough 3 before coming back up to peak 3 again for the second WPX way-point of 12,600‘ MD / 10,391' </p>

Then every third joint for a total of 17 centralizers. <br/>Casing string(s) will be pressure tested to 0.22 psi/foot of casing string length or 1,500 <br/>psi, whichever is greater (not to exceed 70% of the internal yield strength of the casing), after cementing and prior to drilling out from under the casing shoe. <br/>The 7” intermediate casing string has been designed for service in a sour gas (HZS) and salt environment. The intermediate casing has turbolizers on the bottom three (3) joints, then every other joint to 45 degrees. Centralizers were be used every other jt from 45 degrees to KOP, then every fourth joint to the top of the Dakota sands. <br/>B.

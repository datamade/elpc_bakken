Aﬁer seeing the False Bakken top the TVD landing target remained at a true vertical depth of 10,945’ @ 90 degrees based off the isopaching from the False Bakken to the Middle Bakken target area in the Skedsvold #21-4-5H and the Skedsvold #21—4—4H wells. Penetration rates through the False Bakken averaged around 80 - 90 ﬂ/hr while sliding and around 50 - 60 ﬁ/hr while rotating. The lithology of the False Bakken exhibited a mixture of light to medium gray limestone and traces of dark gray shale present. Background gases through the False Bakken increased to around 1600 —— 1800 units and the rotating head was installed. The False Bakken was evaluated while drilling ahead. </p>

Aﬁer seeing the Scallion top the TVD target window remained at a true vertical depth of 10,945’ @ 90 degrees based off the isopaching from the Scallion to the Three Forks target area in the Skedsvold #21-4-5H and the Skedsvold #21-4-4H wells. Penetration rates through the Scallion averaged around 80 - 90 ﬁ/hr while sliding and around 60 — 70 ﬁ/hr while rotating. Background gases increased to around 800 —— 950 units with the samples showing a light to medium <br/>gray/cream gray tan limestone with moderate dark gray to black shale present. The Scallion was drilled through from 10,907' to 10,917 ’ true vertical depth. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 11,115 ’ MD 10,91 7’ TVD -8,636’ SS <br/>The curve continued on through the remainder of the Scallion and the Upper Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,115’, true vertical depth of 10,917 ’, eight feet high to prognosis. After seeing the Upper Bakken Shale top the TVD landing target was lowered from 10,945’ TVD to 10,947’ TVD @ 90 degrees. Once the Upper Bakken was encountered penetration rates increased from 80 ﬁ/hr to around 90 100 mm while sliding and rotating. Background gases averaged around 1000 —— 1200 units through the Upper Bakken with the samples showing a black/brown black carbonaceous shale with occasional limestone present. The Upper Bakken was drilled through and the Middle Bakken was encountered. </p>

Penetration rates decreased in the Middle Bakken from around 100 ﬁlm to around 70 - 80 ﬁ/hr while sliding and rotating. The samples through the upper portion of the Middle Bakken exhibited a gray tan/gray brown dolomite with trace amounts of residual black shale and limestone present. Background gases through the Middle Bakken averaged around 700 — 800 units. Drilling continued on with the curve through the Middle Bakken up to a MD of 11,290'. The curve was landed </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">around 18’ in the middle portion of the Middle Bakken with 89.5 degrees projected to the bit. The curve for the South lateral was landed at a measured depth of 11,290’ at 4:15 pm. CDT on September 15, 2014 with 89.5 degrees projected to the bit at a true vertical depth of 10,946’. Casing for the South Lateral was set at 11,274’ MD. <br/>South Lateral 11,290’ — 20,510'MD Day 1 11,290’ — 11,630’ NID <br/>A Hunting mud motor and Hughes bit were used for the South Lateral. After ﬁnishing Rig repairs the TIH began until tagging cement where the cement, Float & Shoe and ﬁfteen feet of new formation were drilled to perform the FIT test. After ﬁnishing with the FIT test drilling resumed with the South lateral with casing exited at a MD of 11,274’ at 10:50 pm. CDT on September 18, 2014. The wellbore exited casing at around 86 degrees exiting the base of the Middle Bakken target interval and dropping about ten feet below the base of the target window with slides done for the planned directional turn and to work on keeping the wellbore at or slightly above the calculated dip rates of 90.1 degrees to continue bringing the wellbore up slowly in TVD back into the base of the Middle Bakken target interval. Penetration rates throughout the night averaged around 150 — 160 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 40 — 50 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 700 — 1100 units with connection gases reaching as high as 1903 units. The samples seen in the lower portion of the formation exhibited a cream gray tan/gray tan dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut with traces of limestone and siltstone present. <br/>Day 2 11,630’ —— 13,450’ MD <br/>Drilling continued with the South lateral with slides done throughout the morning to work on bringing the wellbore up in TVD back into the Middle Bakken target interval. Slides were also done throughout the day to ﬁnish up the planned directional turn which was complete aﬁer reaching an Azimuth of 180 degrees. Aﬁer bring the wellbore up in TVD back into the Middle Bakken target window the wellbore continued to track the middle to upper portion of the target interval throughout the day slowly building in TVD and seeing the upper warm rattier gamma indicating that the wellbore had exited the top of the target window. Slides were done after seeing this and the wellbore was leveled out and began to head back down section at around 88 degrees After entering the top of the target window the calculated dip reﬂected a change from 90.1 degrees to 90 degrees. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 120 — 140 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 30 — 50 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 400 — 700 units with connection gases reaching as high as 1953 units. The samples seen in the upper portion of the Middle Bakken exhibited a cream gray/cream gray tan dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a larger amount of limestone present in the samples. </p>

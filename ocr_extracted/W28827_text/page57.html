The top of the Mission Canyon was picked oﬁ‘ an increase in penetration rates as well as comparisons to the offsetting wells porosity benches throughout the Mission Canyon. Penetration rates throughout the upper portion of the Mission Canyon averaged around 50 - 60 ﬁ/hr with increases up to 70 ﬁlm seen throughout the different porosity benches. The samples throughout the upper 100' of the formation exhibited primarily a gray brown/gray tan limestone with trace to moderate anhydrite present and occasional dolomite mixed in. The remainder of the formation exhibited primarily limestone with trace amounts of cream to off-white anhydrite present. Background gases averaged around 60 — 120 units. The Mission Canyon formation was evaluated while drilling ahead. </p>

The Lodgepole formation was picked at the base of the lower Mission Canyon porosity as well as a sample change from a cream gray tan limestone to a cream gray/light to medium gray limestone. Penetration rates throughout the formation down to KOP averaged around 50 - 60 ﬁlm with <br/>background gases averaging around 90 - 110 units. KOP was reached at 7:15 am.

An 8 5/4” uugnes bit and 2.38 degree ﬁxed mud motor were used to build the curve. The landing target for the Skedsvold #21-4-3H at the beginning of the curve was set at 10,945’ @ 90 deg. based off the Lodgepole top and the ﬁrst LP marker. The Skedsvold #21-4—4H and the Skedsvold #21-4-5H were used for correlation purposes through the curve. Penetration rates at the beginning of the curve averaged around 80 - 100 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases through the Lodgepole formation averaged around 100 — 200 units until reaching the lower half of the Lodgepole where gases increased to around 1,000 — 1,500 units and continued to average around 500 — 700 units throughout the remainder of the Lodgepole. The lithology of the Lodgepole exhibited primarily a light to medium gray limestone with occasional anhydn'te and shale present. Gamma markers continued to consistently line up with the offset wells and the TVD landing target remained at 10,945’ TVD. The remainder of the Lodgepole formation was drilled out and the False Bakken was encountered </p>

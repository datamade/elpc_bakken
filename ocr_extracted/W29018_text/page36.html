    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Middle Bakken 11,051 ’ MD 10, 773’ TVD -8,587’ SS <br/>Gamma data marked the middle Bakken entry at measured depth 11,051 feet and true vertical depth of 10,773 feet. Returning samples of tan to light brown, often translucent dolomite veriﬁed entry into the targeted member of the Bakken formation. The clean dolomite lithology represented the upper half the target zone. Samples demonstrated good shows of petroleum in the form of dull but solid ﬂuorescence and slow, thin streams drawn out by added solvent. October 10‘“, 2014 at 10:30 am CT, the end of the curve was reached with a measured depth of 11,191 feet and true vertical depth of 10,790 feet. The landing placed the wellbore 17 vertical feet below the upper Bakken shale. <br/>Lateral Wellbore 11,1 91 ’— 20, 752 ’ MD <br/>All four of the parallel laterals in this sequence were designed with a heading of 180° south and required slide drilling to achieve their directional turn. The Mrachek 21-26-4H was unique in that the directional tum began within its curve segment while the others were turned entirely while drilling lateral. On October 27'“, 2014 drilling activity had returned to the Mrachek 21-25—4H to complete the 3rd of the 4 lateral segments. The assembly exited casing at 10:30 pm CT on the bottom line of an 8 foot target window still needing 50° of directional turn. The initial target had been projected at an estimated 897°. <br/>After 500 feet of lateral drilling, the wellbore had been brought to the center of the target window. Aﬂer a brief target change to 901°, the directional turn was completed and zone was lowered back to the initial 897°. The new target angle was to expire and proceed at 900° from measured depth 13,500 feet based on formational trends seen on the previous laterals and anticipated to appear in this one as well. Throughout this interval, the lithology matched the dolomite expected high within zone and seen in the adjacent laterals. Petroleum shows in the drill cuttings were strong from the start in the form of ﬂuorescence and cut. Gas values made an impressive increase at around measured depth 13,000 to an average of 2,000 total units. <br/>Out to measured depth 15,000 feet the wellbore had been tracking the top half of zone and often high to the top line of the 8 foot window. This interval had also maintained the impressive gas values started two thousand feet earlier and was the same lithology of dolomite with strong shows of petroleum. Several target changes were made in attempt to catch the <br/>expected formational turn upward. Although numerous, the changes were typically less than a 5 foot vertical shift and short lived. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Approaching measured depth 18,000 feet, the anticipated formational change still had not occurred and the target was projected at an estimated 900°. Clean, tan dolomite still dominated samples with good petroleum shows and gas values had been maintaining a 2,000 total unit average. A dramatic increase in the assembly inclination to over 930° concluded with an inevitable strike with the upper Bakken shale at measured depth 18,252 feet. A trip out of the hole began on October 30"], 2014 at 1:15 pm CT. An inspection of the tools at the surface provided no explanation for the unusual inclination. The upper Bakken shale had been encountered within one foot of the true vertical depth that it was expected at based on the current target, </p>

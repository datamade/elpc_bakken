    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The top of the Lodgepole formation was identiﬁed at 10,023 feet measured depth and 9,966 feet, true vertical depth, also with the aid of gamma data. Since the LP top came in close to where it had been expected with respect to the 2 previous holes, the true vertical depth landing target was maintained at 10,788 feet. <br/>Curve 10,275’—11,191’MD <br/>After identifying the Lodgepole formation on October 8th, 2014 at 1:10 am CT, the kick oﬁ‘ point was reached with a measured depth 10,275 feet. A trip to surface for curve building tools was completed and drilling of the curve began later the same day at 12:05 pm CT high within the Lodgepole Formation. Low build rates forced a trip out of the hole at measured depth 10,670 on the same night. Shortly before the trip to surface, a signiﬁcant kick of gas was recorded. The initial readings reached 3,200 feet and tapered down to 1,990 over the course of measured depths 10,590 to 10,630 within the Lodgepole formation. Drilling of the curve resumed with a more aggressive assembly on October 9tll at 7:05 am CT. <br/>Lithology of the Lodgepole consisted of light brown to gray brown, slightly argillaceous, and occasionally dolomitic limestone. Petroleum shows of the Lodgepole were steady and generally moderate. Dull to pinpoint ﬂuorescence, and occasional weak streams of petroleum were visible when cut with solvent. Gas values seen from the formation averaged 800 total units. The high average due to the impressive kick previously noted. <br/>False Bakken 1 0, 968 ’ MD 10, 748 ’ TVD -8, 5 62 ’ SS <br/>Consistent with the previous curves landed, a thin proﬁle and high angle when drilled, the False Bakken yielded no sample. The False Bakken top and bottom were determined entirely by gamma signature. At this depth, gas values began to increase from a background value of 150 total units. <br/>Scallion 10,974’ MD 10, 750’ TVD -8,564’ SS <br/>Cuttings from the lagged depth of the Scallion were identiﬁed as gray to light gray limestone lacking any visible intercrystalline porosity despite streaming petroleum when introduced to solvent. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 11,002 ’ MD 10, 758’ TVD -8,5 72 ’ SS <br/>Blocky, tightly packed, black shale reached surface shortly aﬁer the top of the Bakken was identiﬁed by gamma data. The true vertical depth of 10,758 feet that the top of the Bakken formation came in at continued to verify the original target of 10,788 feet. Strong shows of residual petroleum were seen as total gas values stopped climbing just under 5,000 units. </p>

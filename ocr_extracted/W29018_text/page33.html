The course of the wellbore would track the target zone at an azimuth of 180°. This well is located along state highway 200, 5 miles northwest of Alexander, North Dakota in the NE NW Section 26 T151N R102W. The bottom hole coordinates of the Mrachek 21-26-4H are located 299’ FSL & 1,581 ’ FEL in the SW SE ‘/4 of Section 35 T151N R102W. <br/>This well was spud on September 25‘”, 2014. Well site geological services began at measured depth 9,000 feet, within the Charles formation. One hour, ten foot, thirty foot, and fiﬁy foot lagged samples were caught by roughnecks, geologist/mud loggers and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Surface of the well was drilled using salt water brine and a 13.5 inch bit. Casing measuring 9 5/8” in diameter was set in cement at 2,259 feet measured/true vertical depth. The vertical wellbore, and curve were then both drilled using petroleum based invert mud. An eight and three quarter inch wellbore was drilled to the end of the curve tangent and intermediate 7” casing was set at 11,182 feet measured depth. The approximately 10,000 foot lateral was drilled with a six inch bit using saltwater based drilling ﬂuid. Gas monitoring equipment was provided by Neset Consulting Services, using a Total Gas system. <br/>Vertical wellbore <br/>Logging depth of 9,000 feet was reached early in the morning of October 7“, 2014 at 12: 15 am CT. It was the third vertical and curve segment to be drilled on the location in a four well series. The initial true vertical depth target of 10,788 feet was in agreement with values seen drilling the three adjacent Mrachek wells and leﬁ unchanged. <br/>Base of Last Charles Salt 9,290’ MD 9,234 ’ TVD -7,048’ SS <br/>With respect to the previous wells drilled, the Last Charles Salt was at the expected depth reinforcing the prognosis target of 10,788 feet, true vertical depth. Cuttings from the Charles were primarily translucent and blocky salt with layers of anhydrite and minor amounts of limestone. The base of the last Charles Salt was picked using samples and a decreased rate of penetration at 9,234 feet, true vertical depth. Petroleum shows in the Charles were weak in samples and gas values. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,514 ’ 1WD 9,45 7’ TVD -7,271 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Mission Canyon formation was identiﬁed at measured depth 9,514 feet, and true vertical depth of 9,457 feet, with the advantage of gamma data and was also seen in sample and rate of penetration data. Sampled cuttings represented a large bed of limestone, altered to dolomite at the top and ranged in colors of tan, brown, light brown, gray to dark gray. Limestone samples were crystalline to microcrystalline, argillaceous with little to no porosity. </p>

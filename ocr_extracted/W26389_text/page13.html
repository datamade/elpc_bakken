Black arrows connect the preliminary pad and CTB locations to their actual staked and/or permitted surface location and red arrows point to the new pads. Blue lines represent MB wells and yellow lines represent TF wells added to the Development Plan. <br/>Please refer to Exhibits “A”, “B” and “C” for the following modiﬁcations to the Development Plan thru the second quarter of 2013: <br/>Pad A was initially a dual-well pad located in the SW/4 of Section 19, Tl47N—R95W. This pad was converted to a tri-well pad to include additional TF wells and was moved south to the NW/4 of Section 30, T147N-R95W to accommodate landowner concerns. Pad A includes the CCU Prairie Rose 11—30TFH, CCU Meriwether 14-19TFH, and CCU Meriwether 14—19MBH wells and was constructed in 2012. The CCU Meriwether 14-19MBH is currently being drilled. <br/>Pad B was initially a tri-well pad located in the SE/4 of Section 19, T147N-R95W. This pad was converted to a quad-well pad to include additional TF wells and was moved southwest to the NW/4 of Section 30, T147N-R95W to accommodate landowner concerns. Pad B includes the CCU Prairie Rose 31~30TFH, CCU Prairie Rose 21-30MBH, CCU Meriwether 24-19MBH, and CCU Meriwether 24-19TFH wells and was constructed in 2012. The CCU Meriwether 2419TFH is currently being drilled. <br/>Pad C is a new dual-well pad proposed in the NE/4 of Section 30, T147N-R95W. This pad includes the CCU Prairie Rose 31-3 0MBH and CCU Meriwether 34-19TFH which will be the ﬁrst two wells drilled by the third CCU rig. Burlington anticipates commencing drilling operations with this new rig by the end of the ﬁrst quarter in 2013. The rig arrival was delayed by a combination of rig availability and permitting. <br/>Pad D is a dual-well pad located in the SE/4 of Section 19, T147N—R95W and includes the CCU Meriwether 44-19MBH and CCU Meriwether 44—19TFH wells drilled in 2012. There were no changes to this pad from the Development Plan. <br/>Pad E was initially a dual-well pad located on the border of Sections 29 and 30, T147N-R95W. This pad was converted to a tri-well pad to include additional TF wells and was moved northeast to the NW/4 of Section 29, Tl47N-R95W to minimize surface disturbance. Pad E includes the CCU Prairie Rose 41-30MBH, CCU Powell ll-29MBH, and CCU Powell 11—29TFH, wells drilled in 2012. <br/>Pad F is a new tri-well pad proposed in the NW/4 of Section 29, T147N-R95W. The pad includes the CCU William 24-20TFH, CCU William 24-20MBH, and CCU William 34-20TF H wells scheduled for drilling in 2013. <br/>Pad G is a dual-well pad located in the NE/4 of Section 29, Tl47N—R95W and includes the CCU Powell 21—29MBH and CCU Powell 21-29TFH wells drilled in 2012. This pad was moved slightly to the east to minimize surface disturbance and includes an additional TF well. <br/>Pad H was initially a tri—well pad located in the NE/4 of Section 28, Tl47N—R95W. This pad was moved north to the SE/4 of Section 21, Tl47N-R95W to minimize surface disturbance. Pad H includes the CCU Corral Creek 41-28MBH, CCU Corral Creek 41-28TFH, CCU Four Aces 442lMBH, and CCU Four Aces 44—21TFH wells scheduled for drilling in 2013. <br/>Page 2 of 6 Corral Creek - Bakken Unit 01-2013 <br/>  </p>

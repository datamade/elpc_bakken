    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Dear Mr. Helms, <br/>During a conference call on January 7, 2013, Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Company LP (‘Burlington’), as operator of the Corral Creek — Bakken Unit (‘CCU’) located in T147N-R94W and T147N-R95W in Dunn County, ND, agreed to submit quarterly updates to the North Dakota Industrial Commission (‘NDIC’) for modiﬁcations to the supplemental ‘Exhibits 17-23’ titled, “Preliminary Lost Bridge Unit 3 Rig Development Plan” (‘Development Plan”), which were submitted to the NDIC on October 12, 201] and made a part ofCase Nos. 1533?. and 15333. <br/>Initially, the Development Plan only assumed Middle Bakken (‘MB’) drilling and provided for additional Three Forks (‘TF’) drilling based on the outcome of future studies. However, production from the Three Forks Formation (15‘ Bench) has been fully delineated in and around CCU within the last few years suggesting economic development over the Corral Creek Unit. Three Forks wells have now been fully <br/>incorporated into the CCU Development Plan. <br/>Burlington recently initiated an increased density spacing pattern for the CCU Pulhnan wells with laterals in Sections 6 &7, T147N-R95W. Burlington may also extend this well spacing to other portions of the Corral Creek Unit subject to further evaluation. <br/>The CCU drilling schedule has been, and may continue to be, aﬁected by facility limitations, topographic and construction issues, rig moves, and restrictions for seasonal operations inside and adjacent to the Little Missouri State Park. All pad and facility sites in the Development Plan were initial projections subject to change. Burlington has made eﬂ‘orts to accommodate landowner and other stakeholder <br/>concerns, by minimizing surface disturbances, consolidating wells to multi—well pads, and by reducing ﬂaring wherever possible. Additionally, all wells are now batch drilled unless otherwise noted. <br/>These quarterly updates are intended to provide the NDIC with advanced notice of permit applications and modiﬁcations to the Development Plan for CCU and will not be ﬁnalized until permits are approved <br/>and well pads are built. </p>

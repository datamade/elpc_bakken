As the wellbore entered the target window the A to C faces was seen indicating that the formation had ﬂattened slightly giving the formation a new calculated dip of 90. 11 degrees. Drilling continued throughout the night with the wellbore steadily tracking the middle to lower portion of the Middle Bakken target interval. Penetration rates with the new assembly averaged around 120 — 140 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 15 ~ 20 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 600 — 700 units. The samples seen from the Middle Bakken target interval continued to exhibit a cream gray tan/cream gray dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut with traces of limestone and siltstone present. </p>

As sliding continued throughout the day the wellbore steadily tracked the lower portion of the target window seeing the slightly warmer gamma from the C to D faces contact. Drilling continued with the asscmbly slowly building in rotary through the target window seeing the cleaner gamma in the upper portion of the target from the C face giving the formation a calculated dip rate of 90.29 degrees. Drilling continued through the target window with slides done to slow the build of the assembly leveling the wellbore out in the upper portion of the Middle Balcken target window. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 110 — 120 ft/hr while rotating and around 15 — 20 Win while sliding. Background gases averaged around 700 — 800 units. </p>

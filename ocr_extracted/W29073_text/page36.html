CDT on August 30, 2014 with 90 degrees projected to the bit at a true vertical depth of 10,948’. Casing for the South Lateral was set at 11,218’ MD. <br/>South Lateral 11,238 ’ - 22,130' MD Day 1 11,238’ — 12,350’ MD <br/>A Hunting mud motor and Reed bit were used for the South Lateral. The TIH began until tagging cement where the cement, Float & Shoe and ten feet of new formation were drilled to perform the FIT test. Aﬁer ﬁnishing with the FIT test drilling resumed with the South lateral with casing exited at a MD of 11,218’ at 9:00 am. CDT on October 12, 2014. Drilling continued with the wellbore dropping in TVD through the Middle Bakken at around 88 degrees and continued to drop down section until being leveled out about ﬁve feet below the base of the Middle Bakken target window. Slides were done throughout the day to keep the wellbore pointed up and to work on the planned directional turn. The wellbore built in TVD throughout the day and entered the base of the Middle Bakken target interval seeing the C/D contact giving the formation a calculated dip rate of 90 degrees and continued to build with the wellbore reaching the middle portion of the Middle Bakken target window. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 140 — 150 ﬁlm while rotating and around 40 - 50 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 200 — 250 units with connection gases reaching as high as 741 units. The samples seen in the lower portion of the formation exhibited a cream gray tan/cream gray dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Day 2 12,350’ — 13,600’ MD <br/>Drilling continued with slides done throughout the day to continue working on the planned 85 degree directional turn. As drilling continued with the S lateral the wellbore continued to track the Middle Bakken target interval building slowly in TVD reaching the upper portion of the target window. As the upper three feet of the target was reached the upper clean gamma bench was seen. This repeat of clean gamma indicated that the formation had steepened slightly from 90.1 to 90.15 degrees. Penetration rates averaged around 140 — 150 ft/hr while rotating and aron 40 — 50 ft/hr while sliding. Backgron gases averaged around 200 — 400 units with connection gases reaching as high as 2,159 units. The samples seen throughout the Middle Bakken target window exhibited a Cream gray/Cream gray tan dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Day 3 13,600’ —- 15,200’1llD <br/>Drilling continued through the target interval with slides done to continue worldng on the planned directional turn which was completed after reaching 180 degrees. Aﬁer reaching 180 degrees surveys returned to every ninety feet or stand down. As slides were done throughout the day the wellbore steadily tracked the lower half of the Middle </p>

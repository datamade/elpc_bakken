Throughout the night the wellbore began to build in TVD reaching the upper portion of the target window seeing the upper clean gamma bench before reaching and exiting the top of the Middle Bakken target window seeing our repeat section in gamma from the C to A contact. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 120 — 140 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 30 - 4O ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 400 — 600 units with connection gases reaching as <br/>high as 2,593 units. The samples seen continued to exhibit a cream gray tan/gray tan dolomite. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling continued with the wellbore exiting the top of the Middle Bakken target window with slides done to work on leveling the wellbore out to begin working on dropping the wellbore in TVD back into the Middle Bakken target interval. The wellbore reached about four to ﬁve feet above the top of the target window with slides done leveling the wellbore out and beginning to head down section at 88 to 89 degrees. As the wellbore entered the top of the target window and the A/C repeat the new calculated dip was set at 90.17 degrees. The assembly continued to drop in TVD towards the lower portion of the target interval and continued to track the Middle Bakken target window throughout the day. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 110 - 120 ﬂ/hr while rotating and around 20 - 30 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 600 — 700 units. The samples seen throughout the target window continued to exhibit a cream gray/gray tan dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut with traces of limestone and siltstone present. <br/>Day 5 17,150’-—18,322’MD <br/>Drilling continued on through the target window with the wellbore steadily building in rotary around 91 degrees exiting the top of the Middle Bakken target window. Upon exiting the top of the target the C to A faces transition was seen and slides were done to work on slowing the build of the assembly avoiding the Upper Bakken Shale. As the wellbore would roll over and begin heading down section it would deﬂect off of the hard streak about one foot above the top of the target window. While putting in slides to begin heading down section at a steeper angle of 88 degrees problems were experienced with the Mud Motor and the decision was made to TOOH. The TOOH began with 12.5# kill mud pumped at the shoe before continuing out of the hole. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 100 — 120 ft/hr while rotating and around 20 — 3O ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 700 — 800 units. <br/>Day 6 18,322’ — 19,150’ MD <br/>The TOOH was completed with a new Bit, Mud Motor and MWD tool picked up. The TIH began with a shallow test performed on the MWD tool before continuing in the hole circulating out kill mud at the shoe. The TIH continued to bottom where trip gases were circulated out of the hole reaching as high as 3,569 with a 15’ to 20’ ﬂare seen. Drilling resumed with the S lateral with slides done to continue working on dropping the </p>

A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Light gray brown, medium gray, cream gray, wackestone to packstone, slightly argillaceous, ANHDRITE: 20% cream gray, white, gummy, poor to moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered dull yellow ﬂuorescence, good cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Rival 9,992 ’ MD 9, 981 ’ TVD - 7,328 ’ SS <br/>The Rival Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,992’ and a true vertical depth of 9,981 ’, which was one foot higher than the prognosis. The Rival was picked using gamma signatures and lithology changes. The samples in the upper portion of the Rival were as follows; LIMESTONE: Gray, medium to dark gray brown, light brown, micritic to packstone, slightly argillaceous, carbonaceous in part, 10% off white anhydrite, poor to moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, spotty dull yellow white ﬂuorescence, fair cloudy yellow <br/>cut. </p>

The Lodgepole Formation was picked from using gamma signatures along with a lithology changes. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Light to medium gray, light gray brown, off white, wackestone to packstone, argillaceous, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered yellow white ﬂuorescence, cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Curve 10,900— 11,710’MD <br/>The curve was started at a kick off point of 10,900’ measured depth, 370’ below the Lodgepole. The bit and bottom hole assembly were changed out for a directional assembly at 10,900’ measured depth for drilling the curve. Penetration rate of the curve averaged 105’per <br/>hour. The Curve was landed on January 10, 2015 at 11:30 AM. CST 16’ into the Middle Bakken Formation at a tme vertical depth 0f11,416.39’. Casing was completed on January 12, 2015. </p>

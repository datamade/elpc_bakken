Samples consisted solely of sandstone. A typical sample was as follows; SANDSTONE: Light to medium gray, dark brown gray, dark gray, translucent to clear, ﬁne to very ﬁne grained, well sorted, subrounded to subangular, calcareous, dolomitic, argillaceous, poor to fair intergranular porosity, fair light oil staining, 40% Siltstone, medium to dark gray, friable, slightly argillaceous, dolomitic, faint even yellow green ﬂuorescence, bright yellow green cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.2-6.0 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 6-4,933 units. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The start of the curve was kicked off at 10,050’ MD. Drilling times in the curve below the kick off point were between 0.2-6.1 minutes per foot sliding/rotating. Gas varied between 281,044 units. Gamma markers, as well as lagged samples, were utilized throughout the Lodgepole, False Bakken, Upper Bakken, and Middle Bakken to correlate TVD (true vertical depth) footage values to the nearest offset wells. The curve was landed at 12:30 AM CDT on October 23, 2014 at a measured depth of 10,869 feet and a true vertical depth of 10,544.62 feet. This was 1.38 feet above the revised target prognosis of 10,546’ TVD. Seven inch 35# weight casing was set to a measured depth of 10,843 feet and cement ﬁlled the remainder of the wellbore down to the curve <br/>landing measured depth of 10,869 feet. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The EN-Fretheim A-155—93-3334 H-5 reached a target depth of 21,853’ measured depth on November 18, 2014 at 1:15 AM CST. The projection to bit was 3.58’ above the ideal target line. The wellbore, for the majority of the lateral, deviated +/- 2—6 feet in true vertical depth ﬁ‘om <br/>the Middle Bakken target line. </p>

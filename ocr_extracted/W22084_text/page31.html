Upon separation of the mineral and surface rights, two estates exist “which are as distinct as if they contained two parcels of land.” Slaaten, 748 F.2d at 1277. <br/>Generally, when a mineral estate is severed from the surface estate, the mineral estate is dominant and the surface estate is servient. Hunt Oil Co. v. Kerbaugh, 283 N.W.2d 131, 135 (N .D. 1979). The mineral estate is dominant in that the law implies a legitimate area within which mineral ownership of necessity carries with it inherent surface rights to ﬁnd and develop the minerals, which rights must and do involve the surface estate. Hunt, 283 N.W.2d at 135. <br/>In 1973, the North Dakota Supreme Court adopted the general rule that, in the absence of other rights expressly granted or reserved, the owner of the mineral estate has the right to make use of as much of the surface estate as is reasonably necessary to explore, develop, remove and transport the minerals. Christman v. Emineth, 212 N.W.2d 543, 550 (N .D. 1973). Under a usual oil and gas lease then, the lessee, in developing the leased premises, is entitled to use of the land reasonably necessary to developing and producing the product. Hunt, 283 N.W.2d at 135 (citing Feland v. Placid Oil Co., 171 N.W.2d 829, 834 (ND. 1969)). The lessee acquires a “working interest” in the mineral estate which is a real property interest. Slaaien, 748 F.2d at 1277. The “working interest” gives the mineral lessee the exclusive right to develop the minerals conveyed <br/>in the lease. Id. <br/>The mere granting of the lease creates and vests in the lessee the dominant estate in the surface of the land for purposes of the lease. Feland, 171 N.W.2d at 834. By implication, the lease grants the lessee the use of the surface to the extent necessary to fully enjoy the mineral estate. Id. Without such rights, the mineral estate would be meaningless and worthless. Id. <br/>The mineral estate has no right, however, to use more of, or do more to, the surface estate than is reasonably necessary to carry out the lessee’s operations. Hunt, 283 N.W.2d at 135. In North Dakota, the use of the surface estate is subject to (1) the reasonable use doctrine; (2) the accommodation doctrine; and (3) the Oil and Gas Production Compensation Act. Even though the mineral estate is generally the dominant estate, a lessee must still make reasonable use of the surface estate and consider all alternatives prior to commencing any operation on the surface estate. If alternatives exist, a balancing of the mineral and surface owners’ interest occurs. Id. at <br/>137. </p>

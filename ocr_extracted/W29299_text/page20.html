Between the landing target and Way Point 1, drilling also involved sliding to make an azimuth turn from approximately 307 degrees to approximately 319 degrees, which was accomplished near 11,100’ MD. Also within Way Point 1, a round trip for MWD tool occurred in the aftemoon of December 20, 2014 at 10,623’ MD, with resumption of drilling in the very early morning of December 21, 2014. After the GR Marker was encountered, with the bit rising above the GR Marker, Way Point 1 was adjusted and created Way Point 2, which began at 11,800’ MD with a target window of 9,430 — 9,442’ TVD, and ended at 12,000’ MD with a target window of 9,437 - 9,449’ TVD. The GR Marker was encountered for <br/>the second and third times at 10,666’ MD/-7,430’ SS, and 11,397’ MD/-7,434’ SS, respectively. <br/>GR Marker 10,666’ MD 9,434 ’ TVD -7,430’ SS GR Marker 11,39 7’ MD 9,438 ’ T VD -7,434’ SS <br/>The third section of the horizontal was drilled to Way Point 3, set at 14,000’ MD, with a target window of 9,440 — 9,452’ TVD. The GR Marker was encountered for the <br/>fourth and ﬁfth times at 12,860’ MD/-7,435’ SS, and 13,262’ MD/-7,437’ SS, respectively. <br/>GR Marker 12, 860’ MD 9,439 ’ TVD -7,435 ’ SS <br/>GR Marker 13,262’ MD 9,441 ’ TVD -7,43 7’ SS The fourth and ﬁnal horizontal section of Parshall 97-3332H was drilled to Way <br/>Point 4, set at 15,700’ MD, with a target window of 9,443 — 9,455’ TVD. The GR <br/>Marker was encountered for the sixth and seventh times at 15,032’ MD/-7,439’ SS, and <br/>15,294’ MD/-7,440’ SS, respectively. Within Way Point 4, TD was reached at 15,656’ <br/>MD at 2:00 PM CST on December 22, 2014. All Way Points were published by company geologist Tony Rios of ECG Resources. <br/>GR Marker 15,032 ’ MD 9,443 ’ TVD - 7,439 ’ SS <br/>GR Marker 15,294 ’ IUD 9,444 ’ TVD -7,440’ SS </p>

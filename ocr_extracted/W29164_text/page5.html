    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Lithology made several color transitions as wellbore moved down, through basal Clean gamma and then back up into geologic zone, helping conﬁrm gamma correlations and overall wellbore position in the geologic zone. Samples typically showed light blue gray to light gray brown dolomite with dull blue yellow ﬂuorescence and a slow weak cut. Through most of the lateral, total gas typically averaged around 300 — 800 units with slight increases at connections. Well was drilled at an average inclination of 90.3 degrees with target inclination averaging 90.24 degrees. Average formation dip for the entire lateral was estimated to be 90.28 degrees, even though formation averaged 90.44 degrees for the majority of the lateral. Average formation dip was 0.01 degrees above the original anticipated dip of 90.27 degrees. Upon reaching total depth of the lateral it was estimated well was drilled 55% in zone. <br/>Jared Bryl Thomas Osadc/zuk Wei/site Geologists </p>

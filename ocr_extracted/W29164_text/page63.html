While breaking in the motor, penetration rates were held to under 100 ft/hr while rotating. Frequent slides were done to build the azimuthal turn needed to begin heading to the north. Initial wellbore inclination coming out of easing was much lower than originally thought causing wellbore to drop out the bottom of the target window. <br/>Continuing to drill ahead, wellbore inclination increased and well moved up in formation and back through the Basal Clean gamma. Over the next 500’ MD well continued to move up in fonnation and above Basal Clean marker, which appeared to be just below center of target window. Samples made minimal color changes as well entered, passed through and exited the Basal Clean. Samples typically showed at light blue gray to light brown, pyritic, Dolomite. Initial correlations suggested formation dip was slightly toe-up around 90.05 — 90.1 degrees. <br/>Continuing to drill ahead with wellbore gradually drifting down towards the center of target window, a hard streak was encountered deﬂecting the well back up. Even though hard steak was approximately in the center of the target window no changes to target were made. Penetrations rates averaged 150 — 190 ft/hr, gamma averaged 80 — 120 API with frequent ﬂuctuations and total gas averaged 250 — 400 units. Correlations were still poor to fair, suggesting a formation dip of 90.0 — 90.2 degrees. <br/>Over the next several hundred feet wellbore remained mostly ﬂat in the upper half of the target window. This suggested well was at approximate dip of formation, which was estimated to be 90.0 — 90.1 degrees. During this time penetration rates averaged 250 — 320 ft/hr. Gamma averaged 80 — 110’s API with very little ﬂuctuation and total gas averaged 200 — 450 units with slight increases at connections. Samples made very little change and typically consisted of a light brown to light gray brown pyritic Dolomite. While drilling past 13,300’ MD, wellbore inclination decreased and began to move down through the target window. The Basal Clean gamma marker was contacted near the center of the target window. This confirmed that current target was still ideal and no changes were needed. <br/>Continuing to drill past 14,000’ MD, wellbore continued to move down in formation to the bottom of the target window. Inclination had just started to ﬂatten, when it appeared as if formation pulled the wellbore down. This resulted in well going through the bottom of the Basal Clean gamma and out the bottom of the geologic zone of interest. Samples transitioned from a light blue gray to light tan to eventually a light brown pyritic Dolomite. Correlation quality drastically improved as well past through Basal Clean marker conﬁrming wellbores exact position in the geologic zone of interest. Latest correlation suggested formation had rolled over and was now toe-down at from 89.6 — 89.7 degrees. No changes to target were made, since this down dip was anticipated and was expected to be short term. Over the next 500’ MD wellbore inclination was gradually ﬂattened and increased, before starting to move back up in formation. While out the bottom of the geologic zone of interest, penetration rates were unexpectedly good </p>

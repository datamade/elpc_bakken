Waterbars should not be constructed in locations that will cause water to drain on fill slopes. <br/>F. Winter Freeze-up: In the event of winter freeze-up, reclamation will be put- on hold as determined by the Forest Service. <br/>G. Contaminated Soils: Upon request, the Operator shall test areas that have been subject to previous spills and/or saturation from wastes to determine hydrocarbon and salt concentrations, chemical additives, minerals, and/or other substances as necessary. Test results will be made available to the Forest Service. Contaminated soils shall be promptly treated prior to any reclamation. Treatment methods and/or plans must be approved prior to treatment. <br/>H. Topsoil: It is advantageous to the Operator to conduct a joint site survey in advance, with the Forest Service, to determine all available topsoil quantity. Topsoil shall be stripped where disturbance will occur and be deposited in a pile apart from other excavated material to reduce potential mixing with subsoil material. After the desired amount of material has been removed, and the resulting slopes and ditches (cuts and fills) have been shaped and smoothed as required, the stockpiled topsoil shall be evenly spread over exposed subsoil to the extent practicable. <br/>During production reclamation, not all topsoil may be used. Excess topsoil is to be piled, seeded and protected until final reclamation occurs. Excess topsoil will not be removed from the site for any other uses. When final reclamation occurs, the topsoil used during production reclamation will be stripped and used with the excess topsoil for final reclamation. <br/>Topsoil shall not be stripped from the general construction right-of—way for pipelines and/or flowlines. Topsoil shall be stripped from areas requiring excavation for level working surface such <br/>as side slopes and creek crossings. <br/>During final reclamation, if the site is short of topsoil, the Operator shall import an adequate amount of certified weed seed free clean topsoil to meet the reclamation requirements. A written certification report shall be submitted to and approved by the Forest Service prior to use. <br/>I. Roads: During construction after grading is completed and before applying revegetation measures, areas to be revegetated shall be raked or otherwise cleared of sticks, stumps, stones, and other debris, which might interfere with sowing of seed, growth of grasses, or subsequent maintenance of grass covered areas. If any damage by erosion or other causes occurs after the completion of grading and before beginning the revegetation work, the Operator shall repair such damages. This shall include filling gullies, smoothing irregularities, and repairing other incidental damage. Immediately in advance of the seeding, any crusted surface shall be scarified at right angles to the slope plane. <br/>J. Pipelines and Flowlines and Trenched Electric Lines: Pipeline and/or flowline and/or trenched electric line reclamation outside the Area of Operations must be completed by the end of </p>

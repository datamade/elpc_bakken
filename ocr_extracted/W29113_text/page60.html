These rates were derived using three basic figures: percent of each species desired by composition, number of seeds per pound according to species, and total number of PLS per square foot. <br/>- The following equation should be used to calculate how much seed is needed to provide the required pounds of PLS needed. <br/>0/.

All seed sources should be derived from loal collections or a general area extening 300 miles north and 200 miles south of the area to be reclaimed, and within similar elevation and precipatulon zones as western North Dakota, ie from Jamestown on the east to Billings, MT on the west. <br/>A local source for forbs is Prairies Diversified located in Bismarck, ND (Roger Rostvet, 701-258-0181). Other sources may be used but they must be verified as local collections and not obtained from a <br/>distant source that are distributed by a local dealer. Seeding depth should be one-half inch or less for drilled seed. <br/>For broadcast seeding, multiply pounds of each species seeded by 1.5. Seed bed should be thoroughly worked and firm. <br/>Best average seeding dates for cool and warm season mixes is May — June. Earlier of later (fall dormant) seeding is likely to result in poor establishment of warm season species and is therefore discouraged. <br/>Seed mix may need to be adjusted due to site characteristics and/or lack of available seed for some species. In the latter case, adjust species seeding rates by formulas below table to obtain approximately 50 seed per square foot and/or 12-16 lbs. of PLS per acre for drilled seed and 18-24 lbs. per acre for broadcast seeding. <br/>Note: The following are required as per Conditions of Approval #28 B, Certification & Reporting 1. Report of Seeding (#37-28B) 2. Certification of Seed Mixture from Seed Company and seed tags from bags or copy of seed tags for all planted material must be submitted to the appropriate Medora or McKenzie Ranger Districts. <br/>Call the appropriate Medora or McKenzie Ranger Districts if there are any questions. <br/>- Medora Ranger District: 701-227-7800. - McKenzie RangerDistrict: 701-842-2393. </p>

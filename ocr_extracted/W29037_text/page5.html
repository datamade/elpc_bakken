The Salem 4-6H is a horizontal well targeting the Middle Bakken Porosity, crossing section 6 and 7. The Salem 4-6H well was spud on September 20‘“, 2014 and drilling was completed on October 24‘“, 2014. Lateral #1 was drilled to a TD of 20,744’ MD. The surface location was set at 355' FNL & 2,088‘ FWL, with lateral #1 ending coordinates of 230.75' FNL & 1,992.87' FWL of section 7 and -9,976.25' N—S & —95.l3' E-W from the surface location. Joseph Magnan and, Dennis Corwin, of Neset Consulting Service, provided mudlogging and geological services beginning on September 25th, 2014 in the vertical hole at 9,200’ MD in the Top Charles formation through TD at 20,744’ MD in the Middle Bakken Member. Noram Gas Detection Services were utilized throughout the vertical, curve, and horizontal part of the well. Thirty and One Hundred foot lagged samples were caught, washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Sample quality was poor to good during the well. Oil and gas shows were poor to fair while in zone. </p>

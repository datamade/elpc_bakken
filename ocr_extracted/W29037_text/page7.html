    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">AM., CST. A max trip gas of 1733 units was seen. The samples once they drilled out consisted Limestone: Light brown, tan, light gray, ﬁrm, silty, microcrystalline, carbonaceous, slightly dolomitic, fair intercrystalline porosity; even dull yellow/green ﬂuorescence, faint streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was around 0.41 min/ﬂ, and the background gases averaged 237 units with a max of 776 units. While in the target window the gamma averaged between high 60’s to mid 80’s API. The gamma API seen at a maker near the top of the target window averaged between Low 80’s to High 90’s API.The top of the target window was encountered at 11,375' MD, 10,966.4' TVD, showing an 88.77 degree dip. The plan was to drill ahead at an estimated 89.5 degrees. <br/>From 13,000’ MD to 15,000’ MD, the rate of penetration averaged 0.41 min/ﬂ. The background gases averaged 203 units with a max of 337 units. Continued to follow an estimated dip of 89.5 until 13,000 MD then the dip was changed to 89.4 degrees. The bit went out the top of the target window at 14979' MD, 11,001.21' TVD, verifying an 89.4 degree dip. </p>

Next the bit scraped along the top at 16,336' MD, 11017.31' TVD verifying an estimated 89.3 degree dip. The samples out the top of the target window consisted of: LIMESTONE: Tan, light tan, creamy off white, silty, very sandy, crypto to microcrystalline, carbonaceous, moderate induration, fair intercrystalline porosity; even pinpoint very dull yellow ﬂuorescence, instant fair thin streaming weak cloudy cut. Continued to drill ahead in the target window then scrapped the top of the target window from 16,923’ MD 11,026.44’ TVD, to 16,972’ MD, 11027.76’ TVD showing an estimated dip of 88.5 degrees. Overall a 89 degrees was shown. The formation was projected out at an overall 89.15 degrees. </p>

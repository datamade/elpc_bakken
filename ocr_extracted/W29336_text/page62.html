LPl came in a little higher than expect and projected the landing to be at 10,112’, it was decided to waiting and see what the other markers came in at before changing the landing target. LP2 was crossed at its expected depth, projecting the target to be at 10,118’ TVD. The next two markers were slightly high, but the remaining markers in the Lodgepole stayed around 10,116’, it was decided to leave the landing target at 10,118’ TVD. The False Bakken, Scallion, and Upper Bakken Shale are three more markers used to correlate. The Upper Bakken Shale came in at a true vertical depth of 10,117’ and the ﬁnal target was set at 10,118’. The curve was landed 8’ lower than the target at 10,126’ TVD, which was slightly out of the bottom of our target window but not in any sort of trouble. The end of the curve was reached at 10,470’ MD on January 29, 2015, at 6:00 am CST. The total time for the curve was 65 hours and 45 minutes. This was slowed down considerably due to a bottom hole assembly failure at a measured depth 10,182’. The failure occurred 4:00 am CST on January 28, 2015. Drilling resumed 14 hours and 45 minutes later at 6:45 pm CST. The projected location of the bit was at 10,470’ MD and 10,126.46 TVD with an inclination of 91 ,04° and an azimuth of355. 10°. <br/>False Bakken 10,220’ MD 10,071 ’ T VD -7,807’ SS <br/>The False Bakken came in at a MD of 10,220’ with the TVD of 10,071’ and was picked by a very brief but signiﬁcant increase in gamma ray response, the increase is not as great as the Upper Bakken Shale but is easily identiﬁable when compared to the surrounded limestone. Gamma ray values peaked at 105 API, where the surrounding limestone averages slightly about 30 API. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Bakken Shale was entered at 10,249’ MD with a TVD of 10,085’. The background gas in the Bakken Shale averaged 342 and ranged from 174 to 432 units. The top of the Bakken Shale was picked by a drastic increase in the gamma ray response, through the unit gamma values averaged 223 API and peaked at 613 API. The change in lithology is also a very good indicator, changing from the typical light gray limestone of the overlying Lodgepole to a very dark gray to black shale. This contact is very sharp. The typical sample in the Upper Bakken is, SHALE: Black, blocky, ﬁssile, calcareous, carbonaceous, argillaceous, gritty, no intergranular porosity, no ﬂuorescence, instant blueish white cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,292 ’ MD 10,1 03 ’ T VD - 7,839 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 10,292’ and a TVD at 10,103’, As with the Lodgepole the contact with the overlying Upper Bakken Shale is very sharp and the samples quickly switch from a black shale to a light gray to light tan siltstone. The top of the unit is chosen due to another obvious change in the gamma ray response quickly decreasing from the 200+ API values in the Upper Bakken Shale to the mid-80’s API just below the contact and then, aﬁer 20 feet, down to just below 40 API. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling of the lateral section of the well resumed on March 6, 2015 at 2: 10 am CST. Aﬁer drilling out of the shoe the samples consisted of light gray, tan, and very light brown siltstone. The dip of the formation was projected to be about 903° overall and rising roughly 60’ over the course of the lateral. The top of the target window was set at 15 feet below the contact with the Upper Bakken Shale, a 3’ set line was placed 3’ below the top of the target window, and the bottom of the window was 7’ below the set line. <br/>Accurate well bore correlation was achieved by using the gamma ray response changes at the 3’ set line. Gamma ray values between the 3’ set line and the bottom of the window varied slightly but stayed consistently between 70 and 80 API, At the 3’ set line gamma quickly drops to 50 API before entering the highly variable gamma ray response of the Middle Bakken above the set line. <br/>The curve was landed 3’ below the bottom of the target window at the total vertical depth of 10, 126.46’, with an inclination of 91 .04°. The wellbore traveled parallel to the bottom of the window until about 10,900’ MD, where it ﬁnally entered the window. Samples below the bottom of the window were typically: SILTSTONE: Light gray, very light to medium gray tan, cream, light tan, light brown, cream tan, sub rounded to sub angular, ﬁne to very ﬁne, soft to ﬁrm, slightly calcareous, slightly dolomitic, argillaceous, poor intergranular porosity, dull yellow to orange ﬂuorescence, very weak cloudy cut. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The wellbore entered the window and stay below the 3’ set line for the next 500 feet where a MWD tool failure forced a trip at 11:45 am on March 6, 2015, at a measured depth of 11,416’. Drilling operation resumed 12 hours and 15 minutes later and the wellbore continued on a similar path. Drilling only lasted 343’ until another MWD failure forced another trip at 11,759’ MD. The rig began tripping at 3:30 am CST on March 7, 2015 and resumed drilling at 3: 10 pm on March 7, 2015, 12 hours and 20 minutes later. The two trips did not affect the path of the wellbore and it continued to climb at an inclination of roughly 91° and reached the set line at roughly 12,300’. The samples remained relatively consistent throughout the window and were very similar to the samples collected at the beginning of the lateral. They were generally described as: SILTSTONE: Light to medium gray tan, light to medium gray, very light brown, cream, light cream gray, ﬁne to very ﬁne, sub rounded to sub angular, moderately sorted, mottled, argillaceous, calcareous, slightly dolomitic, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, slow weak cloudy cut. <br/>Aﬁer crossing the 3’ set line formation dip was changed from 90.340 to 89.890 at 13,000’ MD, where the down dip trend continued until 15,000’ MD. The wellbore ran nearly parallel between the 3 ’ set line and the top of the target window, until 13,400’ MD </p>

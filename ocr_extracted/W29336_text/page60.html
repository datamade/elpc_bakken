The top was chosen by a distinct change in gamma ray response where the values quickly drop from about 62 API to below 15 API and remain consistently below 20 API for the next 25 feet. The average gamma ray response for the formation is 23 API. This is skewed slightly by the lower 190’ of the formation that averages 13.5 API, the maximum gamma value for the Mission Canyon is 63 API. Rate of penetration varies throughout the formation and was slowed down by two mud motor failures at 9,271 ’ MD and 9,422’ MD. The ﬁrst failure occurred on January 24, 2015 at 5:00 pm CST. Drilling operations resumed 12 hours and 45 minutes later at 5:45 am CST on January 25, 2015. The second motor failure occurred on January 25, 2015 at 7:05 pm CST and drilling operations resumed on January 26, 2015 at 7:45 am CST, 12 hours and 40 minutes later. On this trip the curve assembly was picked up to drill the remainder of the vertical section of the well. <br/>Due to these issues ROP averaged 30 ft/hr for the entire well, with the bottom 200 feet averaging 17 feet per hour. The lithology of the Mission Canyon remained fairly consistent throughout, typically: LIMESTONE: Light to medium gray, tan, light gray tan, light brown, cream, packstone to wackestone, ﬁne, slightly argillaceous, calcareous, slightly dolomitic, soﬁ to ﬁrm, poor intergranular porosity, dull scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming cut. <br/>Lodgepole 9, 426’ MD 9,424 ’ T VD - 7,160’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Lodgepole was identiﬁed by a slight increase in gamma ray response at 9,426’ MD and 9,424’ TVD. Gamma ray increase from roughly 15 API above the contact to slight above 20 API below the contact. Lithology throughout the Lodgepole Formation is similar to the overlying Mission Canyon. Consisting primarily of, LIMESTONE: Gray, light gray, light brown, brown, gray, mottled, packstone to wackestone, argillaceous, carbonaceous, dolomitic, poor intergranular porosity, dull scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy cut. Gamma ray values averaged 33 API, with a minimum of 11 AP] and a maximum of 69 API. <br/>Ninety eight feet into the Lodgepole Formation, at the measured depth of 9,524’, the kick off point was reached and building the curve section of the well began. <br/>Curve 9,524 ’ - 1 0,4 70’ MD <br/>The kick off point was reached at a measured depth of 9,524’ on January 26, 2015 at 12:15 pm CST. Throughout the entirety of the curve the rate of penetration averaged 25.8 feet per hour and the average build rate was 9.4° per 100 feet. <br/>Throughout the Lodgepole Formation gamma ray signatures were used to correlate 7 markers, LP1—7, with the offset well Miller 44—11H, in order to correlate the landing target in the Middle Bakken. The original target TVD for the Middle Bakken </p>

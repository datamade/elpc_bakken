    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">At the start of this section the bit was at the middle of the target zone but took a hard drop and went into the Internal 1 ﬁ'om 15,145’ to 15,350’ MD. After coming back into the target zone the leveled off brieﬂy in the middle. A slowdown in ROP was seen and at 15,697 ’ MD a trip was made for a new BHA. Aﬁer drilling resumed the bit once again traversed up and down thr0ugh the target zone until an unexpected and signiﬁcant change in dip resulted in the bit going into the Internal 1 at 17,050’ MD. Immediate adjustments were made but the amount of drop that was seen wasn’t able to be corrected until 17 ,300’ Ml). After leveling off the bit came up and back into the target zone at 17,900’ MD. Upon breaking back into the target zone the bit <br/>took a jump up in angle and the bit came to the end of this section in the middle of target zone but 15° or more above dip. <br/>At the beginning of this section showed similar gas and oil shows but at 200’ the gas buster was taken off line and showed a large increase. After approximately 200’ circulation was vented through the gas buster resulting in less shows but higher than when the gas buster was fully on. At different points of this section there were periods of erratic drill rates and differential pressure as seen before, indicating the possibility of additional fractured areas of zone. The trip at 15,697’ MD showed 5,174 units of gas and 100% coverage of green oil. Refer to chart below to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. </p>

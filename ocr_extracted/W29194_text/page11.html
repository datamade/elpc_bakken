The formation was projected out at 90.3 degrees. Next the bit re-entered the clean gamma zone at 14,181’ MD 11,145.38 TVD. Then while coming back up in the formation, the top of the clean gamma zone was encountered at 14596’ MD, 11,139.45’ TVD. This point had shown an estimated dip of 90.8 degrees. Next the wellbore went out the top of the target window at 14,700 MD, 11,136.54’ TVD; this point had shown the formation to have leveled out to a slight down dip. <br/>From 15,000’ MD to 17,000 MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.63 min/ﬂ. The background gases averaged 192 units with a max of 97 5 units. The wellbore had reentered the top of the target window at 15,045’ MD, 1 l, 137. 89’ TVD. This point had shown an 89.8 degree dip. The formation was projected out at 90 degrees. Next the clean gamma zone was encountered from 15,213’ MD, 11,142’ TVD to 15,579’ MD, 11,140.92’ TVD. These points had sown an estimated dip of 90. 18 degrees. Then the wellbore went out above the target window at 15,693’ MD, 11,137.03’ TVD. The plan going forward was to push back down into the target window. The well bore re-entered the target window at 16,167' MD, 11,136.72‘ TVD. Next the clean gamma zone was scraped from 16,230’ MD, 11,138.84’ TVD to 16,391’ MD, 11140.92’ TVD. These points had shown a 89.26 degree fold in the formation and was projected out at 90 degrees. Re-entered the clean gamma zone at 16,982’ MD, 11,140.05’ TVD; showing an estimated dip of 90.08 degrees. <br/>From 17,000‘ MD to 19,000’ MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.53 min/ft. The background gases averaged 626 units with a max of 2069 units. The wellbore went above the clean gamma zone from 17,504’ MD 11,139.31’ TVD to 17,753’ MD 11139.04’, showing an estimated 90 degree dip. The decision was made to trip out of the hole at 17,760' MD due to BHA failure at 5:10 am CST on February 11, 2015. Reached bottom and resumed drilling at 3:46 am CST on February 12, 2015. A max trip gas of 1421 units was seen with an average of 15’ to 20 foot ﬂare. Then the bit went above the clean gamma zone again at 18,337’ MD, 11137.8’ TVD showing an estimated dip of 90.12 degrees. The plan was to continue ahead at an expected dip of 90.8 degrees. Gamma markers had shown the dip went up to 90.73 degrees shown between 18,337’ MD and 18948 MD. </p>

The background gases averaged 935 units with a max of 3643 units. The formation had shown a stair step effect as the formation began to level out between 18948’ MD and 19,432’ MD. Then the clean gamma zone was seen at 19,645’ MD 11,125.62’ TVD showing a dip of 91 degrees. Next the top of the clean gamma zone was seen from 20,014’ MD 11,123.41’ TVD to 20,155’ MD 11,123.24’ TVD. Showing a ﬂat spot yet projected out at 90.5 degrees. Then at around 20,440’ MD the gamma tool failed and the decision was made to drill ahead to TD without the use of the gamma tool. The decision was made to trip out of the hole at 21,031' MD due to BHA failure at 2:07 AM., CST on February 14, 2015 Reached bottom after re-logging the last two stands and resumed drilling ahead at 5:00 AM, CST on February 15, 20151 A max trip gas of 5403 units was seen with an average of 15’ to 20 foot ﬂare.

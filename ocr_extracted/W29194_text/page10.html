The average ROP was 0.73 min/ft and background gas was around 282 units, with a max of 992 units. <br/>Three Forks 11,349' MD 11,140' TW) -8,832' SS <br/>The Three Forks was next being observed. The Three Forks was picked based on gamma and samples. The samples changed to Dolomite: Light tan, tan, light brown, microcrystalline, moderate intimation, soﬁ to ﬁrm, carbonaceous, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity, trace pyrite, 15% light green shale, even pinpoint dull yellow/green ﬂuorescence, slow thin streaming weak cloudy cut. The average ROP was 1.15 min/ﬂ and background gas was around 216 units, with a max of 590 units. The TD of the curve was reached at 11,649' lyﬂ) on February 4, 2015 around 7:30 am CST. The 7 Inch Casing was set at 11,624 MD, 11,162.81 ’ TVD. The curve was landed about 7’ feet into the target window. The samples consisted of Dolomite: Light brown, tan, light tan, microcrystalline, moderate induration, sandy, ﬁrm, carbonaceous, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity, trace micro-pyrite, even dull yellow/ green ﬂuorescence, fair thin streaming cloudy cut. The target zone ranged between 15’ and 25’ feet below the top of the Three Forks formation. <br/>Lateral #1 11,624’ MD to 21,138’ MD <br/>The rig reached bottom and began drilling ahead out of casing on February 7, 2014 around 2:40 PM., CST. The samples once they drilled out in the target window consisted of Dolomite: Light brown, tan, light tan, microcrystalline, moderate induration, sandy, ﬁrm, microsucrosic, carbonaceous, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity, trace micro-pyrite, even dull yellow, green ﬂuorescence, fair thin streaming weak cloudy cut. The samples in the Internal 1 below the target window consisted of Dolomite: Light brown, tan, brown, microcrystalline, moderate induration, soft to ﬁrm, carbonaceous, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity, trace pyrite, Shale: 45% light gray, gray, light green, even dull yellow/green ﬂuorescence, slow streaming weak cloudy cut. And the samples out the top of the target window consisted of Dolomite: Light tan, tan, brown, microcrystalline, moderate induration, ﬁrm, carbonaceous, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity, trace pyrite, Shale:30% light green, green-gray, even pinpoint dull yellow ﬂuorescence. slow thin streaming weak cloudv cut. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Upper and middle sections of the Middle Bakken showed a calcareous, subarenaceous, partially translucent, medium brown gray, tan to beige and off white siltstone which frequently alternated between slightly argillaceous ﬂakes and sub—arenaceous grains, to almost entirely silt- and very ﬁne sand-sized grains. There appeared to be signiﬁcant bioturbation or other agitation in this zone. The lower section of the Middle Bakken, beginning about 16 feet below the Upper Bakken and extending to the Lower Bakken Shale, showed a fairly argillaceous, moderately ﬂaky, medium gray, medium brown and tan fairly calcareous siltstone. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Formation dip began at about 90 degrees, and dropped into a downdip of 89.5 89.86 from 12,400 - 14,900’ MD. The downdip transitioned to an updip of 90.38 - 90.2 <br/>until 17,300’ MD. From 17,300’ MD to TD, the formation turned downwards to about 89.8 degrees. <br/>Bit number 6 remained in the hole until 12,045’ MD, where a trip was made for degraded drilling performance, and another trip was made at 12,064’ MD for MWD failure. Bit number 7, another MM64, was installed at this point. Another trip was made at 17, 259’ MD for MWD and the mud motor. Bit number 7 was rerun, and used until TD at 20,298’ MD. Return to bottom showed an apparent gamma difference of ~12 API, which was attributed to the new gamma sensor, Rate of penetration for the entire lateral averaged 0.38 feet per hour. Average background gas readings were 933 units. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The R] Moen 41-26HU was drilled in 10.86 days from spud to TD. The R] Moen was completed 100% within the Middle Bakken pay zone. Total depth was reached at 6:50 PM MT, February 28‘“, 2015 at 20,298’ MD and 11,125.52’ TVD. NCS personnel logged a total of 10,998' of wellbore. The RJ Moen is currently awaiting production operations. </p>

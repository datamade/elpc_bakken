    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">target window was set using a dip rate of 89.5 degrees. In the interval from 10,500’ to 12,060’ the wellbore drilled in the upper 2’ of the target window the majority of the time. Samples were generally described as sandstone; cream, tan, translucent, oﬂ‘ white, very ﬁne to ﬁne, subrounded, well sorted, poorly to moderately cemented, dolomitic cement; 25% shale, light blue green, off white, pyritic, ﬁssile; 5% siltstone, light gray, laminated, platy; scattered pyrite; poor to fair porosity; scattered dull green ﬂuorescence, cloudy green cut. In this interval the rate of penetration ranged from 0.12 to 3.07 minutes per foot and averaged 0.27 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 34 to 595 units and averaged 348 units. </p>

As the wellbore dropped to the lower target window, gamma gradually increases. Gamma ranged from 42 to 108 API and averaged 63 API. Total gas ranged from 11 to 640 units and averaged 364 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.20 to 3.83 minutes per foot and averaged 0.43 minutes per foot. Most samples in from this interval were described as sandstone; light tan, cream, translucent, very ﬁne grain, rare pyrite, well sorted, dolomitic cement; 10% light blue shale, platy, pyritic, ﬁssile, trace light gray siltstone; faint light brown oil straining, oily odor, good porosity, patchy dull yellow ﬂuorescence, cloudy white blue cut with faint streamers. A trip was made at 12,893’ due to extremely slow ROP. Trip gas peaked at 3777 units. <br/>Drilling continued above the target window from 12916’ to 14210’. In this interval the rate of penetration ranged from 0.20 to 3 .07 minutes per foot and averaged 0.35 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 11 to 741 units and averaged 376 units. Gamma ranged from 40 to 132 API and averaged 97 API. Most samples were described as sandstone; cream, translucent, light tan, very ﬁne to ﬁne, subrounded to subangular, moderately sorted, poorly cemented, dolomitic cement; 15% shale, light blue green, off white, pyritic, ﬁssile; 5% siltstone, light gray, laminated, platy, scattered pyrite; good porosity; scattered brown oil staining, scattered green ﬂuorescence, cloudy green weak streaming cut. Formation dip remained close to 89.5 degrees through this interval. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The wellbore again dropped down into the clean gamma, remaining there until 15,200’. In the interval from 14,210’ to 15,200’ the rate of penetration ranged from 0.27 to 2.67 minutes per foot and averaged 0.61 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 28 to 988 units and averaged 344 units. Gamma ranged from 42 to 94 API and averaged 64 API. . A trip was made at 14,981’ due to a tool failure. When back on bottom the new tool failed to work. Aﬁer getting back to bottom the second time trip gas peaked at 988 units with a 20’ ﬂare for about 15 minutes. Samples from this interval were the same as those collected from the previous interval drilled in the clean, from 12,060’ to 12,916’. <br/>Drilling continued, with the wellbore beginning to build. Drilled above the top of the target window until sliding brought the wellbore down to reencounter the set line. Aﬁer the clean was seen it was determined the formation was ﬂattening, so a target adjustment was made to 90 degrees. The wellbore dropped hard aﬁer breaking through the hard streak at the set line.

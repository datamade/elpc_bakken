    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">target inclination needed to be adjusted. Even though correlations were low in conﬁdence, target <br/>inclination was set to 90.4 degrees as indicated on the latest stmcture map. Over the last 1,800’ of lateral, penetration rates continued to averaged 250 - 300 ft/hr, total gas <br/>averaged 850 — 1,200 units. Wellbore remained slightly ﬂatter than target, causing it to eventually mover to the bottom half of the target window. Correlations continued to be difﬁcult since gamma signature continued to be somewhat anomalous for what was previously seen in the lateral. Formation dip appeared to be averaging 90.3 — 90.5 degrees as previous wells on the pad had ﬁnished and it was consistent with <br/>current structure map. It was determined wellbore was likely in the lower portion of the geologic zone of interest and depending on interpretation could be 1-3‘ out the bottom of the zone. Final depth of the Middle Bakken lateral was reached at 20,952’ MD on January 29‘“, 2015 at 8:45 am CST. A projection to bit showed wellbore ﬁnished approximately at the bottom of the geologic zone of interest. <br/>Conclusion </p>

As the structure map indicated and past wells in the area had shown, formation dip was expected to change several times throughout the entire lateral. Dip was expected to be mostly ﬂat through the beginning portion of the lateral and then transition to a toe-up through the middle portion, while the last few thousand feet was expected to once again be ﬂat. Average dip rate was expected to be around 90.27 degrees over the entire lateral. <br/>Gamma signature and correlations were weak to begin the lateral as wellbore started extremely ﬂat, covering very little formation. Formation dip was estimated at 89.95 — 90.05 degrees. Correlations remained difficult for much of the well due to lack of contact with clean gamma marker at the top of the geologic zone. Even when contact with the clean maker was made, correlations remained incredibly difﬁcult due to a somewhat anomalous gamma signature afterwards. Formation dip for the ﬁnal 1,500’ was estimated at 90.4 degrees, similar to the way other wells on the pad had ﬁnished. Even though formation dip changed several times throughout the lateral, overall wellbore position was estimated to be near the center of the geologic zone of interest for the majority of the lateral. <br/>Lithology made several color transitions as wellbore moved down, through the zone and then back up into geologic zone. Samples typically showed light gray to light gray brown dolomitic siltstone with dull blue yellow ﬂuorescence and a slow weak cut. Through most of the lateral, total gas typically averaged around 500 — 1,200 units with slight increases at connections. Well was drilled at an average target inclination of 90.2 degrees with average formation dip estimated at 90.25 degrees for the entire lateral. Average formation dip was 0.02 degrees below the original anticipated well dip of 90.27 degrees. Upon reaching total depth of the lateral it was estimated well was drilled 94% in zone. <br/>Jared Bryl Tom Osadchuk Wellsite Geologists </p>

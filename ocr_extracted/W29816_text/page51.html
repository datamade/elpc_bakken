A trip out of the hole to pick up curve assembly prior to reaching a KOP of 10,734‘ MD, was made due to slow penetration rates. <br/>Beginning the build portion, drill rates averaged 40 — 60 ft/hr while sliding 90 — 100 %. Samples continued to show gray argillaceous dolomitic limestone. Gamma markers in the upper portion of the formation were surprisingly good, each generating consistent landing targets. The upper to middle Lodgepole markers suggested the Middle Bakken was coming in slightly higher than anticipated, but no changes to target were made. <br/>Markers through the middle and lower portions of the Lodgepole showed the distance between markers was slightly thicker than the ﬁrst half of the formation. This suggested the Middle Bakken would come in on target. No changes to target were made at the time since current target was within a few feet of the ideal landing target. <br/>Upper Bakken I 1,432 ’ MD 11,255 ' T VD -8,818 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Upper Bakken was reached at approximately 11,432’ MD / 11,255‘ TVD, with the original prediction on the prognosis. The formation top was first estimated in real time with drill rates then reﬁned by the gamma. Samples transitioned to black carbonaceous shale with total gas increasing to average 300 — 500 units and over 600 units at connection. After reaching the base of the shale the total thickness was estimated to be 19’, 1’ thinner than predicted on the prognosis. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,485 ’ MD 11,2 74 ' TVD -8,83 8 ’ SS <br/>At 11,485' MD weight on bit increased as rates of penetration decreased, gamma began dropping below 150 API to conﬁrm the top of the Middle Bakken, 1’ higher than the original estimated top. This suggested a ﬁnal landing target of 11,294' TVD at 20 feet below the upper shale, 2.7’ higher than final landing target. Samples transitioned to gray argillaceous siltstone with drill rates averaging 20 - 80 ft/hr, total gas averaging 175 — 400 units. Continuing to drill ahead, wellbore dropped in structure slightly as gamma ﬂuctuated around 80 — 90 API. Total depth of the curve was reached at 11,630” MD on January 2, 2015 at 9:51 pm CST. <br/>North Middle Bakken lateral 11,630 ’ — 20,952 ’ MD <br/>After setting intermediate casing, picking up directional tools, drill pipe, and drilling cement, drilling new formation was resumed at approximately 6:05 am CST on January 25", 2015. While breaking in the motor, penetration rates were held to under 200 ft/hr while rotating. Frequent slides were done to build azimuthal turn needed to begin heading to the north. While beginning the lateral in the lower half of the geologic zone of interest, targets were set to reflect a 900 degree dip rate. <br/>Drilling ahead formation appeared to be ﬂat as wellbore remained in the lower half of the target window for the first 700’ MD of the lateral. Correlations were weak due to the fact wellbore had not moved more than 1’ TVD. Even though correlations were weak formation clip was estimated to be 89.9 — 90.1 degrees. This was consisted with current structure map and seismic data from the area. A typical sample consisted of gray to light gray dolomitic siltstone, cut and ﬂuorescence shows were fair. Total gas averaged 300 — 600 units with slight increases at connections. Penetration rates averaged 200 — 250 ft/hr with gamma averaging 80 — 100 API units. Drilling ahead past 12,500’ MD wellbore inclination began to build and for the first time moved up to near the center of the target window. This made for a slight improvement in correlations, but confidence was still low. Formation dip was still estimated to be flat, as wellbore appeared to be at dip of formation. Inclination consistently held with little to no input from sliding, conﬁrming initial estimates. <br/>Over the next 1,000’ MD wellbore remained ﬂat with very little input from direction slides. This continued to suggest formation clip was averaging 90.0 degrees. Correlation slightly improved, but were still weak overall, due to the lack of cross section coverage by the wellbore. Samples made little to no </p>

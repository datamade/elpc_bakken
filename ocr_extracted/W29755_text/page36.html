Layers of anhydrite, salt, shale and limestone made up the remainder of the Charles Formation Drilling rates varied from the very fast 0.25 min/ﬂ: rate in the salt to 1.0 min/ft in the harder limestone. Total gas was negligible (<100 units). </p>

Rate of penetration rates were consistently in the .25 to .50 min/ﬂ range. Samples presented a salt facies approximately 10' thick. A deﬁnite transition to limestone occurred at the BLS as ROP decreased to 0.5 min/ﬂ. Total gas remained negligible (<100 units). <br/>Mssion Canyon 9,358’MD 9,34 7’ TVD -7,000’ SS <br/>The pick of the Mission Canyon was estimated at MD 9,368' and TVD 9,357', 10’ high to the prognosis. ROP became erratic in the top 200' of the Mission Canyon formation but settled down to a more consistent 0.5 min/ﬂ as the well bore deepened. Total gas remained in the 100-200 unit range. </p>

Formation samples in the Lodgepole exhibited a very consistent, very hard, light to medium gray limestone with a transition to a medium to dark gray in the lower part of the formation. KOP was established at MD 10,3 84'. <br/>Total gas readings remained in the 50-100 unit until reaching the KOP in the Lodgepole formation where gas readings increased signiﬁcantly with readings in the 67000 unit range.

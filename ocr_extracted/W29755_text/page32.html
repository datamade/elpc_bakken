    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Spotted Hawk Development LLC Avalanche 36-14 MB2 was one of three (3) additional wells drilled on a single pad (Avalanche Pad) located in S36 151N 95W. The Avalanche 36-14 MB2 was drilled as a single horizontal lateral with the primary objective being in the lower Middle Bakken formation. Target depth for the lateral was 25’ into the Middle Bakken siltstone. This well is located on Lot 3 Section 36, T151N, and R95W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Avalanche 36—14 MB2 spudded on November 4, 2014 and reached a total depth of 15,426’ MD on February 8, 2015. This well was drilled using an invert based mud system for the vertical and curve before switching to saltwater for the lateral. Dan Grifﬁn and Lynda Grifﬁn of Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided well site mud logging services beginning at a depth of 7,000' in the Opeche Formation through total depth (15,426’) in the Middle Bakken target zone. Thirty foot (30’) lagged samples were caught, examined and logged throughout the vertical and Curve with 100’ samples taken in the lateral. Samples will be sent to Spotted Hawk Development LLC and NDIC, <br/>The prognosis for the Avalanche 36—14 MB2 proved to be slightly low to the actual tops encountered through the vertical well bore. The Charles Salt came in 21' high to the prognosis and the Base of the Last Salt came in 5' high- The Lodgepole came in 16’ high, and the top of the Upper Bakken Shale came in 3’ high to the prognosis. The TVD target for the Middle Bakken landing was set at and remained at TVD 10,875’. The curve was landed at MD 11,238’, TVD 10,867’ at 90.3 degrees. Casing was set at MD 11,160’. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">An NCS Total Gas unit was utilized for monitoring total gas. Scientiﬁc Drilling was used for MWD for the vertical and curve. Multi Shot was use for MWD for the lateral. The Company Man handled directional drilling responsibilities. <br/>Gamma was not employed in the vertical but was incorporated in the BHA starting at the KOP through well TD. <br/>NOTE: Total gas readings were exceptionally high in the Lodgepole formation, starting at MD 10,520’, where gas readings reached 6190 units. The gas buster was utilized at Ml) 10,600’ producing a 1-3’ ﬂare. These high gas readings persisted through the remainder of the Lodgepole and into the top of the Upper Bakken Shale. 0f the other six (6) wells on this pad, none exhibited gas readings similar to this well. <br/>Tyler 7, 773’ MD 7, 765’ T VD -5,41 7’ SS <br/>The top of the Tyler Formation came in at MD 7,773' and TVD 7,765' and was marked by a change in ROP. Formation samples transitioned from a light reddish brown dolostone to a vari-colored shale. </p>

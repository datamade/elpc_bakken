    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">These wells will be connected to Hiland’s low pressure gathering system in Dunn County, North Dakota. Oxy’s acreage that comprises the spacing unit (SU) for the Sharon Rainey 2-17-20H142-96, Sharon Rainey 3-17—20H—142-96, Sharon Rainey 4-17-20H-142-96 and Sharon Rainey 5-17-20H-142-96 is dedicated to Hiland. Under terms of the contract, Hiland is obligated to install the facilities that are required to connect these wells to its gathering system. Oxy provides (on a monthly basis) to Hiland a drilling, completion and estimated ﬁrst production date for all wells that are scheduled to be drilled in the foreseeable future. In addition, Oxy and Hiland have conference calls to discuss connection status of wells and changes to Oxy’s drilling and completion schedules when needed. <br/>Gathering System <br/>Gas from this pad will be gathered on Hiland’s low pressure WC-Manning Gathering System and processed at Hiland’s Watford City Processing Plant located in Section 6, TlSlN, RIOZW, McKenzie County, North Dakota. <br/>In addition to Hiland, ONEOK owns and operates a low pressure gathering line approximately one-quarter mile south of the Hiland tie-in point for this pad. Petro-Hunt has a low pressure gathering system approximately nine miles northwest of the Sharon Rainey pad location. ONEOK’s and Petro-Hunt’s lines, along with Hiland’s, are shown on the attached maps. <br/>The production facilities for the Sharon Rainey 2-17-20H-142-96, Sharon Rainey 3-17-20H-l4296, Sharon Rainey 4—17-20H—l42-96 and Sharon Rainey 5-17-20H—l42-96 wells will be located adjacent to Oxy’s Sharon Rainey l-l7-20H—142-96 production facilities which are connected to Hiland’s low pressure gathering system. It will require less than 250’ of pipe to connect the new wells to Hilands’s low pressure gathering system. <br/>Existing Lines </p>

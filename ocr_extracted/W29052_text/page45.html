(CR1) respectfully submits the following information concerning the dollng ofthe Robert l—i3H Pad, NENW Sec. 13, T1 SSN, RIOOW, Williams County, North Dakota. <br/>The Robert 1-13H Well is located in a Well Head Protection Area. CRI would like to propose the following safeguards and precautions to be taken to prevent any contamination to freshwater sources during the drilling and completiOn of the Well. <br/>1) <br/>3) <br/>5) <br/>5) <br/>7) <br/>8) <br/>During construcﬁonnf the location, the entire location will he lined with a 30 mil plastic liner to ensure any Spills or runoff which occur on location do not penetrate the fresh ground water and are contained on surface of the location. <br/>Drainage will be re-routed to avoid the location and fiber rolls will be deployed outside an earthen berm to reduce sediment contaminati On to freshwater runoﬁ due to weather events. <br/>The earthen berm constructed to keep any freshwater mnoff offthe' location will also eliminate any spills from leaving the location <br/>No reserve pit or dry cuttings pit will be utilized on location <br/>The conductor will be drilled to a depth of '100’ and 20” pipe will be run to depth and cemented to ‘s’urfaCe. "Ith ﬁrst mouse hole will be drilled to a depth of 75’, lined with 14” steel pipe and cemented to surface. The second mouse hole will be drilled to a depth of 15’ and lined with 14” steel pipe and cemented to surface. <br/>During drilling operations, a freshwater protection string of 13-3/8” 48# H40 casing will be set to a depth of 300’ and cemented to surface to protect the shallow freshwater zones. Standard 95/8” 36# I-55' surface casing will be Set' 100’ into the Pierre Shale to. a depth of 2190’ and cemented to surface. <br/>A free string; will be used to protect the intermediate casing during hydraulic fracturing of the well. <br/>CM is submitting a comprehensive; site speciﬁc Spill Contingency Plan to prepare for any event which may ocCur during drilling and completion operations. <br/>CR1 believes a Flood Prevention plan is not necessary for this site due to‘ the: Army Corps of Engineers documentation that the high water“ level for Lake Sakaltawea will not affect any elevation 1855’ above sea level or higher. The finished rig grade elevation for. Robert 1—13H. is 2164’ above sea level. - <br/>CR1 believes adequate planning and preeallﬁo'ns are being taken to prevent any contamination to ground water: shallow aquifers, and freshwater reservoirs; <br/>{/jﬂgo/U “#4 Adam Reitz, Project Deﬂ—o—pment Engineer <br/>Continental Resources, Inc. </p>

Drilling rates in the Lodgepole above KOP of 10,3 75’ MD ranged from 0.08—5.92 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 1.01 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 39—522 units averaging 84 units. Typical samples were: LIMESTONE: Gray, dark gray, light gray to light gray tan, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, dolomitic in part, fair to good induration, poor to no intergranular porosity, even dull blue green florescence, weak milky cut. Curve tools were picked up once kick off point of 10,3 75’ MD was reached at 8:30 PM MST on December 29, 2014. <br/>Curve 10,375’—11,150’MD <br/>Drilling ofthe curve began at 11:30 AM MST on December 30, 2014. An initial landing target of 10,751’ TVD was set before curve was started. Drilling rates in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged from 03—583 minutes per foot with an average of 0.76 minutes per foot. Gas in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged from 28-178 units with average of 64 units. Gamma ranged from 17-77 API with an average of 33 API. Typical samples were: LIMESTONE: Dark gray, gray, medium gray, brown gray, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, dolomitic in part, fair to good induration, poor to no intergranular porosity, even dull green ﬂorescence, fair milky cut. Gamma markers throughout the Lodgepole and formation tops of the False Bakken, Upper Bakken Shale, and Middle Bakken were used to correlate with the State 154-102-25—36-1H and State 154-102-25-36-3H showing a landing target around 10,750’ TVD, 19 feet higher than the original well prognosis landing target of 10,769’ TVD. The curve reached TD of MD 11150 / INC 9000 / AZ 192.50/TVD 10751.05 /VS 659.18. </p>

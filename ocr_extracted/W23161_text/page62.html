Oil and water will be continuously measured in a combined liquid phase via a Coriolis meter and NOC (net oil computer). Gas will be measured continuously via an orifice-plate or cone meter. After the individual well liquid volumes have been separately measured, liquid from each 2—phase separator will dump into a bulk three phase separator. Oil will dump from the 3—phase separator into tanks or to a pipeline LACT (lease automated custody transfer). Water will dump from the 3—phase separator to tanks or a pipeline LACT <br/>The oil sales volume per well will be calculated as follows: <br/>1. <br/>The meter factor will represent the most recent valid meter factor based on quarterly master meter proving. The meter factor will include a correction to standard conditions based on proving data, measured fluid temperatures and pressures. <br/>Measured daily well volume will be the measured oil volume as recorded by the coriolis meter. <br/>The measured daily well volume will be corrected to standard conditions via the net oil computer. Measurement will be done continuously. Triangle personnel will verify the NOC (net <br/>oil computer) measurement daily. Measured meter data will be stored and archived. <br/>Measured monthly well volumes will represent the sum ofthe prior months measured daily volumes times the meter factor. <br/>The measured monthly pad volume will represent the sum of the measured monthly well volumes from each well. The custody transfer pad volume will represent the actual volume sold through a LACT or tank <br/>gauges and trucks. The monthly well sales volume will be calculated by multiplying the custody transfer pad volume <br/>times the measured monthly well volume divided by the monthly measured pad volume. Well revenue will be calculated based on the monthly well sales volume. </p>

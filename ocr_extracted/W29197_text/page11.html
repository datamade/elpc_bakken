    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Whiting Oil and Gas Iverson 31-14TFH is a Sanish well located in the NW NE of Section 14 T154N R92W in Mountrail County, North Dakota. The initial phase of the Iverson 31-14TFH is a vertical section, with a subsequent curve landing within the ﬁrst bench of the Three Forks Fm. The Iverson 31-14TFH well spud on January 16, 2015 and reached a total depth of 18,420’MD on January 27, 2015. Well site geological services began at 8,400 feet in the Charles Formation. Thirty and ﬁfty foot lagged samples were collected. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. </p>

Gas detection system was recalibrated and tested before logging depth with system functioning correctly. Drill rates ranged from 1.0-3.5 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 11-17 units. <br/>Base of the Last Salt 8,5 70’ MD 8,564 ’ TVD -6,153 ’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered at 8,570’ MD; -6,153’ SS. Base of the last salt was picked by the last sample with salt present. Samples then became beds of anhydrite, shale and occasional limestone, until the Mission Canyon. <br/>Mission Canyon 8, 720’ MD 8, 714’ T VD -6,303 ’ SS <br/>Mission Canyon was picked from lithology change and the offset log, ROP was 1.5-3 minutes a foot. Samples consisted of: Limestone: Gray, light gray, trace mottled, mudstone, dolomitic, trace argillaceous, moderate induration, trace anhydrite, white, Cryptocrystalline, tight, trace dead oil staining, mineral ﬂuorescence only, slow pale yellow orange cut. Gas ranged from 11—23 units. </p>

Drill rates in the Lodgepole ranged from 1.5-2.5 minutes per foot rotating with gas ranging from 11-22 units Typical samples were: Limestone: Light to medium gray brown, medium to dark gray, light grey in part, trace cream, off-white, microcrystalline, fair amounts of blocky chops, platy in part, <br/>moderately hard to soft, no visible porosity, no ﬂuorescence, no cut. KOP was at 9,810’ MD. </p>

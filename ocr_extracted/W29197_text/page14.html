We started the lateral at 3 :40 am January 24, 2015. The initial dip rate of the lateral would be at 90.6 degrees. <br/>Drilling of the Iverson horizontal started at 3:40 am on January 24, 2015. The target zone for this well is 10’ thick with the curve landing 10 lower than the target window. Upon drilling out of casing the plan was to drill steeper then the formation dip of 90.6 to come up in the target zone in hopes of ﬁnding repeat gamma for correlation purposes. The ﬁrst part of the lateral we made a 20 degree turn. While making the turn we took 30 ft surveys. On January 25, 2015 the formation dip was calculated to a formation dip of 90.50 based upon on correlating gamma. On January 26, 2015 we made a ﬁnal formation dip change to a dip of 90.87 based upon on correlating gamma. We Reached TD at 1:10am on January 27, 2015 Total gas was typically between 120 to 450 units with spikes up to 500 units. A typical sample exhibited SILTSTONE: Medium brownish gray, light brown, argillaceous, dolomitic, pyritic, highly calcareous, light to medium brown oil staining, thin dark gray laminations, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered dull green ﬂuorescence, slow pale streaming yellow cut. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The Iverson 31-14TFH would reach a total depth of 18,420’ and a true vertical depth of 10,310.51,’ at 1:10 am CDT on January 27, 2015. The Iverson 31-14TFH is currently awaiting completion. <br/>Matt Buckalew/ Josh Oothoudt WelIsite Mudlogger </p>

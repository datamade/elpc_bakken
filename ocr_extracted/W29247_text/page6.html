The well bore would be drilled northward, traversing one geographical section in T154N - R102W: Section 12. The Middle Bakken Member was 31 ’ thick at location. <br/>Lithologically, the Middle Bakken was expected to consist of dolomitic siltstone. <br/>Structurally, the formation was expected to ascend, n'sing 5’ over the course of the well bore, with an average inclination of 90.06 degrees. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Operation <br/>On 11/10/14 we began building the curve from a KOP of 10147’. The curve was completed on 11/11/14, at a measured depth of 11005’. The casing was set at 10986’ MD, approximately 12’ down from the Middle Bakken Top. <br/>We commenced the lateral on 11/ 13/ 14. Drilling to 11015 ’, we conducted the F. I. T. for approximately one hour, then continued drilling ahead. <br/>Lithologically, the Middle Bakken consisted of siltstone. The rock was buff, tan, light to medium brown, and light to medium gray in color. The siltstone was dolomitic, and showed tight to poor intergranular porosity. <br/>Gas shows were good. Total gas values averaged 700 units with a 2’ ﬂare. <br/>Cuts were ﬂash blue-white cuts. N0 oil shows were present. <br/>Structurally, the Middle Bakken ran level, then dipped down. The formation dropped 10.75’ over the course of the well bore, a differential of 15.5 ’ from the expected 5’ rise. The average inclination of the formation was 89.85 degrees. <br/>The bit entered the Upper Bakken Shale at 15078’. As a result, the last 40’ of well bore is present in the Upper Bakken Shale. <br/>We TD’d the well on 11/16/14, with a total depth drilled of 151 18’. 4132’ ofhole was drilled beyond the casing. </p>

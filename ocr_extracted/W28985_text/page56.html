    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">the target window at 14087’ MD, 11,040.84‘ TVD, and reentered the targeted zone at a MD of 14510 with a TVD of 1 1,041 .39' verifying an 89.93 degree clip. The samples out the top ofthe target window consisted of: LIMESTONE: Tan, light tan, creamy off white, silty, very sandy, crypto to microcrystalline, carbonaceous, moderate induration, fair intercrystalline porosity; even pinpoint very dull yellow ﬂuorescence, instant fair thin streaming weak cloudy cut. <br/>From 15,000' MD to 17,000 MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.44 min/ﬂ. The background gases averaged 322 units with a max of 1132 units. The wellbore continued to dl‘lll ahead in the middle of the target window. Samples at this time consisted of: LIMESTONE: Light brown, tan, brown, light gray, gray, ﬁrm, silty, microcrystalline, microsucrosic, carbonaceous, slightly dolomitic, moderate induration, poor to fair intergranular porosity; trace pinpoint very dull yellow/green ﬂuorescence, slow thin streaming weak cloudy cut. Overall a 89.95 degrees was shown. <br/>From 17,000' MD to 19,000’ MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.49 min/ft. The background gases averaged 278 units with a max of 715 units. At around 17,000 MD, the formation started to turn back up to around 90.1 to a 90.57 degrees. The bit At this time the samples showed LIMESTONE: Light brown, tan, light tan, brown, light gray, ﬁrm, silty, microcrystalline, microsucrosic, carbonaceous, dolomitic, moderate induration, poor to fair intergranular porosity; even yellow/green ﬂuorescence, faint streaming cut. While drilling in the <br/>targeted zone of the Middle Bakken. From 19,000’ MD to 20,744’ MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.49 min/ft. The <br/>background gases averaged 193 units with a max of 1875 units. At this time the samples were showing: LIMESTONE: Light brown, tan, light tan, brown, light gray, ﬁrm, silty, platy in part. microcrystalline, microsucrosic, carbonaceous, slightly dolomitic, moderate induration, poor to fair intergranular porosity; even bright yellow/ green ﬂuorescence, fair streaming weak cloudy cut. The TD of the well was reached at 20,945' MD around 8:45 AM CST on November 26, <br/>2014. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Overall the well had fair gas and poor to fair oil shows. In the Middle Bakken the rate of penetration averaged 0.42 min/ft. Lateral #1 ﬁnished with 89% of the wellbore being in the Middle Bakken target. The wellbore was estimated to be around 9% being in the out the top of the Middle Bakken target window. We are very excited to see the results once the well is put into production. <br/>Dennis Corwin Wellsite Geologist </p>

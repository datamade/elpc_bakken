The wellbore would begin rising following the drilling of the shoe. 2 downslides were put in at 11,290’ MD and 11,445’ MD to prevent the continued rise in the wellbore. These slides would send the wellbore dropping in the formation. A high side slide was put in to level the wellbore off in the formation. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">This slide along with a deﬂection down would send the wellbore back down into the target window at 14,150’ Nﬂ). 2 high side slides were put in at 14,228’ Nﬂ). Drilling would continue in the middle portion of the target window until a rise in the wellbore was seen at 14,570’ MD. A downslide put in at 14,671’ MD would counter this rise and keep the wellbore in the lower portion of the target window. <br/>A downslide put in at 15,082’ MD would send the wellbore dropping in the formation through the base of the target window at 15,380’ Nﬂ). 2 high side slides were put in at 15,300’ MD and 15,504’ MD to send the wellbore back up into the target window at 15,710’ MD. <br/>Drilling would continue in the lower portion of the target window until 2 high side slides were put in at 16,224’ MD to prevent the drop in rotation. These slides would send the wellbore into through the top of the target window at 17,045’ Nﬂ). Prior to this the A/C marker was encountered at 17,095’ Nﬂ). This encounter would indicate a slight down dip of 89.95 degrees. A downslide put in at 17,145’ MD would send the wellbore dropping back into the target window at 17,435’ MD. <br/>This drop would continue until a high side slide was put in at 17,926’ MD. This slide would send the wellbore rising in the formation, up and out of the target window at 18,175’ MD. 3 downslides were put in at 18,274’ MD to level the wellbore of and send it back down into the target window. <br/>The wellbore would re-enter the target window at 18,595’ MD. A high side slide was put in at 18,560’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. Drilling would continue in the middle portion of the target window until 3 high side slides starting at 19,600’ MD would send the wellbore rising in the formation. An encounter with the A/C contact at 20,090’ MD would indicate a ﬁirther steepening in the formation to 89.48 degrees. A downslide was put in at 20,010’ MD to prevent the continued rise in the wellbore. The wellbore would exit through the top of the target window at 20,420’ MD. </p>

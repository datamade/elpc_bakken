Thorson 159-94-7A-18-1HS was drilled as a single leg horizontal well targeting the Middle Bakken. The well is located in Section 7 T159N R94W in Burke County, North Dakota, USA. The K. Thorson 159-94-7A-17-1HS was spud September 23, 2014. A total measured depth of 19,045 feet was reached on November 4, 2014 at 4:00 am central standard time; 20 days from spud. A 12.25 inch wellbore was drilled from surface to a measured depth of 1,951 feet. At that time 9.625 inch casing was set. Geological services began at 7,400 feet within the Charles, with 24 hour supervision through the vertical hole, curve and lateral. Thirty and ﬁfty foot samples were caught and saved to be archived with the ND Core and Sample Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. All ﬁles were submitted per NDIC requirements. A Neset total gas detector was utilized for monitoring total gas to the total depth of the well. Whose <br/>Vertical Hole 7,400’ MD — 8, 700’ MD <br/>Logging began within the Charles at a measured depth of 7,400 feet on September 28, 2014 at approximately 2:00 pm central standard time. </p>

Samples at that time were described as a tan gray to gray, ﬁrm, calcareous shale with approximately 25 percent anhydrite. <br/>Mission Canyon 7,895 ’ MD 7,893.6’ TVD -5, 548. 6’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon was encountered at a measured depth of 7,895 feet, a true vertical depth of 7,893.6 feet and sub-sea of -5,548.6 feet, 13.6 feet low to prognosis. Samples at that time were described as a tan gray, ﬁrm to hard, microcrystalline, argillaceous limestone. A high gas reading of 195 units was recorded while drilling within the Mission Canyon <br/>Lodgepole 8,514’ MD 8,512.54’ TVD -6,167. 54’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 8,5 14 feet, a true vertical depth of 8,5 12.54 feet and sub—sea of -6, 167.54 feet, 7.46 feet high to prognosis. Samples at that time were described as a tan gray to gray tan, ﬁrm to hard, microcrystalline, limestone. <br/>Kick off point was reached at a measured depth of 8,700 feet at 12:30 am central standard time on September 28, 2014. At that time the pipe was tripped out of the hole to pick up the bottom hole assembly for the curve. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The curve was completed at a measured depth of 9,601 feet on October 2, 2014 at 12:00 pm central stande time. Directional projected a true vertical depth of 9,252. 17 feet and an inclination of 90 degrees at the bit. Based on this projection it was estimated the bit landed approximately 18 feet into the Three Forks. <br/>A wiper trip was done. A maximum trip gas of 174 units was recorded. Once back on bottom another 14 feet was drilled to a measured depth of 9,615 feet for easing <br/>purposes. Lateral No.1 9,615’ MD — 19,045’ MD <br/>Drilling resumed on October 27, 2014 at approximately 6:00 pm central standard time. Targets were set at a target true vertical depth of 9,252 feet at a measured depth of 9,600 feet projected out at the estimated dip of 89.2 degrees. <br/>While drilling ahead within the target window samples were described as a tan cream, ﬁrm, microsucrosic dolomite. Varying percentages of light green pyritic shale and siltstone were also noted in most samples. Spotty brown oil staining was noted in association with the dolomite. Background gas ranged between 300 to 700 units. Oil could also be seen at the shakers. <br/>Gamma correlations indicated dips had shallowed closer to 89.7 degrees. Because of this targets were adjusted at a measured depth of 10,800 feet and true vertical depth of 9,268.8 feet to a target inclination of 89.5 degrees. Dips of 89.4 to 8952 degrees were calculated as the wellbore moved within the target window. Because of this no target changes were made. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">At a measured depth of 13,890 feet gamma increased over 100 api indicating the deﬁnitive gamma marker at the base of the target zone. The target true vertical depth was shiﬁed up 2.5 feet at a measured depth of 13,900 feet to a true vertical depth of 9,294.2 feet. The target inclination remained at 89.5 degrees. Samples while drilling within this very hot gamma zone were described as a platy, pyritic, light green shale. This rock exhibited poor intergranular porosity as well as pinpoint streaming, weak cloudy cuts. As the wellbore moved back up above the hottest gamma zone a dip of 89.7 degrees was found. No target change were made at that time. <br/>At a measured depth of 15,011 feet measured depth a wiper trip was done back to a bit depth of 13,450 feet. Once back on bottom a max trip gas of 1470 units was recorded. A 5 foot ﬂare was also seen at that time. </p>

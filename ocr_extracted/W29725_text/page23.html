It was picked by a slight up spike in gamma at 10,326 feet MD. The lithology of the Lodgepole formation was mainly limestone that was gray, tan gray, and light gray with an even green ﬂuorescence and weak cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 100 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 139 units with a max of 522 units through the Lodgepole formation. </p>

The Lodgepole markers were correlated to the Eide 41-13-2H and Bide 41-13-3H gamma data. Baker Hughes directional team started the curve with an average built rate of 10.5 degrees per 100 feet needed. While correlating gamma signatures between Eide 41-132H and Bide 41-13-3H, the landing target stayed consistent between 11,150 feet and 11,149 feet TVD throughout the seven Lodgepole formation markers. The formation markers of the Eide 41 -13-4H were consistent with the Eide 41-13-2H and 41-13-3H wells, allowing the original target depth of 11,148 feet TVD to remain an accurate target throughout the build section of the well. <br/>False Bakken 11,308’ MD 11,107’ TVD -8,812’ SS <br/>The False Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,308 feet, consistent to the prognosis. The pick of the False Bakken was primarily done off gamma correlation to the Eide 41—13-3H curve gamma. The lithology of the False Bakken formation was tan gray to light tan gray with an even green ﬂuorescence and a fast streaming cloudy cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 74 ft/hr. Gas was an average of 346 units with a maximum of 556 units through the False Bakken formation. </p>

The pick of the Upper Bakken was primarily done off gamma correlation to Eide 41-13-3H curve gamma. The lithology of the Upper Bakken formation was shale that was black and dark brown with a dull even green ﬂuorescence and a thick yellow cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 107 fi/hr. Gas was an average of 560 units with a maximum of 2267 units through the Upper Bakken formation. <br/>Mddle Bakken 11,409’ MD 11,134 ’ TVD -8,839’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,409 feet, 2 feet low to the prognosis.

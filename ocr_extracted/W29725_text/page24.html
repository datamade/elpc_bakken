The lithology of the Middle Bakken formation was sandstone and siltstone that was gray, tan gray, and dark gray that was ﬁne to very ﬁne grained. Rate of penetration was an average of 81 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 601 units with a max of 1364 units through the Middle Bakken formation. <br/>Casing point was reached @ 11,547' MD on November 29, 2014 at 2:20 PM CST in the Middle Bakken. Drilling ceased with a true vertical depth of 11,144.6 feet and measured depth of 11,547 feet, landing 10 feet into the Middle Bakken formation. </p>

According to the structure map, it was believed this well would average a 90.2 degree up dip - expecting formation to come up a total of 25—30 feet throughout the lateral section. Formation trended slightly upwards throughout the horizontal section of the well. From the beginning of the lateral to 12,500 feet, the dip was between 90.05 and 90.06 degrees. The next 1,000 feet, the formation dip increased slightly to 90.23 degrees, before brieﬂy decreasing to 90.11 degrees over the next 500 feet. From 14,500 feet to 16,000 feet the dip increased again to 90.23 degrees. Starting around 16,500 feet to 17,500 feet the dip decreased to 90.11 degrees. Formation ﬂattened to 90 degrees starting at 17,500 feet and remained ﬂat until 19,500 feet. The next 1,000 feet of the lateral section was slightly up at 90.17 degrees. From 20,500 feet to total depth was reached the dip ﬂattened to 90 degrees. <br/>The Eide 41-13-4H lateral was completed in four runs using two Reed SK516M style drill bits. The decision was made at 17473' MD to TOOH for motor failure at 9: 15 PM CST on December 3, 2014. Drilling was resumed at 4:00 PM CST on December 4, 2014. The decision was made at 20829' MD to TOOH for MWD tool failure at 4:15 AM CST on December 6, 2014. Drilling was resumed at 9:15 PM CST on December 6, 2014. The decision was made at 21292' MD to TOOH for motor failure at 3:00 AM CST on December 7, 2014. Drilling was resumed at 6:05 PM CST on December 7, 2014. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The lithology of the Middle Bakken formation was siltstone that was relatively medium to dark in color. The majority of the Eide 41-13-4H lateral section was drilled in the target window and in the C facies. Throughout the C facies gray, dark gray, and tan gray siltstone were the dominate colors found. As the wellbore trended up into the B facies, the dominate colors were slightly lighter in color and ranged ﬁom light gray to tan gray and cream gray. The brief footage drilled out of the top of the target window and within a few feet of the Upper Bakken Shale was more of a mixture between sandstone and siltstone. Along with gamma interpretations, these subtle differences in color, as we transitioned through the zone, made it possible to distinguish structural position. <br/>Gas readings averaged 522 units in the lateral section of the well, giving a consistent ﬂare from 14,600 feet measured depth on. As the amount of open hole was increased through the lateral section, the gas ﬂare grew. From 14,600 feet to 16,800 feet </p>

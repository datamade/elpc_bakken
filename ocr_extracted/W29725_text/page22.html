    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation, Eide 41-13-4H was drilled as a Timber Creek well with primary interest in the Middle Bakken formation. The well was drilled by Pioneer 74 ﬂex rig. The well is located in the NENE quarter of section 13 T150N R100W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Eide 41—13-4H was spudded on November 8, 2014 at 1:30 PM CST. The well reached a total depth of 21,555’ MD on December 7, 2014. Geological services began at 9,300’ MD in the Charles formation on November 27, 2014 and continued to TD. Samples were caught by mudloggers throughout the well. All samples were washed, cataloged, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Society in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Total Gas LTD gas equipment was used to monitor gas throughout the well in correspondence with RigSense EDR. <br/>Vertical 9,300’ — 10, 650’ MD <br/>Logging began in the Charles formation at a measured depth of 9,300 feet at 7:40 PM CST on November 27, 2014. Rate of penetration varied throughout the different rock types and formations but averaged 95 feet per hour throughout the vertical section. Gas averaged 99 units with a maximum reading of 421 units in the Mission Canyon formation. The Pioneer 74 ﬂex rig reached kick off point at 12:20 PM CST on November 28, 2014 at 10,650 feet. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Base of Last Salt formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,588 feet, 24 feet low to the prognosis. It was picked by a slight decrease in drilling rate at 9,588, feet MD. Samples also changed from salt that was clear and translucent to off white anhydrite. The lithology of the Base of Last Salt formation was mainly light gray to gray limestone with an even yellow white ﬂuorescence and slow cloudy cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 88 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 57 units with a maximum of 191 units through the Base of Last Salt formation. <br/>Mission Canyon 9, 792’ MD 9, 779’ TVD -7,484’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,792 feet, 25 feet low to the prognosis. It was picked by a high spike in gamma at 9,792 feet MD. Samples also changed from gray, dark gray, cream gray limestone to gray, light gray limestone. The lithology of the Mission Canyon formation was limestone that was light tan gray, cream tan, and cream gray that produced an even ﬂuorescence and weak cuts. Rate of penetration was an average of 71 ﬂ/hr. Gas was an average of 129 units with a max of 421 units through the Mission Canyon formation </p>

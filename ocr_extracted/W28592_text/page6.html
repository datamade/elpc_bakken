    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Qompletion Eguigment Details; Wellhead ~ l0,000 psi rated. <br/>Surface Casing: 9 5/8" 36# .1-55 set to a depth below surface aquifers 2.192 0. (Pb =3520 psi, Pc=2020 psi). <br/>Intermediate Casing: 7" 29¢! P-l 10 LT&C casing (Pb: I 1,220 psi. Pc :85 10 psi) run tojust above the salt intervals (surface to 7,012 ft); and 7" 32# P-l l0 LT&C (Pb: 12,460 psi, Pc: 10,760 psi) From above the salt intervals to the horizontal in the Middle Bakken interval (7,012 to 11,532 it). <br/>Uncemented Liner: 4%" l l.6# P-l 10 BTC (Pb: l0,690 psi, Pc:7560 psi) set from above KOP to the end of the lateral (10,651 to 21,589 it). <br/>Liner hanger plan to set at approximately [00' ghoye KOE at 10,651’11'3 the upper [dodgepole Fm). <br/>A Polished Bore Receptacle is run above the liner hangar. <br/>] he completion method is Plug and Peri‘; with one sliding sleeve in the toe stage. Plan fgr 35 swell packers. Plan spacing is 281' per stage. <br/>Two 10,000 psi ﬁ‘ac valves are set on the wellhead; typically both are 7-1/16" bore valves with the upper valve being remotely hydraulically operated. <br/>Stimglgtign: Slickwgter hydraglic Mature treatments, gill be performed through intermediate casing string. <br/>Typical rates are 40 to 70 bpm; with average wellhead treating pressures of 6800 to 7800 psi. <br/>Pressure Rating: The wellhead and intermediate casing string are pressure tested per state testing requirements at 9500 psi. The ending pressure aﬁer 30 minutes (provided, per state regulations, that it is no less than 5% below the initial test pressure) is then set at the maximum fracture treating pressure. Pop~olT valves are set no more than 100 psi below this pressure; with ptunp kick-outs staggered over a 300 psi interval below the pop-off setpoint. <br/>Per state requirements a ﬂow line is run from the surface casing valve (connected to the surface— inlermediate casing annulus) to a ﬂowback tank. An electronic pressure gauge is mounted on this line and the pressure data continuously displayed and recorded throughout pumping operations. </p>

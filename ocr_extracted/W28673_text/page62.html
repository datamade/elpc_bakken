The lithology consisted of black, dark gray brown, ﬁrm to soﬁ, moderately compacted, carbonaceous, shale with trace gray tan limestone, showing patchy dull yellow ﬂuorescence, and instant cloudy yellow to fast fair streaming cuts. Drill rates, while sliding through the Upper Bakken Shale, averaged 100 ﬁ/hr. The <br/>top of the UBS came in 2 feet low to the prognosis. Middle Bakken 10,848 MD 10,661 TVD - 7,970 SS <br/>The Middle Bakken formation was encountered at 10,661’ TVD. The formation top was evaluated using samples, drill rates, and gamma. Samples in the Middle Bakken formation consisted of a light gray tan silty limestone. Background gas reached a peak of <br/>700 units within the formation. <br/>Three Forks 10,892 MD 10,671 T VD -7,980 SS (Pronghorn Member) </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The top of the Pronghorn member of the Three Forks formation came in at 10,671’ TVD. The top of the formation was called where the gamma cooled down to 80 api. Remnants of the Lower Bakken Shale were exhibited through a warmer gamma marker at the base of the Middle Bakken/top of the Pronghorn formation. The Pronghorn member is in the upper portion of the Three Forks formation and was the primary interest of this well. Initially the formation consisted of light to medium brown, gray brown, medium tan, gray tan, argillaceous, micro to very ﬁnely crystalline dolomite. <br/>The curve was landed at 10,993’ MD/10,680’ TVD at 90.0 degrees at 3:30 PM MDT on July 9‘“, 2014. At this time a trip to surface was made to run and cement intermediate casing. <br/>Lateral 10,993 — 20,420 MD <br/>Intermediate casing was set at a measured depth of 10,792 feet. They began drilling the lateral at 1:00 PM MDT on July 11*, 2014. The ﬁrst run was made with a Reed SKH613M-D1C, six inch drill bit. The target window, for drilling, was placed 5 feet below the base of the shale and extended 10 feet down into the pronghorn formation. Formation dip was initially proposed at 90.4 degrees. For the start of the lateral the directional team had to make a turn as per the well plan. <br/>As they drilled out of the shoe the wellbore started to drop in inclination. At the base of the target window a clean gamma bench was encountered that would serve as a marker throughout the rest of the lateral. The directional team put in a series of slides to steer the wellbore back up in inclinations At 11,800’ MD the wellbore entered back into the target window. The directional team ﬁnished making the turn in the lateral at 12,100’ MD. <br/>As drilling continued the wellbore started to climb in inclination. It was allowed to continue climbing until the LBS remnant was encountered to ensure the 70-90 count </p>

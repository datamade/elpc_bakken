    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation, Lydia #21-14-2PH was drilled as a single lateral well with the primary objective being in the Three Forks Formation, targeting the Pronghorn prospect. The Lydia #21-14PH had been drilled on the same pad, by a different rig, prior to this well. This well is located on the NENW corner of Section 14, T140N, R99W in Stark County, North Dakota. The Lydia #21-14—2PH was spudded on July 3", 2014 and reached a total depth of 20,420’ MD at 6:15 AM MDT on July 16‘“, 2014; thirteen days from spud. Wellsite geologic services were provided by Neset Consulting Service began logging at a depth of 8,150’ MD in the Amsden Formation, at 3:00 AM MDT on July 7"‘, 2014. Samples were caught, cleaned and described by the mudloggers for the entirely of the well. Thirty to one hundred foot lagged samples were caught and saved to be archived at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Total Gas Ltd was used to monitor and record gas in correspondence with Rig Sense EDR. </p>

The Tyler Formation was encountered at 8,264’ MD. The top of the formation came in 37 feet high to the prognosis. The top of the formation was deﬁned by a heat up in gamma. <br/>As drill rates started to decline the decision was made to trip to surface and replace the BHA at 8,480’ MD. The rig crew started tn'pping out of the hole at 8:30 AM MDT on July 7*, 2014. After changing the BHA and tripping back to bottom they resumed drilling the vertical at 6:30 PM MDT that evening. <br/>Kibbey Lime 8, 716 MD 8, 712 TVD -6, 021 SS <br/>The Kibbey Lime Formation was next encountered, samples changed in lithology from a cream colored anhydrite to a light to medium gray limestone at the top of the Kibbey Limes The Kibbey Lime top came in at 8,716’ MD and was deﬁned by correlating drill rates with an offset well and later conﬁrmed by gamma. Background gases averaged 28 units throughout the formation. </p>

The Charles consisted of interbedded layers of salt, limestone, and anhydrite. Background gas was recorded at an average of 28 units throughout the formation, with peaks as high as 67 units. </p>

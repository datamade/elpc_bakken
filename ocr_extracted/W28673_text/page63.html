    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">gamma bench that was being drilled was the middle portion of the target window. At 13,000’ MD gamma heated up conﬁrming contact with the LBS remnant. At this point the directional team put in a series of slides to turn the wellbore back down in inclination and steer it back into the target window. At 13,300’ MD the wellbore entered back into the top of the target window. As the wellbore exited the clean gamma bench back into the 70-90 count gamma bench formation dip was calculated at 90.25 degrees. The wellbore tracked along in the middle of the target window from 14,300 — 15,500’ MD. At this point the wellbore once again started to climb in inclination. It was decided to let the wellbore encounter the LBS remnant once again just to ensure the 70-90 count gamma bench was in fact the gamma bench in the middle of the target window. <br/>At 16,050’ MD the wellbore entered into the LBS remnant and was conﬁrmed by gamma ray. At this point the directional team put in a series of slides to steer the wellbore back down into the target window. Shortly aﬁer drill rates started to decline and at 16,227’ MD the decision was made to trip out of the hole to replace the BHA. The rig crew started tripping at 11:15 AM MDT on July 13*, 2014, and resumed drilling at 1:15 AM on July 14*. <br/>This run was made with an HCC T307 drill bit. As drilling resumed the directional team put in a series of slides to steer the wellbore back down into the target window. At 16,900’ MD the wellbore drilled out of the upper clean gamma bench, and into the 70-90 gamma bench inside the target window. Using the LBS, and the gamma marker at the top of the target window, formation dip was calculated at 90.25 degrees. <br/>As drilling continued the wellbore dropped in inclination and exited the base of the target window at 17,900’ Nﬂ). Using the clean gamma bench along the base of the target window as a reference, it was determined that formation dip had increased to 90.5 degrees. The directional team slid to turn inclinations around and the wellbore entered back into the bottom portion of the target window at 18,7 50’ MD. <br/>The wellbore had a trend of building in rotation so the directional driller put in a slide to turn the inclination down. Inclinations dropped to 88.1 degrees and the wellbore dropped 11 feet below the base of the target window. As the wellbore descended, drill rates started to slow down. The directional driller was able to turn the BHA back up in inclination but penetration rates continued to drop to 70 ﬁ/hr. At 19,57 3’ MD the decision was made to trip to surface and change out the BHA. The rig crew started tripping out of the hole at 9: 15 AM NDT on July 15, 2014. Aﬁer picking up a new BHA and tripping back to bottom they resumed drilling the lateral at 11:30 PM MDT that evening. The wellbore continued to climb but the directional driller put in a few slides to <br/>keep inclinations from becoming too extreme until it was allowed to rotate out to a TD of 20,420’ MD. </p>

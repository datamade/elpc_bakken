The gas detection system was tested before reaching logging depth to ensure that the system was functioning correctly. The logged vertical section was drilled through the Charles and Mission Canyon formations, and into the Lodgepole formation, where rate of penetration (ROP) ranged from 0.20 to 1.50 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas measurements ranged from 4 to 112 units. Round trip for new bit due to poor rate of penetration occurred at 7,645’ MD starting at 5:30 PM CST on December 3, 2014, with resumption of drilling at 1:30 AM CST on December 4, 2014. Kick off point (KOP) was reached within the Lodgepole formation at 12:00 PM CST on December 4, 2014 at 8,890’ MD. <br/>Charles 7,405 ’ MD 7,401’ TVD -5,397’ SS <br/>The Charles formation top was picked at 7,405’ MD/-5,397’ SS. ROP in the Charles formation ranged from 0.20 to 1.50 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas measurements ranged from 4 to 93 units. Samples generally consisted of limestone, which were light gray to light brown, slight reddish brown, cream tan gray, dark gray in part, carbonaceous to argillaceous, wackestone to packstone, with moderately poor induration, fair to good intergranular porosity, yellow green to dark gray ﬂuorescence, and a slow streaming cut. <br/>Base of the Last Salt 7,832’ MD 7,828’ TVD -5,824’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered within the Charles formation at 7,832’ MD/-S,824’ SS. This was picked by the last sample collected in the Charles formation with a majority of salt present with minor limestone and anhydrite, and by a decrease in </p>

The three phases of Parshall 98-33H were vertical, curve, and horizontal sections, with the horizontal section targeting the Middle Bakken formation. Parshall 98-33H had a spud date of December 1, 2014, with geological logging and gas detection services beginning in the Kibbey formation. Lagged thirty foot samples (with occasional lagged ten foot samples to determine formation tops in all sections) were collected in the vertical and curve sections, and lagged one hundred foot samples were collected in the horizontal section. All samples were washed, dried, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core and Sample Library, located on the campus of the University of North Dakota in the city of Grand Forks. Parshall 98-33H reached TD of 14,610’ MD at 7:20 PM CST on December 8, 2014 in NW/NW Section 33 T152N R9OW. <br/>Vertical Section 7,340’ — 8, 890’ MD </p>

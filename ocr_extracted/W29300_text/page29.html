Sum all the individual well "Theoretical Monthly Oil Production" volumes to determine the “Total Theoretical Monthly Oil Production" for the central production facility. Calculate a sales factor by dividing the total “Actual Monthly Oil Sales” by the “Total Theoretical Montth Oil Production” volumes for the central production facility corrected as necessary for any time well was producing but measurement was not operational. Determine “Allocated Monthly Oil Production” for each well by multiplying the respective individual well “Theoretical Monthly Oil Production" volume by the sales factor calculated in step (e) above. LACT meter used in the measurement will be proved according to the section below entitled "Current EOG Oil Sales LACT Proving”. Well oil allocation meters will be proved on a quarterly basis using either a positive displacement prover loop or from a test tank. <br/>Volumes will be reported to appropriate agencies through routine oil production reports filed monthly. <br/>Current EOG Oil Sales LACT Proving: The time between LACT proving depends on the amount of oil sold through the LACT. It is the same for pipeline LACTs and truck LACTs as follows: <br/>a) LACT ships 2,000 bbls or more in a month: LACT proved every month. <br/>b) LACT ships less than 2,000 bbls in a month: LACT is proved every quarter. <br/>c) In addition, to establish a comparative meter factor for a new LACT, the initial proving is <br/>I_IIA..._A L.. _ _--__.l A.....__ - “A‘sL ILA.-.— _-—-—_ll--- .5 L-... _..-I_ .:l 2- -L:___.l 1L--.._I— </p>

This was conﬁrmed with samples and the decision to Sidetrack was made. Attempted to Sidetrack conventionally but due to a poor cement job, a open hole Sidetrack was performed. The open hole Sidetrack was initiated at 10:00pm CDT on 7/19/2014 at a measured depth of 18,878’ by troughing to a measured depth of 18,895’. Time drilling was used to deviate west from the original wellbore. Dip was changed to a 89.78 at the time and gamma was used to correlate with the marker at top of zone and dirty gamma marker at the base of zone were used to adjust the target window. Formation dips ranged from 89.37 to 90.29 degrees throughout the lateral. The rate of penetration averaged 1.3 min/ﬂ, with gas averaging 1,784 units. Typical samples collected aﬂer the beginning lateral Sidetrack were: <br/>95% DOLOMITE: Light to medium gray-brown, medium tan-gray, cream-gray to cream, nucrocrystalline, cryptocrystalline in part, argillaceous, sucrosic, poorly indurated, fair intercrystalline porosity, with 5% Limestone, medium gray, argillaceous, banded, poorly to moderately indurated, abundant pinpoint bright white mineral ﬂuorescence, slow thin streaming cut </p>

    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Procedure for production allocation <br/>a. <br/>Each well will ﬂow into its own single treater. Marathon will continuously meter the oil production, and then combine the wells’ oil production into the same set of tanks for sales. Marathon will do the same for the water production. A third party gas gatherer (Oneok) will have separate gas sales meters for each of the wells. Production per well is calculated as follows (for each oil and water): i. Well metered volume — The production that is metered continuously directly from the treater outlets by Marathon. ii. Total metered volume — Sum of all metered volumes for the comingled wells iii. Total actual volume — Actual production for is determined by the trucked or LACT volumes iv. Correction factor — This is determined by dividing the total actual volume by the total metered volume. This will account for any shrinkage in the tanks. v. Allocated well production — Each well’s allocated production is calculated by multiplying the well metered volume by the correction factor. <br/>Measurement <br/>a. <br/>Notes <br/>Each treater will be equipped with the following meters: i. Oil — 2” Coriolis Meter, Micro-motion F2008 with 2700 Electronic Flow Measurement transmitter ii. Water — 1.5” Turbines Inc. TMOZOO Turbine Meter with a Cameron MCIII EXP Turbine Meter F low Analyzer The gas from each treater will have its own separate sales meter, proved by the third party gas gatherer (Oneok). <br/>Liquids collected from the scrubbers on the sales gas lines will be drained into the oil production line downstream of the allocation meters. Drained liquid from the scrubbers will be allocated based on the oil allocation percentages determined by the above procedure for total site oil production allocation. <br/>Similarly, liquids collected from scrubbers on the ﬂare lines will be drained into the commingled oil production line as well, downstream of the allocation meters. Drained liquid from these scrubbers will be allocated based on the oil allocation percentages determined by the above procedure for total site oil production allocation. <br/>Source gas for: ﬂare pilots, ﬂare scrubber charging, recycle treater charging and recycle treater burner fuel will be sourced from the produced gas off all commingled wells (Source gas lines will plumb together from each production treater to feed the above listed pilot, charge and burner lines). <br/>In the event of a meter failure, well production allocation will be established by a knowledgeable person until the meter is back online. <br/>Once a LACT unit is installed, there will be two divert tanks, only one will be diverted into at a time. When Divert TK 1 is full, the LACT divert will be manually switched to the Divert TK 2. All recycled ﬂuid will be recycled through a designated “recycle” treater having no measurement equipment. <br/>Product Sales </p>

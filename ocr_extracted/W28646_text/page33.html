    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation Hansen 44-28TFH is a grassroots well located in the SE of the SE Sec T153N-R92W in Mountrail County, North Dakota. It is a single lateral horizontal well targeting the middle Three Forks dolomite and blueish gray shale, drilled on a 2560-acre spacing unit. The well was spudded on December 13, 2012 and reached a total depth of 20,260’ at 3:00 AM CST on November 1, 2014. Dave Edwards and Chris Calame were onsite for Wellsite supervision, along with Scott Strahm and Stephanie Connolle representing Neset Consulting Service, Inc for wellsite geological services. <br/>Wellsite services began at the logging depth of 8,500’ MD, at 5:15 PM CST, on September 26, 2014. Two man geological services were used for the vertical, curve and lateral. A Total Gas detector was utilized for gas analysis. Samples were caught every thirty feet throughout the vertical section and curve. Samples were caught every ﬁfty feet through the lateral. All samples caught were saved to be archived at the ND Core and Sample Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical Section <br/>The base of the last salt, the main correlatory marker to this point came in at 8,703’ MD and 8,702’ TVD, 1’ low to the prognosis. <br/>MISSION CANYON 8,888’ MD 8, 887’ T VD -6, 694 ’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon top was picked at 8,888’ MD and 8,887’ TVD a drop in ROP, from .47 min/ft to .98 min/ﬂ a spike in differential pressure and torque and a change in sample texture and color. The Mission Canyon came in 2’ high of the prognosis and drilled consistently with ROP between .14 and 9.47 min/ft. Samples in the Mission Canyon were primarily blocky argillaceous limestone that was brown to gray brown with traces off white to light cream gray anhydrite and medium gray dolomite throughout. There were no signiﬁcant shows in the Mission Canyon. <br/>LODGEPOLE 9,521 ’ MD 9,520’ T VD -7,326’ SS </p>

The Lodgepole was encountered 1’ high to the prognosis, and picked off of differential pressure and torque, and conﬁrmed with a sudden increase in gamma. Gamma increased up from 56.68 API units to 78.3 API units to mark the top of the Lodgepole. Samples in the Lodgepole were mostly light to medium gray tan to gray brown Limestone with minimal ﬂuorescence and dull weak to slow milky yellow cuts. </p>

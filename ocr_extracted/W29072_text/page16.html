    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">THE CURVE <br/>The Tiisto 43-7H curve was drilled with a Tercel MR616MCB 8.75” bit along with a Baker Hughes mud motor set to 2.4 degrees and an invert mud system. There was a 10’ rotation made from this point before the sliding for the curve commenced at the <br/>kick off point of 9,490’ MD. FALSE BAKKEN 10,066’ MD 9,941 ’ T VD -7,587’ SS <br/>At 10,066’ MD the False Bakken came in at 9,941’ TVD, 21’ high to prognosis. The gamma reached 141.37 API units while in the False Bakken. The samples for the False Bakken consisted of cream gray to gray tan, with blocky to platy limestone. The samples had weak milky yellow cuts with a peak of 163 units of gas seen in this interval. </p>

The scallion came in at 10,076’ MD and 9,947’ TVD, 12’ low to prognosis. The gamma cooled back down to 38.92 API units in the Scallion. The Scallion consisted of mostly cream buff Limestone <br/>with slow dull milky yellow cuts. Gas peaked at 56 units of gas along with fair milky cuts. <br/>UPPER BAKKEN 10,11 7’ [MD 9, 962’ TVD -7,608’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale came in at 10,117’ MD, and 9,962’ TVD, this was 10’ low to the prognosis. The gamma reached 617.54 units at this point. Background gas averaged 300.59 units, peaking 673 units. Samples in the Upper Bakken were black, carbonaceous blocky shale, with instant milky yellow cuts. <br/>[MIDDLE BAKKEN 1 0,165 ’ MD 9,9 77’ TVD - 7, 623 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at a MD of 10,165’ MD and 9,977’ TVD, 13’ low to the prognosis. The Middle Bakken was picked based on the change in samples and a decrease in gamma from 634.94 units down to 65.79 units API. The Middle Bakken samples consisted mostly of a light to dark cream gray tan platy siltstone. Gas peaked at 1021 units of gas along with fair milky cuts. The curve was landed at a total depth of 10,285” MD at 9,991.02’ TVD on Monday, December 8, 2014 at 1:00 PM CDT. 7” intermediate casing was set to 10,268’ MD. </p>

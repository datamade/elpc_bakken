    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">LATERAL <br/>The drilling of the lateral began on Monday, December 12, 2014. The wellbore would begin rising quickly following the drilling of the shoe at 94.71 degrees. This was an unexpected inclination. This rise would send the wellbore into the upper portion of the formation and into the Upper Bakken Shale at 10,415’ MD. 4 downslides were put starting at 10,3 53’ MD. These slides would ﬂatten the wellbore out in the UBS and send it dropping back into the Middle Bakken Shale at 10,595’ MD. <br/>The drop in the wellbore would continue and send the wellbore back into the Middle Bakken Target Window at 10,795’ MD. This drop would send the wellbore into the lower portion of the target window and through the A/C contact at 11,160’ MD. This encounter would indicate a steepening in the formation to 89.36 degrees. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">A high side slide was put in at 11,206’ MD to level the wellbore off in the lower portion of the target window. A second high side slide was put in at 11,432’ MD to prevent the continued drop in the wellbore. This slide along with the rise in rotation would send the wellbore up through the A/C contact at 11,625’ MD. This encounter would indicate a further steepening to 89.31 degrees. <br/>2 downslides were put in at 11,681’ MD and 12,000’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. Drilling would continue just above the A/C contact, until a drop in the wellbore was seen at 12,290’ MD. This encounter would put the formation dip rate at 89.37 degrees. A deﬂection up off the lower hard streak at 12,3 74’ MD would send the wellbore rising in the formation back up through the A/C contact at 12,010’ MD. <br/>This rise in the wellbore would send it into the upper portion of the target window. 2 downslides were put in at 12,664’ MD and 12,830’ MD to level the wellbore <br/>off in the formation. Drilling would continue in the A facies with the wellbore gradually dropping in the formation until the A/C contact was encountered once again at 13,57 0’ 1V[D. This encounter would indicate a steepening in the formation to 8915 degrees. <br/>A high side slide was put in at 13,715’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. This slide along with the rise in the formation would send the wellbore rising. This rise would send the wellbore up through the A/C contact at 14,230’ MD. This encounter with the contact would move the formation dip rate to 89.26 degrees. </p>

This slide would send the wellbore through the A/C contact once again <br/>at 15,390’ MD. This encounter would indicate a ﬂattening in the formation to 89.48 degrees. <br/>The wellbore would encounter the A/C contact 8 times in the next 1,700’. The dip rate for this section would average 89.45 degrees. </p>

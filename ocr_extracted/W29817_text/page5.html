Gamma averaged 40 — 70s API, continuing well was in the Basal Clean gamma in the lower half of the geologic zone of interest. Over this time penetration rates slightly decreased and were now averaging 150 — 200 ﬁ/hr. Latest correlations suggested a formation dip of 90.4 — 90.6 degrees, slightly steeper than previous wells for this portion of the lateral. While drilling past 16,000’ MD wellbore deﬂected off a hard streak in the center of the target window. This caused the well to rapidly move down through formation and into the mudstone associated with 1 15 — 1305 API gamma several feet below the base of the geologic zone of interest. Correlations were of high confidence conﬁrming the need to increase wellbore inclination and move back up section. Over the next 700’ MD wellbore inclination was kept a degree above dip and was eventually reestablished in the bottom of the zone. Correlations continued to be good and suggested formation dip had steepened averaging 90.6 — 90.9 degrees. Consequently, target inclination was increased to 90.5 degrees as well as adjusted several feet to realign with geologic zone of interest. Samples continued to make a gradual transition as well traversed through formation. A typical sample showed a light tan brown to light blue gray Dolomite with varying amounts of pyrite. Any potential shows altered due to the use of Enviro—Torq used to minimize torque and anti-foam agents. <br/>Continuing to drill past 18,000’ MD wellbore had gradually move to the bottom of the target window and was determined to be at the bottom of the geologic zone of interest. Well continued to drop in formation and eventually gamma began averaging 120 — 1305 API indicating wellbore was out the bottom of the geologic zone of interest. Over the next 500’ MD wellbore inclination was increased in order to move up section and back into zone. Samples made slight color transitions as well moved through formation and gamma eventually started averaging 70 - 1105 API, typical counts for the center of the geologic zone. Initial correlations indicated formation dip was starting to ﬂatten with dips averaging 90.2 ~ 90.5 degrees. Over the next 1,000’ MD gamma continued to average 70 — 110s API, indicating wellbore was still in the upper portion of the geologic zone of interest. Target inclination was lowered to 90.2 degrees as previous wells on the pad had finished averaging 90.2 — 90.4 degrees. Continuing on correlation quality remained surprisingly good and conﬁdence was high as formation continued to average 90.2 — 90.4 degrees. <br/>Continuing to drill past 20,000’ MD well continued to be drilled in the upper half of the target window. Correlations suggested dips were still averaging 90.1 degrees and the wellbore was are the very top of the geologic zone of interest. Over the next 500’ MD formation dip appeared to change to 90.8 degrees for a few hundred feet before ﬂattening back off. The last few hundred feet of the well correlations suggested formation was toe-down at an unexpected 89.3 degrees. Total depth of the Three Forks lateral was reached at 20,789’ MD on February 8‘“, 2015 at 7:30 am CST. A projection to bit showed wellbore ﬁnished 65’ below center of the geologic zone of interest. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The SC-Norma-154-98—0706H-8 was drilled as a North Three Forks lateral in the Truax Field. As the structure map indicated and past wells in the area had shown, the formation dip was expected to start mostly flat before eventually averaging 90.4 degrees. Overall average dip was </p>

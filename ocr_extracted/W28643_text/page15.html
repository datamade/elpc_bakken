The following assurances apply: 1) The well is equipped with 29#Ift P-110 7" casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11220 psig for the 29#Ift casing. 2) The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.85 * API burst rating to determine the max pressure. 3) Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment. 4) The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flow back than during the frac job. 5) The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates 6) Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases ﬂowing. 7) A 300# gauge will be installed on surface casing during flowback period. <br/>                  <br/>  <br/>                                              <br/>  <br/>405.234-9000 P.O.

These slides would send the wellbore back into the clean “B” facies at 13,769’ MD. The rise in the wellbore would continue and send the wellbore out through the top of the clean “B” facies at 14,075” MD. <br/>A downslide was put in at 14,169’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. This slide was followed by a high side slide to prevent the wellbore from dropping too quickly in the formation. Drilling would continue in the clean “B” facies until the rise in rotation would send the wellbore out through the top at 14,845’ MD. <br/>2 downslides were put in at 14,811’ MD and 14,909’ MD to send the wellbore back down in the formation. The wellbore would re-enter the clean “B” facies at 14,945’ MD. Drilling would continue in the clean “B” facies until a downslide was put in at 15,775’ MD that would send the wellbore through the B/C marker and into the “C” facies. This encounter would indicate <br/>a steepening in the formation to 90.92 degrees for this section. <br/>A high side slide was put in at 15,902’ MD to prevent the continued drop in the formation. This slide would send the wellbore rising in the formation. The wellbore would re— enter the clean “B” facies at 16,477’ MD. The wellbore would continue ahead in the “B” facies until 16.775’ MD. </p>

A downslide was put in at 18,708’ MD. This slide would send the wellbore back down into the “C” facies at 18,845” MD. <br/>2 high side slides were put in at 18,991” MD and 19,273’ MD to prevent the continue drop in the formation. This would send the wellbore up into the clean “B” facies at 19,479’ MD. This encounter would confirm the projected dip rate of 90.52 degrees. A downslide was put in at 19,496’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. The remainder of the lateral was drilled in the rotation to the TD of 20,032” MD reached at 2:30 AM CST on Saturday, August 16, 2014. </p>

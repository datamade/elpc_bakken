Any proposed future project must be evaluated on its own merits and effects. <br/>7. Whether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively signiﬁcant impacts. The EA discloses the direct, indirect and cumulative effects of the Proposed Action. Based on the infonnation presented in the EA, Alternative 1 cumulative impacts are not signiﬁcant (see EA, Section 2.2.2). <br/>8. The degree to which the action may adversely affect districts, sites, highways, structures, or objects listed, or eligible for listing, in the National Register of Historic Places or may cause loss or destruction of signiﬁcant scientific, cultural, or historical resources. Archeological surveys were completed for this project. The results of the survey were all eligible sites can be avoided or have been mitigated by the proposed Project, direct or indirect effects are not anticipated. The Proposed Action was cleared to proceed by the USFS Archeologist. Alternative 1 will have no signiﬁcant adverse effect on districts, sites, highways, structures, or objects listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (see EA, Section 3.6). <br/>9. The degree to which the action may adversely affect an endangered or threatened species or its habitat that has been determined to be critical under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. A ﬁnding of “No Impact” was found for six of these species or their habitat, and a ﬁnding of “No Impact” for critical habitat. A determination that the Project would not adversely affect, contribute appreciably to cumulative effect, or jeopardize the continued existence of any species was found for the interior least tern, whooping crane, piping plover, and Dakota skipper (see EA, Section 3.5). <br/>10. Whether the action threatens to violate Federal, State, or local law or requirements imposed for the protection of the environment. The action will not violate Federal, State, and local laws or requirements for the protection of the environment. Applicable laws and regulations were considered in the EA (see EA, Section 5.0). The action is consistent with the LRMP (see EA, Section 3.0). <br/>After considering the effects of the actions analyzed, in terms of context and intensity, I have determined that these actions will not have a signiﬁcant effect on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, an environmental impact statement will not be prepared. </p>

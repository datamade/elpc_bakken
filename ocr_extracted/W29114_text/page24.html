If the SUPO or PO is sufficient, the reclamation can begin. lfthe SUPO or PO is not sufficient and additional reclamation requirements are needed for either plan, the Operator must submit a Sundry Notice requesting modification to the SUPO and pertinent Reclamation Plan or a similar notice to modify the PO and pertinent reclamation plan. All notices must be approved in writing by the Bureau Of Land Management/Forest Service for federal leases and by the Forest Service for private <br/>minerals prior to implementation. C. Reserve Pits: All reserve pit reclamation shall be completed within six months. <br/>Solidification: Muds and cuttings will be solidified in place and buried as specified below. The Operator shall take all precautions so as to minimize damage to the pit liner when mixing in the ash and/or cement. Class C fly ash and/or cement are the only two materials approved for solidification. No fluid evaporation chemicals are allowed. Use of any other material must be <br/>approved in writing by the District Ranger priorto use. <br/>Burying: As a general guideline under normal weather conditions, the six (6) month timetable will allow two (2) months for the mud to settle in the reserve pit, two (2) months for backfill settling upon pit closure, and two (2) months to complete final recontouring and top soiling. Pits will not <br/>be allowed to air dry or evaporate. <br/>The muds and cuttings must remain within the pit liner with a minimum of four (4) feet of fill or cap over the muds and cuttings. The allowable distance between the top of the muds and cuttings to the top ofthe liner depends upon the amount of backfill material that will be replaced over the pit during reclamation. The amount of backfill material is determined from the cut and fill <br/>plats at the lowest point of the backfill. <br/>The following chart provides a guideline for determining the minimum allowable depths for muds and cuttings. <br/>            <br/>  <br/>  <br/>( If The Amount of Fill In . Then The Muds and Cuttings Must Be The ‘ Feet At The Lowest Point Following Minimum Distance From The Top ls: Of The Liner: <br/>Less Than 0.5 Feet 4 Feet <br/>’ Mitigation Required <br/>        <br/>    <br/>       <br/>  <br/>77‘ 1 Foot Mound <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>7 0.6 to 1.5 Feet 77 4 Feet _ 7 : 1.6 to 2.5 Feet 7 7 3 Feet _ 7 7 2.6 to 35 Feet 7 7. 7 7 7 7 2 Feet 7 7 7 7 Greater Than 3.5 Feet _] 1 Foot <br/>  <br/>Forthose pits that are located on flat terrains and will have less than 0.5 feet of fill overtop, the pit area is to be mounded with a minimum one (1) foot mound to prevent the settling or puddling of water on top of the pit area. <br/>D. Contouring: All earth cut or fill slopes favorable to vegetation or other areas on which ground cover is destroyed in the course of construction, reconstruction, or heavy maintenance will be reclaimed and revegetated. All slopes and contours will be shaped and smoothed near the original contour. Care will be taken to eliminate all potential concentrations of water on the <br/>disturbed area. </p>

The intent of the <br/>Dakota Prairie Grasslands in issuing this direction is that when spills associated with minerals exploration or development occur Forest Service personnel will be informed immediately and have the ogportunity to respond as needed. <br/>Requirements of this notice applies to all oil and gas or other mineral activities conducted on Federal leaseholds on lands administered by the Dakota Prairie Grasslands. Operators on these lands must report all spills, discharges, and other undesirable events in accordance with the requirements of this Notice. The Grasslands realizes there may be spills of a minor nature for which we normally would not need immediate notification, but without the information, that assessment cannot be made. <br/>As used in this Notice, the term Authorized Officer means that officer of the Forest Service having supervisory jurisdiction for the geographic area in which the event occurs. <br/>1. Oil or salt water spills that occur on-site (on the pad) and that exceed one barrel, whether it is inside a bermed area or outside of it, must be reported to the Authorized Officer by phone or in person as soon as possible. These spills must also be reported in writing within 30 days of the spill. Spills less than one barrel do not have to be reported orally, but must be reported in writing within 30 days of the spill. A written report for all spills that occurred within a calendar month may be combined into one report for that month, submitted by the 15th day of the following month. Each spill must be identified individually with required information included for each spill. <br/>2. Any oil or salt water spill that occurs off-site must be reported to the Authorized Officer immediately by phone or in person, regardless of quantity. <br/>3. Any spill of a toxic substance on Dakota Prairie Grasslands lands, as listed and of a reportable quantity as defined at 40 CFR 114.3, must be reported immediately by phone or in person to the Authorized Officer. <br/>4. For a monthly written report, the Forest will accept copies of written reports submitted to other agencies, such as the Bureau of Land Management or the appropriate State regulating agency, provided it contains the required information (see 5 below). <br/>5. In those cases where a monthly written report submitted to the other agencies does not include those spill reports required by the Dakota Prairie Grasslands, such spills must also be reported in writing within 30 days to the Authorized Officer The Operator may use forms the other agencies use. a form. which the Forest can supply, or a form of the Operator‘s choosing, as long as it contains the required information. Exhibit 2 is an example of a form, which may be used; required information is indicated by asterisks. <br/>Failure to provide the necessary notification or reports as provided this Notice may result in other measures being taken to secure compliance, such as those provided by Title 36 CFR 261.10(a). <br/>November 5I 1998 ls/ Larry J.

As a genera! guideline under normal weather conditions this timetable will allow adequate time for the line and berm to settle. The line shall then be reworked to repair erosion, settling, washouts, gullies, etc. The berm shall be reduced and spread to blend with natural contours, and the area seeded with native seed. <br/>K. Time Frames for Completing Reclamation: <br/>1. Well Sites Constructed and Not Drilled: If this oil well site is constructed and not drilled, the site and access road must be reclaimed, or Forest Service approved special erosion control measures implemented within ninety (90) days of site construction, unless othenNise approved in writing by the District Ranger. <br/>2. Producing Wells: lfthis well is a producer, all production reclamation must be completed within six (6) months and in conjunction with the Production Facilities Plan. <br/>3. Well Drilled and Temporarily Abandoned or Shut-in: lfthis well is drilled and then temporarily abandoned or shut-in after drilling, production reclamation must be completed within six (6) months. <br/>4. Dry Hole Well(s) Drilled and Plugged and Abandoned: lfthis well is a non—producing well upon completion of drilling, the entire location and access road must be reclaimed within six (6) months. <br/>5. Plugged and Abandoned (P&A'd) Well: For all previously producing, injection, disposal, and/or other wells that have been plugged and abandoned, the entire location, related facilities, and access road must be reclaimed within six (6) months of plugging. <br/>6. Deepen, Re-drill, Etc.: If this well is re-entered for the purpose of deepening or redrilling or other downhole work which requires a new reserve pit and/or re—entry into the existing pit, the pit and the reclaimed portions of the pad re-disturbed, and all production reclamation must be completed within six (6) months and in conjunction with the Production Facilities Plan. <br/>7. Re-entries of P&A’d Well Bores On Existing Pads: lfthis well bore is re-entered (entering a plugged and abandoned well bore) on an existing non-reclaimed well pad, the new pit and the reclaimed portions ofthe pad re-disturbed, and all production reclamation must be completed within six (6) months and in conjunction with the Production Facilities Plan. </p>

Pipelines and Flowlines: Pipeline and/or flowline reclamation must be completed by the end of the next suggested seeding or planting season. <br/>9. Special Use Roads: Upon the plugging and abandonment of the well, all associated special use roads shall be obliterated and reclaimed within the same timeframes as the well site unless otherwise approved in writing by the District Ranger. <br/>10. Ancillary Facilities and Tank Batteries: Any related ancillary facility or off site tank battery shall have all facilities removed and the site reclaimed in the same timeframe as the related well. If the site is no longerjoined with a well, the site will be reclaimed within six (6) months upon completion of use or notification from the Forest Service unless othen/vise approved in writing <br/>from the District Ranger. <br/>L. Time Frames for Releasing Reclamation: Generally most sites can be released within five to <br/>seven (5-7) years of seeding. However, this is dependent upon three variables: adequate moisture; achieving vegetative cover that is representative ofthe seed mixture and 70% of the surrounding area; and achieving a minimum of three consecutive growing seasons without </p>

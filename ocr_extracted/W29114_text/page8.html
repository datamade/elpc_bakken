A signiﬁcant effect may exist even if the Federal agency believes that, on balance, the effect will be beneficial. Beneﬁcial and adverse impacts of this decision are addressed in the Environmental Effects section of the EA, Section 3.0. No signiﬁcant impacts were identiﬁed. My ﬁnding of no signiﬁcant environmental effects is not biased by the beneﬁcial effects of the action. No adverse effects could be considered signiﬁcant even if considered separately ﬁ‘om any beneﬁcial effects. The impacts identiﬁed in the EA are within the range of those identiﬁed by the LRMP and the Final Environmental Impact Statement for Oil and Gas Leasing on the Northern Little Missouri National Grassland. <br/>. The degree to which the proposed action affects public health or safety. Alternative 1 would not have signiﬁcant effects on public health and safety. The Surface Use Plans of Operation (SUPOs) include thirty-seven conditions of approval and a certiﬁed set of road plans speciﬁcally designed to protect the public’s health and safety during the drilling, production, and reclamation phases of the well. A drilling plan will be approved by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) prior to drilling which will protect the public against hydrogen sulﬁde gas if present. Enforcement of air and water quality infractions is within the North Dakota Department of Health’s (NDDH) jurisdiction. There is nothing out of the ordinary concerning public safety and health in regard to permitting this road, well pad, and production facilities and is addressed in the Purpose and Need section of the EA, Section 1.0. <br/>. Unique characteristics of the geographic area, such as proximity to historic or cultural resources, park lands, prime farmlands, wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or ecologically critical areas. There will be no signiﬁcant effects on unique characteristics of the area, because the project area does not include any ecologically critical areas or other unique characteristics. <br/>. The degree to which the effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be highly controversial. Based on the involvement of the United States Forest Service (USF S) resource specialists and members of the public, I do not expect the effects of the selected alternative to be highly controversial. The opinions expressed by respondents from scoping are considered throughout the EA, and did not disclose any signiﬁcant adverse effects that would result from the Proposed Action (see EA, Section 2.2.1). <br/>. The degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks. Scoping did not identify highly uncertain, unique or unknown risks. The possible effects on the human environment are not highly uncertain, and do not involve unique or unknown risks (see EA, Section 3.0). The process for oil and gas well development is highly regulated by the USFS, BLM, and North Dakota agencies to protect the human environment. We have developed hundreds of oil and gas wells on the McKenzie Ranger District, and I ﬁnd nothing unique to this proposal that poses a signiﬁcant risk to the human environment. <br/>. The degree to which the action may establish a precedent for future actions with signiﬁcant effects, or represents a decision in principle about a future consideration. Oil and gas wells on the McKenzie Ranger District, Little Missouri National Grasslands are not without precedent and are consistent with the USFS policy. Alternative 1 represents a site-speciﬁc project that is not likely to establish a precedent for future <br/>  <br/>— Decision Notice and Finding of No Significant Impact — </p>

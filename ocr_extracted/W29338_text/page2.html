The bottom of the target window was reached at 12,690’ MD, TVD of 10,1 16.5’. Samples at the bottom of the target window were typically: SILTSTONE: Light to medium gray, medium cream, gray tan, light brown, light tan, cream gray, very ﬁne, sub rounded to sub angular, moderately sorted, slightly argillaceous, calcareous, slightly dolomitic, poor intergranular porosity, dull yellow ﬂuorescence, very weak cloudy cut. <br/>Drilling continued at an average ROP of 103 feet per hour through the target zone, slightly exiting the target zone. Reaching a maximum TVD of 10,1155 at 12977’ MD, 0.8’ above the target window. Samples at the top of the target window were: SILTSTONE: Light gray, medium cream, gray tan, light brown, light tan, cream gray, very ﬁne, sub rounded to sub angular, moderately sorted, slightly argillaceous, <br/>calcareous, dolomitic, poor intergranular porosity, dull yellow ﬂuorescence, very weak cloudy cut. <br/>At 13,229’ MD it became apparent that the MWD tool was not reading the correct inclination values, as a result the TVD values were incorrect. The directional driller was sliding down trying to bring the well back into the target window. As he was doing this the inclination and TV was rising, with an inclination of 91 .8° at 13,128’ MD. Gamma ray response values and samples did not match these readings. Gamma was consistently between 70 API and 80 API, which matches up with the lower part of the target window. The samples were also a light to medium cream gray siltstone, not the very light tan siltstone found above the target window. After some trouble shooting, it was decided to TOOH and replace the MWD tool. This occurred at 13,229’ MD, at 12:30 pm CST on December 18, 2014. Drilling operations resumed 15 hours later at 3:30 pm CST on December 19, 2014. <br/>Surveys were reshot at measured depths of 12,950’; 13,042’; and 13,134’. The inclination at 13,134’ MD was actually 8697" and the well bore reached and inclination of 845" as it exited the target window at 13,225’ MD. Before the well bore could be turned around it reached a maximum depth of 10,138.6’ TVD at 13,727’ MD. Once the well bore was turned around, it increased steadily at an average ROP of 173 feet per hour. At 15,345’ MD it became known that the MWD tool was not reading correctly. The decision to TOH was made 7:15 am CST on December 20, 2014. Drilling operations resumed 16 hours and 45 minutes later at 12:00 am CST on December 21, 2014. </p>

The typical sample at the hard streak was: SILTSTONE: Light to medium gray tan, tan, light cream, light brown, cream gray, light gray, very ﬁne, sub rounded to sub angular, moderately sorted, slightly argillaceous, calcareous, dolomitic, poor intergranular porosity, dull yellow ﬂuorescence, very weak cloudy cut. <br/>The target window was entered at 16,613’ MD and drilling continued steadily until an inclination of 91 .63° forced the well bore above the target zone at 16,990’ MD. The well was turned down at 17,241’ MD, reaching a depth of 10,105.27’ TVD, which is </p>

    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">At 10,103’ TVD and a measured depth of 10,322’ the top of the Middle Bakken was encountered. It was identiﬁed by a sharp decrease in gamma ray response, as well as an abrupt change from black shale to tan siltstone. Samples at the top of the formation were: SILTSTONE: Cream tan, light gray, gray, tan, light tan, cream, cream tan, ﬁne to very ﬁne, sub rounded to sub angular, moderately sorted, minor shale, black, dark gray, argillaceous, calcareous, slightly dolomitic, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, slow thin streaming yellow cut. <br/>The curve was landed in the Middle Bakken at 10,465’ MD and 10,113.19’ TVD on November 13, 2014 at 8:30 pm CST. At this point the rig tripped out of the hole to start running casing. The casing shoe was set at 10,451 ’ MD. <br/>The Lateral 10,465 ’—20,440 ’ MD <br/>The well was reentered and drilling operations resumed on December 15th, 2014 at 3:20 pm CST. Inclination of the formation was calculated to have an overall dip of 902° and to rise roughly 80 feet over the entirety of the lateral. The target landing TVD was 10,119’ but the curve landed at 10,113’. An inclination of 88.9 was drilled out of the shoe to reach the target zone. An average inclination of 892° was achieved and the target TVD of 10,119’ was reached at a measured depth of 10,938’. Samples at the top of the target window were: SILTSTONE: Light gray, tan, light brown, gray tan, minor offwhite, ﬁne to very ﬁne, sub rounded to sub angular, moderately sorted, argillaceous, calcareous, slightly dolomitic, poor intergranular porosity, dull even yellow ﬂuorescence, very weak cloudy cut. <br/>After leaving the shoe the well bore has an azimuth of 52° and over the next 1,800 feet a turn was initiated to bring the well bore to 0°. Drilling operations continued to a measured depth of 12,013’ at an average ROP of 93 feet per hour. Inclination dropped to 83.01 at 11,994’ MD, the well took a steep drop and exited the target window. At 12,013’ a MWD tool failure forced a trip at 1:40 am CST, on December 17, 2014. Drilling operations resumed 11 hours and 20 minutes later at 1:00 pm CST on December 17, 2014. <br/>At 12,158’ MD the descent of the well bore ceased reaching a maximum TVD of 10,141 .44’, 14.7’ below the base of the target window and 133’ above the top of the Lower Bakken Shale. Samples at the bottom were : SILTSTONE: Light to medium gray, light to medium cream gray, cream, light tan, very ﬁne, sub rounded to sub angular, moderately sorted, slightly argillaceous, calcareous, slightly dolomitic, poor intergranular porosity, very faint yellow ﬂuorescence, very weak cloudy cut. <br/>The turn was completed at 12,300’ MD and an azimuth between 189° and 353.37° was maintained for the remainder of the well. </p>

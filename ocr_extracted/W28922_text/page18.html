Using this as a reference point, the total formation drop over the extent of the lateral was 32' which gave the formation an average angle of dip of 89.81°. Slides were often implemented to counter the bit’s tendency to walk left in rotation. Total depth for Howo 4-33-4TFH was reached on November 30, 2014 at 20,044' MI) just above the target top. <br/>Samples from the warm gamma facies were generally a light green gray color with higher amounts of silt and clay. The samples with higher amounts of sand and dolomite were found in the multiple cool gamma facies. The highest amounts of pyrite were found in the cool gamma facies at the target top and even slightly above it. The thick warm gamma stratum underlying this cool gamma was described as a green gray to blue green waxy shaly siltstone. Lower in the target window samples showed a more faint green gray color and the cuttings were oﬁen platy (high amounts of silt). Octahedral pyrite crystals were also more prevalent in the bottom half of the target window. At the beginning of lateral the wellbore was below the target window and samples collected from there were generally described as pinkish tan silty sandy siltstone with moderate amounts of crystalline dolomite. Similar samples were also described when the wellbore was above the top of the target window. <br/>ROP was fairly consistent throughout the lateral while rotating but slides became slightly slower with increasing drag down hole. An agitator was added to the assembly at the start of the lateral. MWD quality was not signiﬁcantly affected by the agitator. The average ROP over the extent of the lateral was 102 fph but often over 210 fph while rotating. ROP regularly drilled slower in the well indurated cooler gamma facies which is likely due to their lower clay and silt content but higher dolomite and sand content. There were 3 different bits used in the lateral, replacing the original at the ﬁrst trip due to a MWD tool failure at 13,106’ NH). The 3rd bit was implemented at 18,689’ MD due to signiﬁcantly low ROP of 20 fph of the 2nd bit which was the result of the bit being damaged beyond repair. There was an additional trip back to the casing shoe at 13,3 80’ MD to repair problems with the dynamatic brake. <br/>Natural gas readings in the Three Forks Formation seemed to vary depending on stratigraphic position. Throughout the lateral, the possum belly in which the gas detector sits became saturated with debris more oﬁen than usual which resulted in inaccurately low gas readings at times. Any decrease in formation gas generally occurred in the argillaceous warm gamma strata while the highest readings were often in the more arenaceous cool gamma strata. The cool gamma facies appeared to be the best reservoir rock in the Three Forks due to its low clay content and higher quartz content. Even ﬂuorescence and milky cuts were also more frequent than in the higher gamma strata. The warm gamma facies had low permeability and were generally described as light green gray shaly siltstone. Formation gas averaged 408 units throughout the lateral with the highest reading of 3802 units just above the target top near 20,000’ MD. Increases in gas also seemed to be present near suspected dip changes, which may be due to natural fractures from deformation events. <br/>Conclusion Howo 4-33-4TFH is a two mile south lateral well targeting the Three Forks Formation in <br/>the Big Bend Field. The spud date for the well was November 4, 2014 and the well was completed on November 30, 2014 at a total depth of 20,044’ MD. The best oil shows and </p>

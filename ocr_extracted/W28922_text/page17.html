    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Three Forks Formation was encountered at 10,254’ MD and a TVD of 10,143’. Samples from the Three Forks Formation were described as a siltstone with varying amounts of clay, silt, sand and dolomite. The drilling rates decreased from 82 fph to 38 fph once the wellbore entered the Three Forks. Formation gas remained near the same as the wellbore entered the less carbonaceous Three Forks with an average of just 125 units. The target top was encountered 19’ into the formation at a TVD of 10,171’. Samples from the warm gamma facies were generally a light green gray color with higher amounts of silt and clay. The samples with higher amounts of sand and dolomite were found in strata with low gamma readings (generally below 50 api). Above the target window was generally sandier and it had better oil shows than the underlying strata. The curve was completed at 7:00 am CDT on November 16, 2014 at 10,43 5’ MD. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The lateral began alter drilling through 7” casing with a 6” NOV bit at 10,424’ MD and then entering open formation. The drilling ﬂuid was altered from oil based mud to brine for the lateral. Targets were originally projected ahead with a moderate down dip through the turn and transitioning into a slight down dip coming out of the turn as the azimuth got near the strike of the formation. An overall formation drop of 27 ’ was estimated with most of the drop occurring within the ﬁrst half of the lateral. <br/>Alter drilling out of the casing shoe slides were implemented to turn azimuth from about 215° to 180°. Formation angle of dip early in the lateral averaged 89.6°; however this angle of dip, as expected, gradually decreased to 89.85° with the completion of the lateral turn. This down dip was then expected to be interrupted by a possible up—dip halfway through the lateral, followed by a down dip. Near 14,950’ MD the expected dip change was encountered, but quickly ﬂattened out and transitioned back into a down dip. Throughout the lateral, MWD tools failed multiple times resulting in tripping out for new tools. The ﬁrst trip at 13,106’ was also used to replace the original bit with a new Reed SKH 616MOB2 type bit. This bit didn’t track as well as the original and inclination was more difﬁcult to control. Drilling near the target top was preferred due to its distinctive gamma and easier drilling. Drilling low in the target has shown to be difﬁcult in surrounding wells due to the higher concentration of hard streaks and indistinctive gamma. A thick warm gamma marker in the top half of the target window was distinctive and useful in determining stratigraphic position. Below the target center, gamma was relatively warm but generally more erratic. From 13,900’ MD to 14,600’ MD some gamma signatures had disappeared or altered as the wellbore ascended stratigraphically. With the altered gamma, stratigraphic position was temporarily lost which resulted in rising several feet above the target top of the window. Inclination was corrected before encountering the Lower Bakken shale and started a descent back to the target window. At 18,689’ MD the decision was made to trip out of the hole for a new Security MMD64M type bit since drilling rates had dropped signiﬁcantly. Cool gamma encountered at the end of the lateral conﬁrmed a stratigraphic position </p>

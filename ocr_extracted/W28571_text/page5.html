    <p class="styleSans280.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">After running and cementing the 7” J-55 intermediate casing string, one 6” Halliburton MM64 PDC bit was used to drill Lateral #1 to the Northeast at a 358.77° target azimuth, reaching a TD of 9952’ MD at 5817’ (-4099’) TVD. A total of 26 operational days were required to reach TD after an August 20, 2014 spud date, reaching TD on September 13, 2014. No wellbore integrity issues were encountered during the drilling of Sidetrack #1 and it is supposed based on Gamma, lithology, gas, oil shows and ROP that this wellbore was both a geologic and engineering success. <br/>The Lateral #1 BHL (bottom hole location) at TD was projected to be 4386.35’ North and 177.57’ West of the surface location, translating to coordinates approximately 662.65’ FNL & 1397.57’ FEL in the NW quarter of the NE quarter of Section 2, T161N-R85W, Renville County, North Dakota as seen in Figure 2 below. Sidetrack #1 had a closure angle of 357.68° and a vertical section closure distance of 4389.95’, and produced an 6” openhole volume of 3602’ targeting the 8 foot thick Middle Bakken Target after Target entry at 6350’ MD/5843’ (-4125’) TVD. The Osterberg #2-16 H-1 wellbore was within the Middle Bakken Target for 100% of the wellbore and within the 8’ thick Middle Bakken Target Window for 3602’ of the 3602’ Lateral length, or 100% of wellbore after Landing. <br/>The Sidetrack #1 freshwater mud system varied between 9.7+ and 10.4 lb/gallon with a cumulative total of 175 barrels lost (approximation) in the Osterberg #2—16 drilling operations. Periodic sweeps of Torqueless and Lubrislide were used to unload the hole of cuttings and lessen downhole torque. <br/>T A <br/>3:24  3.3.2,   ‘3: .. a '-  _, V. .~. ' “av-r - 'I.

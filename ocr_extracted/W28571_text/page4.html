    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">GENERAL: <br/>The Roff Operating LLC Osterbergv#2-16 Lateral #1 was successfully drilled by Key Energy Rig # 887 from surface to a TD of 9952’ MD in the Devonian Middle Bakken Target. Lateral #1 wellbore followed the structure up at an overall updip of 0.41 ° to the bottom-hole coordinates in the NW NE of Section 2, T161 N-R85W, Renville County, North Dakota. <br/>This well is located approximately 5 miles northwest of Mohall, North Dakota in the Wildcat Field of Renville County, North Dakota, in the central portion of the Williston Basin. Lateral #1 produced a 3602’ vertical section of 6” openhole volume after Middle Bakken Target entry at 6350’ MD and 5843’ (-4125’) TVD in the 8 foot thick Middle Bakken Target. <br/>Osterberg #2-16 LATERAL #1 DRILLING PROGRAM: <br/>On August 20, 2014, Key Energy Rig #887 began the drilling operations for the Osterberg #2-16 Lateral #1 wellbore. The Roff Operating Osterberg #2-16 Lateral #1 is a single lateral horizontal well targeting the Middle Bakken Target of the Upper Devonian Formation in the Wildcat Field of Renville County, North Dakota. This well set 9 5/8” surface casing shoe at 2089’ MD/TVD and then drilled the vertical tangent to a KOP of 5282’ TVD/MD. Drilling proceeded to 5960’ MD at which point the mudmotor backed off from the drillstring and fishing operations commenced. Because of downhole mechanical issues with a lost mud motor and bit, it was necessary to unsuccessfully fish for the lost directional tools. Curve #1 was ultimately abandoned, and cemented back to 5117’ MD. Moving forward in the Osterberg #2-16 H1, it is important to clarify wellbore nomenclature. The wellbore, from that point, is designated as Sidetrack #1, at the request of the North Dakota Industrial Commission and the remainder of the wellbore from the second KOP at 5182’ to TD will be called Sidetrack # 1. Upon wellbore entry to dress the top of cement, the drill string became stuck in incompetent cement, and the drill string was free-pointed and backed off. Fishing tools were picked up, and the fishing string screwed directly into the fish and was removed from the wellbore. The openhole Sidetrack #1 was initiated at 5182’ MD in the Mississippian Lodgepole Formation with Nova Directional gamma data confirming gamma markers as the curve section of Sidetrack #1 was drilled. The Curve was drilled to 6350 TVD/5834.5’ MD and 89° inclination (projected to bit), at which point the 7” J-55 26#/foot intermediate casing string was set and cemented with the shoe set at 6338’ MD. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Middle Bakken Target was entered at 5343’ (—4125’) TVD and 6280’ MD at 87° inclination. A salt water mud system was used to drill to the curve casing point of 6350’ MD and a freshwater mud system was used to reach a Sidetrack #1 TD of 9952’ MD in the Middle Bakken Target. The Middle Bakken Target exhibited an up-dip, varying between 010° and 065° as drilling proceeded Northeast to a BHL in the NW NE of Section 2, T161N-R85W, Renville County, North Dakota. <br/>Lagged samples from 5182’ to TD at 9952’ MD were examined both wet and dry by Riley Wellsite Geosteering under a 50x binocular microscope and checked for hydrocarbon cut fluorescence with trichlorethylene under fluoroscope. </p>

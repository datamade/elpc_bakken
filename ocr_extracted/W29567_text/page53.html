It is a horizontal well targeting the 2'Ill Bench of The Three Forks Formation with surface spud on October 23rd and intermediate being spud on November 5‘“, 2014. The Java reached a total depth of 26,715’ MD on November 28‘”, 2014. 9 5/8” surface casing was set to 1,940’ MD. 7” casing was set at 11,362’ MD. The mud system was invert for the vertical and curve portion and salt water for the horizontal. Trevor and Kathleen Meyers of Neset ConSulting Service Inc. provided mudlogging and geological services for the vertical and curve. Dan and Lynda Griffin were additionally brought on during the horizontal section. M9 gas detector services were utilized throughout this well, along with Total Gas detection in the horizontal to conﬁrm gas readings. Samples were caught and saved for archive at 30’ intervals during the vertical and curve sections starting at 7,500 MD. 100’ samples were caught throughout the horizontal section. Sample quality was good in the vertical and curve. At times samples were poor in the lateral due to lube sweeps. <br/>Kibbey Lime 7,603 ’ 1WD 7,601 ’ T VD —5,551 ’ SS <br/>The pick for the Kibbey Lime was made from ROP and gamma off the mud log. ROP averaged .82 minutes a foot with background gas of 10 units. Samples in the formation were; ANHYDRITIC LIMESTONE: Gray, dark brown, gray mottled with reddish brown, trace oﬂ‘ white and cream, wackestone, dolomitic in part, argillaceous, poor to moderate induration, tight, no ﬂuorescence, no cut. No signiﬁcant hydrocarbons were observed. <br/>Charles Salt 7, 753’ MD 7, 749’ TVD -5, 699’ SS </p>

The Charles Salt came in at 7,749’ TVD. Backgron gas was 8 units and ROP averaged .47 minutes a foot. A typical sample was; SALT: Clear, translucent, hard; limestone, dark gray, tan in part, microcrystalline; shale, reddish brown, brick red, trace anhydrite, bright mineral ﬂuorescence, faint cloudy cut. <br/>Base ofLast Salt 8,198’MD 8,194’ TVD -6,149’SS <br/>The Rage nfthe [act Salt was nicked nﬁ“ nf aamma WOB and ROP at R 104’ </p>

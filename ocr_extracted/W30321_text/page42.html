It was picked by a slight up spike in gamma at 10,414 feet MD. The lithology of the Lodgepole Formation was mainly limestone that was gray, tan gray, and light gray with an even green ﬂuorescence and weak cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 122 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 79 units with a max of 21 16 units through the Lodgepole Formation </p>

The Sondrol 11-3-3H gamma markers were correlated to the Sondrol 11— 3HU gamma data. Baker Hughes directional team started the curve with an average built <br/>rate of 10 degrees per 100 feet needed. The landing target did not change through the curve, as the offset data was so close. <br/>False Bakken 11,420’ MD 11,2301 ’ T VD -8,800.1 ’ SS <br/>The False Bakken Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,420 feet, 13 feet high to the prognosis. The pick of the False Bakken was primarily done off gamma correlation to the Sondrol 11-3HU curve gamma. The lithology of the False Bakken Formation was limestone that was gray to light gray with an even yellow fluorescence and a streaming cloudy cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 70 ﬁ/hr. <br/>Gas was an average of 329 units with a maximum of 752 units through the False Bakken Formation. </p>

The pick of the Upper Bakken was primarily done off gamma correlation to Sondrol 11—3HU curve gamma. The lithology of the Upper Bakken Formation was shale that was black and dark brown with a dull even green ﬂuorescence and a thick streaming cloudy to milky yellow cut. Rate of penetration was an average of <br/>96 ﬂ/hr. Gas was an average of 2003 units with a maximum of 3019 units through the Upper Bakken Formation. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,532 ’ MD 11,259. 5’ T VD -8, 830’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,532 feet, 17 feet high to the prognosis. The Middle Bakken was picked at the base of the upper Bakken Shale, when the gamma dropped below 100 api. The lithology of the Middle Bakken Formation was siltstone that was pale to medium gray, light gray brown, and dark gray that was fine grained. Rate of penetration was an average of 67 ﬁ/hr. Gas </p>

    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Mildred 7-19H well is a Brooklyn well located in Section 19 T155N R98W in Williams County, North Dakota. The Mildred 7-19H is a horizontal well targeting the center of the Middle Bakken Member of the Bakken Formation, crossing Section 19 and 18. The Mildred 7-19H well was spud on February 18m, 2015 and drilling was completed on March 2““, 2015. Lateral #1 was drilled to a TD of 20,795’ MD. The surface location was set at 455' FSL & 845‘ FEL, with lateral #1 ending coordinates of 237.49’ FNL & 660.23' FEL of Section 18 and 9,867 . 10' N—S & 184.77' E-W from the surface location. Joseph Magnan and Scott Kerr of Neset Consulting Service, provided mudlogging and geological services beginning on December 11, 2014 in the vertical section at 9,400’ MD in the Top Charles formation through TD at 20,795’ MD in the Middle Bakken Member. Geospect Gas Detection Services were utilized throughout the vertical, curve, and horizontal part of the well. Thirty and One Hundred foot lagged samples were caught, washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey core library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Sample quality was poor to good during the well. Oil shows were poor to fair while in zone. <br/>Top Charles <br/>Mud logging services began at 9,400’ MD in the Top Charles Formation on February 21“, 2015 around 1:15 P.M., CST. The Top Charles samples consisted of varying beds of Dolomite: Light gray, gray, blocky, soft to ﬁrm, argillaceous, microcrystalline, poor to moderate induration, along with Limestone: Light to dark brown, carbonaceous, microcrystalline, moderately indurated, and Anhydrite: White, offwhite, blocky, and soft. The lithology at the base of the formation consisted of massive Halite, transparent to translucent, with trace light gray argillaceous Dolomite, with no porosity in the crystalline Halite. Intergranular porosity was poor throughout; fluorescence was even dull yellow and scattered white mineral, with no cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.70 min/ﬂ; and the background gasses averaged 10 units. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Base of the Last Salt 9, 508' MD 9,508' T VD -7,200' SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered below the Top Charles and was picked based on rate of penetration, gamma, and changes in the observed lithology. The Base of the Last Salt samples consisted of Dolomite: Light brown, light gray, blocky, ﬁrm, cryptocrystalline, slightly carbonaceous, poor induration, with interbedded limestone and a trace amounts of Anhydrite: white, off-white, blocky, soft, poor intercrystalline porosity, with even yellow ﬂuorescence and faint streaming weak cloudy cuts. Approximately thirty feet into the formation, the lithology changed to Limestone: Light brown, gray brown, tan, blocky, packstone, carbonaceous, ﬁrm, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered to even yellow green ﬂuorescence, with slow streaming weak cloudy cuts. The average rate of penetration was 0.55 min/ﬂ and the background gas averaged 20 units. </p>

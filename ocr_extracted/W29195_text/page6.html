The background gases averaged 2,057 units with a maximum of 10,000 units. The directional team was able to build inclination and return to target at 15,130’ MD, 11,077.6’ TVD. Once back in window, the formation dip was held at 90.2 degrees as the wellbore moved into an expected signiﬁcant dip increase based on structure data and the adjacent Mildred 8-19H1 well. The drilling plan was unchanged; the goal of gaining TVD was preserved not only to re—encounter upper window gamma signatures but also to proactively place the wellbore in a safer position in anticipation of the upcoming steepening of the formation and progress in the lateral section continued within the target window. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">From 17,000' MD to 19,000’ MD, the rate of penetration averaged 0.38 min/ﬂ. The background gases averaged 1,853 units with a max of 5,944 units. After approximately 17,000’ MD, the wellbore encountered signiﬁcant gamma repeats that indicated that dip had increased and calculations led to a re—projection of the formation to 90.8 degrees. As a result, the directional team responded appropriately and the wellbore remained in the target window as the formation steepened. Another strong garmna repeat indicated a slight ﬂattening of the formation’s dip from 90.8 to 90.7 degrees, which was projected out to 18,500’ MD. While drilling, the formation’s response supported the expected dip based on structure and adjacent well data, and the formation dip projection was ﬂattened again to 90.5 degrees and drilling progressed within the target window with no signiﬁcant change in gamma data. <br/>From 19,000’ MD to 21,010’ MD, the rate of penetration averaged 0.39 min/ft. The background gases averaged 935 units with a max of 10,000 units. Continuity of the gamma data continued and wellbore inclination was held along formation apparent dip with minimal input from the directional team. The wellbore tracked along smoothly with formation until approximately 19,900’ MD when the wellbore deﬂected up and slide drilling returned it to the center of the window. Another deﬂection placed the wellbore above formation dip, which caused an exit out to the target window top at 20,482’ MD, 11,022.8’ TVD. Drilling continued just above the window, with the wellbore approximately 1’ TVD higher than the targeted TVD, as projected to bit. The well reached a total depth of 20,795' MD around 4: 10 P.M., CST on March 2, 2015. </p>

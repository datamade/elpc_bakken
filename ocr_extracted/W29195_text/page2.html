The Mission Canyon was delineated using rate of penetration, gamma, and lithology. The formation consisted of Limestone: Brown, light to dark brown, gray brown, tan, cream, blocky, packstone, occasionally wackestone, carbonaceous, ﬁrm to brittle, mottled, with moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, and fast thin streaming weak cloudy cuts. The average rate of penetration was 0.81 min/ft and the <br/>background gases averaged 28 units. </p>

The Lodgepole was picked based on lithology, and rate of penetration changes, along with a gamma marker The samples consisted of Limestone: A11 shades of gray to gray brown, light brown, tan, ﬁrm to brittle, packstone, occasionally exhibiting wackestone texture and trace sparry inclusions, slightly carbonaceous, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, with slow to fast streaming weak cloudy cuts. The decision was made to trip out for the curve assembly at 10,636' MD on February 22, 2015, around 10: 15 A.M., CST. Reached bottom and began drilling ahead on February 23, 2015 at 4:30 A.M., CST. The kick-off point was reached at 10,640' MD on February 23, 2015 at 4:38 A.M., CST. Based on the correlating wells (Gjorven 14-21H, Rennerfeldt 8-30H1, and Mildred 8-19H), the proposed landing TVD was set at 11,086’, 20’ within the Middle Bakken Member. Due to insufﬁcient build rates, crews tripped out of the hole at 10,955’ MD on February 23, 2015 around 10:30 A.M., CST and resumed building the curve the following day at 1:29 A.M., CST. The rate of penetration averaged 0.93 min/ft. and background gas averaged 55 units with a maximum of 8,412 units. </p>

The samples changed to Shale: Black, dark brown, blocky, ﬁssile, gritty to smooth, abundantly carbonaceous, argillaceous, ﬁrm to hard, brittle, no porosity, with trace amounts of Limestone, even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence, and instant thick streaming fair milky yellow cuts. The average rate of penetration was 058 min/ft and background gas averaged 688 units, with a max of 1,438 units. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,212' MD 11,066' T V1) -8, 758' SS <br/>The Middle Bakken Member was the next lithological unit encountered. The Middle Bakken was picked based on clear changes in gamma data and lithology. This formation consisted of Limestone: Gray, light gray, cream-gray, light brown, soft to ﬁrm, silty, microcrystalline, argillaceous, slightly dolomitic, with poor to fair intercrystalline porosity, even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and slow thin streaming weak to fair </p>

The Upper Bakken was picked by change in rate ofpenetration, gamma data and lithology identiﬁcation. A typical sample was as follows; SHALE: Black, very ﬁne grained, platy to blocky, ﬁrm non-calcareous, carbonaceous, ﬁssile, brittle, poor interparticle porosity, spotty dull yellow ﬂuorescence, thick streaming bright yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.3-1.6 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 13-1319 units. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,604 ’ MD 1 0,5 I 9 ’ TV?) -8, I4 7’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at 10,519’ TVD; -8,147’ sub-sea level; this was four feet lower than expected respect to the prognosis. The Middle Bakken was picked by change in rate of penetration, gamma data and lithology identiﬁcation. Samples consisted solely of sandstone. A typical sample was as follows; SANDSTONE: Medium gray to gray, dark brown gray, dark gray, translucent to clear, ﬁne to very ﬁne grained, well sorted, subrounded to subangular, calcareous, highly argillaceous, poor to fair intergranular porosity, fair light oil staining, with ranging percentages of Siltstone, light gray to gray, friable, slightly argillaceous, dolomitic cementation, faint even yellow green ﬂuorescence, thick streaming, cloudy yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.43-1.63 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 67-522 units. </p>

The surface location for the well is located in Section 32 T155N R93 W, 802‘ FEL & 2,636' FSL. The well bore was drilled from Section 32 northeast with a turn directing the well east through the center of Sections 33 and 34 <br/>to a total depth of 21,340” MD. Two sets of samples were saved for the H-6. The samples for the H—6 were logged and <br/>sent to and archived at the North Dakota Geological Survey core library in Grand Forks, ND. and another set was sent to Hess Corporation in Minot North Dakota. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Vertical and curve 8,100’ — 11,120 ’ MD <br/>Logging services began during drilling of the vertical portion of the well in the Tyler formation at 8,100' MD, at 5:21 PM CDT October 1 1, 2014. Neset Total Gas was used for the gas monitoring program. During the vertical portion of the well, drill rates ranged from 0.1-5.9 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 1 1-601 units. The vertical portion of the well concluded at a kick off point of 10,087 feet measured depth at 2:12 PM CDT on October 12, 2014. The curve was landed at 5:08 AM CDT on October 14, 2014. The projection to bit was 2.48' feet high to the revised target landing of 10,679' TVD. <br/>Kibbey Lime 8,183’ MD 8,179’ TVD -5,807’ SS <br/>The Kibbey Lime was encountered at 8,183’ measured depth; -5,807’ sub-sea level. The Kibbey Lime was chosen by a change in gamma data. The top of the Kibbey Lime was picked off Gamma and sample change relative to formation marker. The Gamma went from variable high values to constant low values just past the marker. The Gamma API dropped from 34 units to 12 units Within two feet. The changes in the samples occurred somewhat above yet close to the marker and were a strong indicator as well. The samples changed from sandstone that was red, red orange with ﬁne grains to limestone that was gray to light brown, off white, argillaceous with traces of anhydrite and was ﬁrm. The lack of ROP made the pic a little harder to make but the Gamma change and sample change were very distinguishable. <br/>Charles Salt 8,336’ MD 8,332’ TVD -5,960’ SS <br/>The Charles Salt was picked by change in gamma data and lithology. Samples changed from limestone and sandstone to halite and anhydrite. Samples consisted of halite, limestone, dolomite, with traces of sandstone, and anhydrite. The Halite or salt typically was clear or translucent to frosty white in color and ﬁrm. The Sandstone was usually a red orange, chalky and soﬁ. The limestone was a light gray to light brown argillaceous and ﬁrm to moderately hard. The dolomite was a gray to gray brown and soft to ﬁnn, microcrystalline and calcareous. The anhydrite was white to light gray and gummy or soft. Drill rates ranged from 0.33-0.97 minutes per foot. Gas in this formation was insignificant. </p>

The Gamma dropped from 51.5 API above the Last Salt to 13.8 API within 6 feet and stayed consistently low with an average of 14 units API. The samples changed from primarily limestone with interbedded dolomite and anhydrite to samples that were primarily salt or Halite. The Halite was frosted to clear, hard and chunky. This was an easy and very reliable marker to pick. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Base of the Last Charles Salt was picked off of Gamma, and sample change as well. The gamma changed from 13 API to 34 API within three feet. Samples changed from salt to primarily limestone and anhydrite. The limestone was gray to tan and crystalline, the anhydrite was white to beige and soft. The Base of the Last Salt was an easy pick due to the abrupt changes in gamma and sample. <br/>Ratcliffe 8,958 ’ MD 8,953 ’ TVD -6,58I ’ SS <br/>The Ratcliffe was encountered at 8,794’ TVD. This top was picked from change in Gamma that went from 40 API to 17 API within one foot of measured depth, and relative distance from the Last Salt according to the geological prognosis. The Ratcliffe samples were primarily limestone with traces of anhydrite. The limestone was typically a light gray brown, argillaceous, microcrystalline to wackestone and slightly dolomitic. The anhydrite in this formation was off white to beige, blocky, and soft to ﬁrm. <br/>Rival 9, 089’ MD 9,084 ’ TVD -6, 712’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">This top was picked from a distinct Gamma signature. The Gamma has a distinct high point of 46 API then ﬂattens down to an even Gamma signature averaging 16 API. This Gamma marker was picked with a comparison log from an offset well that was given by Hess. The samples consisted primarily of limestone that had a wide range of properties including; light to medium gray and light to medium brown in color, ﬁnely crystalline, smooth, chunky, ﬁssile, fractured, sub angular, argillaceous with occasional carbonaceous properties, ﬁrm to hard, had poor to fair porosity, and sometimes dolomitic. <br/>Lodgepole 9, 769’ MD 9, 764’ T VD -7,392 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Lodgepole was picked at 9,769’ measured depth; -7,392 sub-sea level. The Lodgepole consists mostly of gray to gray brown limestone with some cream colored material and also dark carbonaceous layers. The Formation was picked from Gamma and the comparison log provided by Hess due to having no other real changes in the ROP or sample data. The gamma transition from the Rival to the Lodgepole changed from 19 API to 37 API within a few feet. The LP Gamma markers 1-13 were discussed with Hess Geology and came in relatively close to the expected depths due to the comparison to the multiple wells within the area to correlate with. The kick off point was chosen to be 10,087’ measured depth. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">USEPA identiﬁes diesel fuels as any compound identiﬁed with the following Chemical Abstract Service Regisﬂ Numbers: <br/>68334-30-5 (Primary Name: Fuels, diesel) 68476-34-6 (Primary Name: Fuels, diesel, N0. 2) 68476-30-2 (Primary Name: Fuel oil No. 2) 68476-31-3 (Primary Name: Fuel oil, N0. 4) 8008-20-6 (Primary Name: Kerosene) <br/>Whether the well is completed as a dry hole or as a producer, Well Completion and Recompletion Report and Log (form #3160-4) will be submitted to the North Dakota Field Ofﬁce not later than thirty (30) days after the completion of the well or after completion of operations being performed, in accordance with 43 CFR 3164. <br/>Two (2) copies of all logs, core descriptions, core analyses, well test data, geologic summaries, sample description, and all other surveys or data obtained and compiled during the drilling, workover, and/or completion operations, will be ﬁled with form #3160—4. Samples (cuttings, ﬂuids, and/or gases) will be submitted when requested by the Authorized Ofﬁcer, North Dakota Field Ofﬁce, Bureau of Land Management, 2933 Third Avenue West, Dickinson, North Dakota 58601-2619, Telephone: 701-227-7700. <br/>. ABNORMAL CONDITIONS <br/>No abnormal temperatures or pressures are anticipated. Hydrogen sulﬁde (H28) may be encountered in the Mission Canyon Formation at a TVD of approximately 945 0'. Safety equipment will be in operation at approximately 8950'. <br/>A Hydrogen Sulﬁde (H28) Contingency Plan is being prepared and will be submitted under separate cover for review and approval. As a safety precaution, the rig sub-structure will remain open during drilling operations to allow natural convection to dissipate any accumulations of hydrogen sulﬁde gas. Should H28 concentrations exceed 20 ppm, a “bug blower” fan will be activated at that position in order to dissipate the concentration of H28 gas to acceptable levels. <br/>Maximum anticipated bottom hole pressure equals approximately 5748psi (calculated at 0.53 psi/foot at Middle Bakken target depth, 10,845’) and maximum anticipated surface pressure equals approximately 3363psi (bottom hole pressure minus the pressure of a <br/>partially evacuated hole calculated at 0.22 psi/foot at Middle Bakken target depth). The intermediate design casing will be run and cemented before drilling the target lateral. <br/>Reservoir temperature is anticipated to be 244°F. <br/>ANTICIPATED STARTING DATES AND NOTIFICATION OF OPERATIONS A.

The three phases of Parshall 96-3332H were vertical, curve, and horizontal sections, with the horizontal section targeting the Middle Bakken formation. Parshall 96-3332H had a spud date of December 24, 2014, with geological logging and gas detection services beginning in the Kibbey formation. Lagged thirty foot samples (with occasional lagged ten foot samples to determine formation tops in all sections) were collected in the vertical and curve sections, and lagged one hundred foot samples were collected in the horizontal section. All samples were washed, dried, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core and Sample Library, located in the city of Grand Forks, North Dakota. Parshall 96-3332H reached TD of 16,027’ MD at 9:15 AM CST on January 3, 2015 in NE/NE Section 32 T152N R90W. <br/>Vertical Section 7,340’ — 8, 724’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 7,340’ MD in the bottom of the Kibbey formation on December 26, 2014. The gas detection system was tested before reaching logging depth to ensure that the system was functioning correctly. The logged vertical section was drilled through the Charles and Mission Canyon formations, and into the Lodgepole formation, where rate of penetration (ROP) ranged from 0.20 to 8.80 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas measurements ranged from 7 to 213 units. Kick off point (KOP) was reached within the Lodgepole formation at 3: 10 AM CST on December 27, 2014 at 8,724’ MD. <br/>Charles 7,409’ MD 7,406’ TVD -5,402’ SS <br/>The Charles formation top was picked at 7,409’ MD/-5,402’ SS. ROP in the Charles formation ranged from 0.10 to 2.40 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas measurements ranged from 33 to 204 units. Samples generally consisted of limestone, which were light gray to light brown and light reddish brown, gray, dark gray in part, argillaceous to carbonaceous, wackestone to packstone, with moderately poor induration, fair to good intergranular porosity, dark green to dark gray ﬂuorescence, and a slow streaming cut. <br/>Base of the Last Salt 7,839’ MD 7,836 ’ T VD -5,832’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Base of the Last Salt was encountered within the Charles formation at 7,839’ MD/—5,832’ SS. This was picked by the last sample collected in the Charles formation with a majority of salt present with minor limestone and anhydrite, and by a decrease in ROP during transition from the last salt bed into beds of limestone with minor anhydrite </p>

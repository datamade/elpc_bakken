Between the landing target and Way Point 2, dn‘lling involved sliding to make an azimuth turn from approximately 295 degrees to approximately 320 degrees, which was accomplished near 11,600’ MD. The third section of the horizontal was drilled to Way Point 3, set at 15,000’ MD, with a target window of 9,450 — 9,462’ TVD. The fourth and ﬁnal horizontal section of Parshall 96-3332H was drilled to Way Point 4, set at 16,145’ MD, with a target window of 9,442 — 9,462’ TVD. Within Way Point 4, TD was reached at 16,027’ MD at 9:15 AM CST on January 3, 2015. All Way Points were published by company geologist Tony Rios of ECG Resources. <br/>The Middle Bakken dolomite throughout the entire horizontal section was typically light bluish gray to medium bluish gray to gray, spotted very light brown, dark gray in part, microcrystalline, argillaceous, and minimally carbonaceous. The dolomite was also generally moderately ﬁrm, with fair to good intergranular porosity and light green to dark yellow to dark green ﬂuorescence, with fast streaming cuts. ROP in the horizontal ranged from 0.10 to 8.10 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas measurements ranged from 37 to 5,237 units, with max gas value within range observed at 15,634’ MD. </p>

Logging began at 7:35 am CT on August 11,2014. <br/>Base Last Salt 8,690’ MD 8,687’ TVD -6,337’ SS <br/>The BLS was encountered at 8,687’ total vertical depth, thirty seven feet low to prognosis. The last salt layer was approximately thirty feet thick. The last salt was drilled out and followed by a change in lithology to anhydrite with some interbedded limestone. </p>

Upon entering the Ratcliffe, samples changed to a gray brown limestone with varying amounts of anhydrite. Average background gases were around 10 - 20 units. Average penetration rates were 50 ﬁ/hr. <br/>Mission Canyon 8,842’ MD 8,819’ TVD -6,519’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was encountered at a total vertical depth of 8,819'MD, thirty seven feet low to prognosis The Mission Canyon was determined by MWD gamma tool information. Samples observed showed limestone, as the Mission Canyon was drilled samples showed some moderate argillaceous and slight carbonaceous properties with trace amounts of anhydrite in the upper section. <br/>Lodgepole 9,557’ MD 9,553’ TVD -7,203’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a total vertical depth of 9,553' TVD, fourteen feet low to the prognosis. Samples observed showed light to medium gray and gray brown, ﬁrm, slightly argillaceous limestone. Operations for tripping out of the hole started at 6:16am CDT due to low ROP, reaching surface at 10:00am CDT, on August 12, 2014. Operations for tripping in the hole started at 11:20am CDT, after the curve assembly was attached and scribed. Drilling of the vertical resumed at 9,855’ MD </p>

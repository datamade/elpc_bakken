    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The top of the Lodgepole was encountered at 10,083’ MD; 10,064’ TVD picked 5 feet low to prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and differential pressure. Drill rates in the Lodgepole above KOP of 10,420’ MD ranged from 0.4—2.93 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 0.91 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 73-617 units averaging 127 units. Typical samples were: LIMESTONE: Gray to dark gray, light gray, light gray tan, cryptocrystalline, dolomitic in part, argillaceous, fair to good induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull green ﬂorescence, weak milky cut. Curve tools were picked up once kick off point of 10,444’ MD was reached at 1:00 PM MST on February 18, 2015. <br/>Curve 10,444’ — 11,138’ MD <br/>Drilling of the curve began at 5:00 AM MST on February 19, 2015. An initial landing target of 10,879’ TVD was set before curve was started. Drilling rates in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged from 0.13—7.42 minutes per foot with an average of 1.13 minutes per foot. Gas in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged from 62—3553 units with average of 171 units. Gamma ranged from 15—80 API with an average of 33 API. Typical samples were LIMESTONE: Gray to light gray, dark gray, light gray tan, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, dolomitic in part, good induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull green w/ spotty blue ﬂuorescence, weak milky cut. Gamma markers throughout the Lodgepole and formation tops of the False Bakken, Upper Bakken Shale, and Middle Bakken were used to correlate with the Eckert Foundation 152-102-22-153H, Eckert Foundation 152-102-22-15-4H, Eckert Foundation 152-102—22-15—9TFH, with a prognosis landing target of 10,879’ TVD. The curve reached TD of NH) 11138 / INC 90.80 / AZ 3440 / TVD 10887.92 / VS 535.23 at 1:15 PM MST on February 20, 2015. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 10,990’ MD 10,859’ T VD -8,56 7’ SS <br/>The top of the Upper Bakken Shale was picked at 10,990’ MD, 10,859’ TVD picked 7 feet lower than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and gamma ray. Background gas ranged from 163-836 units with average showing 339 units. Drilling rates in the Upper Bakken Shale ranged from 0.57—1.78 minutes per foot with an average of 0.59 minutes per foot. Gamma ranged from 49-255 API with an average of 232 API. Typical samples were: SHALE: Black, dark brown, ﬁrm to hard, friable, compacted, carbonaceous, heavy dark oil staining, even dull green ﬂuorescence, instant blooming milky cut. </p>

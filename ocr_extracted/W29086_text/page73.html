    <p class="styleSans24.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Base 0fLast Salt 9,1 74' MD 9,1 71 ' T VD -6, 527 'SS <br/>The Base of Last Salt was encountered at a measured depth of 9,174 feet, which was 5 feet high to the prognosis. The Base of Last Salt was picked off of correlating drill rates to that of an off-set log, changes in gamma, and a change in lithology from salt to a light to medium tan, gray brown, limestone. The lithology through this formation consisted of a light to medium tan, gray brown limestone. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,365 ' 1WD 9,362' T VD -6, 718' SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,365 feet, 1 foot low to the prognosis. The top was picked primarily off of correlating drill breaks with those of the off-set wells and conﬁrmed by gamma. Samples in the upper portion of the Mission Canyon exhibited a light to medium tan, light gray, ﬁnely crystalline limestone with occasional interbedded anhydrite present. <br/>Lodgepole 9,856 ' MD 9,853' T VD -7,209' SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,856 feet. The top of the Lodgepole was initially evaluated using a correlation between gamma ray in this well and the Cymbaluk #21—15PH. There was also a change in samples from a pale to light tan limestone at the base of the Mission Canyon formation, to a light to medium gray limestone in the top of the Lodgepole formation. <br/>A KOP of 10,160’ MD was reached at 3:00 AM MST on December 30th, 2014. Using the Lodgepole top, and several gamma markers before KOP as a reference, the landing target for the curve was set at 10,632’ TVD, roughly 10 feet into the Pronghorn formation. <br/>After tripping out of the hole, the rig crew picked up the curve assembly, tripped in the hole, and started to build the curve at 2:00 PM MST on December 30th, 2014. <br/>The directional team was not getting the builds that were needed to land in the Pronghorn formation. As a result the decision was made to trip out of the hole to pick up a 275 degree motor. At 10,582’ MD the rig crew started tripping out of the hole at 11:00 PM MST on December 30th, 2014. After picking up a higher bend motor and tripping back to bottom, they resumed building the curve at 8:30 AM MST on December 313‘, 2014. <br/>False Bakken 1 0, 629 ' MD 1 0,565 ' T VD - 7, 921 ' SS <br/>The False Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 10,629 feet and a true vertical depth of 10,565 feet. The lithology within the False Bakken consisted of dark to medium gray, ﬁnely crystalline, argillaceous, limestone. </p>

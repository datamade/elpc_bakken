This formation consisted of gray to medium gray, gray brown, gray cream, ﬁnely crystalline, argillaceous limestone, with trace amounts of a black to dark gray brown shale. Oil shows exhibited a scattered dull yellow-green ﬂuorescence with a slow, weak streaming cut. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 10, 699' MD 10,598' TVD -7,954' SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was encountered at a measured depth of 10,699 feet and a true vertical depth of 10,598 feet. The lithology c0nsisted of black, dark gray brown, ﬁrm to soft, moderately compacted, carbonaceous, shale with trace gray tan limestone, showing patchy dull yellow ﬂuorescence, and instant cloudy yellow to fast fair streaming cuts. Drill rates, while sliding through the Upper Bakken Shale, averaged 100 ﬁlm. The top of the UBS came in 4 feet high to the prognosis. <br/>The 2.75 degree motor was showing build rates far in excess of what was needed. As a result they tripped out of the hole and picked up a 2.4 degree bend motor at 10,712’ MD. The rig crew started tripping out of the hole at 12:30 PM MST on December 315‘, 2014. After picking up the new motor and tripping back to bottom, they resumed building the curve at 10:45 PM that evening. <br/>Middle Bakken 10, 736 ' MD 10,611 ' T VD -7,967'SS <br/>The Middle Bakken formation was encountered at a measure depth of 10,736 feet and a true vertical depth of 10,611 feet. The formation top was evaluated using samples, drill rates, and gamma. Samples in the Middle Bakken formation consisted of a light gray tan silty limestone. Background gas peaked at 319 units while drilling through the formation. <br/>Three Forks 10,770'MD 10,622' TVD -7,978'SS (Pronghorn Member) <br/>The top of the Pronghorn member of the Three Forks formation came in at 10,622’ TVD. The top of the formation was called where the gamma cooled down to 60 api. Remnants of the Lower Bakken Shale were exhibited through a warmer gamma marker at the base of the Middle Bakken/top of the Pronghorn formation. The Pronghorn member is in the upper portion of the Three Forks formation and was the primary interest of this well. Initially the formation consisted of light to medium brown, gray brown, medium tan, gray tan, argillaceous, micro to cryptocrystalline dolomite. <br/>Based off of the top of the Pronghorn formation, a target of 10’ into the formation would be 10,632’ TVD. The curve was landed at 10,895’ MD/10,640’ TVD with a </p>

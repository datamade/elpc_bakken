Approximately 500 psi on the casing. Two other wells on the pad also have pressure. The pressure was noticed by the drilling rig after drilling the third well on the pad. Knowledge of exactly where the influx is coming from is unknown. Consequently they brought cement back to the surface caslng on the remaining three (c, E, 8; F) and were able to isolate the inﬂux. The 9 518“ shoe for the G well is at 2,265‘ and T00 is at 5,510'. The rig capped the wells upon moving off location. Completlon came in to pad prep the wells, bled off the pressure on the surface casing. pumped 50 bbls of brine down the casing to keep the pressure off. and nippled down the caps and installed tubing heads. <br/>           <br/>Other Monitor <br/>  <br/>24-HOUR PRODUCTION RATE <br/>     <br/>Oil Bbls Oil Bbls Water Bbls Water Bbls <br/>             <br/>               <br/>The next step requested to take, is to monitor the backside pressure between the 7" and 9 5I8" casing, and bleed off regularly before we free the well. We will run a free string and continue to monitor during the frac. cleanout, and flowback. Once completions Is finished and the wells are producing. we will monitor. bleed and re-evaluate the necessary steps to proceed if conditions havo not changed. <br/>  <br/>     <br/>        <br/>FOR STATE USE ONLY <br/>1 / / <br/>Date / // r- <br/>m . 47/1,; <br/>Company Telephone Number (303)  9127 8 Jamaica St. <br/>En - iewood CO 80112 <br/>  <br/>     <br/>      <br/>Printed Name <br/>Cole Walton Date <br/>Com letlons En e ineer Janu . 28, 2015 <br/>Email Address cole_walton@xtoener : y.com <br/>         <br/>  <br/>      <br/>                    </p>

Field gas is gathered and transported through the system to OneOK‘s Garden Creek plant (Sec. 35-151N-98W) for processing. The system has interconnections to allow offloading excess gas volumes to Hess’ Tioga plant (Sec. 26-157N95W) and to Hiland Partners’ Watford City Plant (Sec. 6—151N—102W). <br/>See attached plats. <br/>Gathering Segment Name: Blue Buttes compressor <br/>Maximum Current Capacity of Gathering Segment: 35,000 MCFD <br/>Current Throughput of Gathering Segment: 13 000 MCFD <br/>Anticipated Capacity of Gathering Segment At IP Date: 35 000 MCFD <br/>Anticipated Throughput of Gathering Segment At lP Date: 30 000 MCFD [including these wells) Issues or Expansion Plans: OneOK plans for added capacity in this area via the Galaxy compressor station with SOMMCFD (Q3 2015) and another TBD compressor station with 50 MMCFD (01 2016) capacity.

Installation of a liquid stripping plant to be utilized in the event of upset conditions would not be economic. Such an installation will be re-evaluated as additional wells are completed and if conditions change. <br/>A natural gas powered generator could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 30-40 MCFD. A liquid stripping plant could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 40%. On lease gas use by Heater/Treaters will consume approximately 15 MCFD </p>

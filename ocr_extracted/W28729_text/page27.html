Connection to ONEOK finished. Seentlall completed with Delvin Dukart 3 and Delvin Dukart 6_ <br/>  <br/>   <br/>Pipeline Notiﬁcation <br/>These wells will be connected to ONEOK’s low pressure gathering system in Dunn County, North Dakota. Oxy’s acreage that comprises the spacing unit (SU) for the Delvin Dukart 3-3031H~143—95, Delvin Dukart 5-30-311-1-143-95 and Delvin Dukart 6-30-31H-143-95 is dedicated to ONEOK. Under terms of the contract, ONEOK is obligated to install the facilities that are required to connect these wells to its gathering system. Oxy provides (on a monthly basis) to ONEOK a drilling, completion and estimated ﬁrst production date for all wells that are scheduled to be drilled in the foreseeable future. In addition, Oxy and ONEOK have conference calls, usually bi-weekly, to discuss connection status of wells and changes to Oxy’s drilling and completion schedules. <br/>Gathering System <br/>Gas from these wells will be processed at ONEOK’s Grassland Processing Plant located in Section 36, T146N, RIOSW, McKenzie County, North Dakota. ONEOK’S gathering system in this area is a dynamic system that has multiple compressor stations with common suction lines. Gas produced from this pad will have a primary flow path to ONEOK’s Lodgepole compressor station and secondary flow paths to ONEOK’S Killdeer and Little Knife compressor stations. The actual flow of the gas will be based on compression operating parameters and gathering system pressures. <br/>In addition to ONEOK, Hiland Partners owns and operates a low pressure gathering line approximately two miles south of the ONEOK tie-in point for this well. Oxy owns and operates an oil gathering system that connects to the tank facilities at this pad location which has an extra line that could be used to gather gas to increase capacity in the vicinity of this well. Petro-Hunt has a low pressure gathering system approximately 15 miles west of the Delvin Dukart pad location. Hiland’s, Oxy’s and Petro—Hunt’s lines, along with ONEOK’S, are shown on the attached map. </p>

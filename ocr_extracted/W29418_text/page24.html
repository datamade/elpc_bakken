ROP through the Lodgepole Formation averaged 0.7 minutes per foot (86 feet/hour). Background gas readings averaged 130 <br/>units with a peak recorded reading of 258 units. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Lodgepole Formation. <br/>A representative sample: <br/>LIMESTONE: Medium gray, light gray, argillaceous, dolomitic in part, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, scattered dull greenish yellow ﬂuorescence, moderately rapid cloudy dull greenish yellow cut. <br/>False Bakken 10,513’ MD 10,350’ TVD -8,431’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was observed at 10,513’ MD (10,350’ TVD; -8,431’ SS), 1’ lower than the prognosis. This top was identiﬁed via GR signature. ROP averaged 2.6 minutes per foot (25 feet/hour). Background gas readings averaged 250 units. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the False Bakken. <br/>Scallion-Kinderhook 10,523 ’ MD 10,352’ TVD -8,433 ’ SS <br/>The Scallion—Kinderhook limestone was observed at 10,523’ MD (10,352’ TVD; 8,433’ SS), 1’ lower than the prognosis. This top was identiﬁed via GR signature, ROP, and cuttings lithology. ROP averaged 3.1 minutes per foot (20 feet/hour). Gas readings <br/>averaged 250 units of background gas. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Scallion-Kinderhook. <br/>Upper Bakken 10,559’ MD 10,361 ’ TVD -8,442’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale top was observed via GR signature, ROP, and cuttings lithology at 10,559’ MD (10,361’ TVD, -8,442’ SS), 2’ lower than the prognosis. ROP averaged 3.2 minutes per foot. Gas averaged 625 units of background gas with peak of <br/>685 units. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Upper Bakken Member. <br/>A representative sample: <br/>SHALE: Dark gray, black, subblocky, pyritic, ﬁssile, ﬁrm; scattered limestone, light tan, gray, light tan, dolomitic in part, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity; scattered pale yellow ﬂuorescence, instant streaming bright milky cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,621 ’ MD 10,3 71 ’ TVD -8,452’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken top was identiﬁed via GR signature, ROP, and lithology change at 10,621’ MD (10,371’ TVD, -8,452’ 88’), 1’ lower than the prognosis. Total ROP in the Middle Bakken (curve and lateral) averaged 0.7 minutes per foot. Background gas aveaged 400 units in the Middle Bakken with no signiﬁcant gas peak. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Middle Bakken Member. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>A representative sample: <br/>DOLOMITE: Light brownish gray, light brown, light gray, microcrystalline, arenaceous, silty, calcareous, microsucrosic, platy in part w/trace laminations, moderate induration, poor intercrystalline porosity, scattered pale greenish yellow ﬂuorescence, moderately rapid streaming foggy greenish yellow cut. <br/>LA TERAL WELLBORE 10, 745’ MD —— 20,160’ MD <br/>Drilled out of casing at 0050 hrs 18 Dec 2014 at 10745’ MD and began drilling in the middle of the target window and began making the azimuth turn to the south. Background gas over the ﬁrst part of the lateral averaged 250 units with peaks over 300 units. Samples through the ﬁrst part of the lateral were DOLOMITE: Light gray to off white, light brownish gray, light brown, microcrystalline, arenaceous, silty, very calcareous, microsucrosic, abundantly platy (light w/dark staining), moderate induration, fair to poor intercrystalline porosity, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, rapid streaming cloudy dull greenish yellow cut. We then began working on moving down to the C/D contact to get a good dip calculation. The bit encountered the D at 12000’ MD and it was determined that the dip was 90.5 degrees. At this point we worked on moving back up into the target window and took a deﬂection at down at 12750’ MD and ﬁnally made it back into the target window at 13700’ MD and had a calculated dip of 90.25 degrees. Background gas through the middle part of the lateral were 75 units with peaks over 110 units. Samples were DOLOMITE: Light brown, light brownish gray, microcrystalline, very arenaceous, silty, calcareous, microsucrosic, trace platy (light w/dark staining), moderate induration, fair intercrystalline porosity, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, rapid streaming cloudy dull greenish yellow cut. As we drilled in the Middle Bakken target window we stayed in the upper half of the target. We encountered the C/D contact again at 15300’ MD at which point we determined the formation had leveled off and began dipping down at 89.7 degrees. Once back in the target window we tracked the target window at 89.7 degrees in the upper half. Then at 18100’ MD we bounced up and seen the top side of the target window and decided to move back down to the C/D contact. Then at 18700’ MD the formation began to dip up at 90.23 degrees. Samples over the last part of the lateral were DOLOMITE: Light brownish gray, light brown, light gray, microcrystalline, arenaceous, silty, calcareous, microsucrosic, platy in part (some light w/dark staining, some tan gray w/no staining), moderate induration, fair to poor intercrystalline porosity, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, moderately e rapid clear pale dull greenish yellow cut. There were no signiﬁcant background gas over the last part of the lateral with gas averaging 100 units. Then at 19496’ MD the rig tripped out of the hole to change out the BHA due to mud motor failure. Once back on bottom we drilled ahead at the bottom of the target window just above the D facies. The well reached total depth of 20,160’ MD at 2120 hrs 22 Dec 2014. </p>

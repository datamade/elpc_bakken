Once ﬁnish grade was established, a milling machine was used to combine commercial grade Portland cement with sub-grade. The milling machine pulverized and mixed the soil and cement together at a depth of 8". Water was added to milling process, as necessary, to meet optimum moisture content of soil. <br/>Once milling process was complete, a smooth drum roller compacted milled material into place. A motor grader then established ﬁnal surface grade. <br/>Affected area was then left untouched for approximately 24 hours to allow for curing process of treated area. <br/>  <br/>      <br/>       <br/>Hess Bakken Investments II, LLC 701-420-6900 Address <br/>City State Zip Code <br/>58701 Signature / Printed Name <br/>Title Date <br/>Email Address <br/>FOR STATE USE ONLY <br/>    <br/>      <br/>  <br/>November 18, 2014 <br/>     <br/>44 </p>

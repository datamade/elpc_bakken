Background gas ranged from 208—4726 units with average of 2370 units. ROP averaged 0.71 minutes per foot with a range from O.33—1.6 minutes per foot. Gamma showed a range of 40—88 API with an average of 65 API. Typical samples were: SANDSTONE: Gray brown to <br/>gray, light gray brown to light gray tan, tan, subangular to subrounded, moderately argillaceous, fair sorting, fair calcareous/dolomitic cementation, fair intergranular <br/>porosity, fair brown oil staining, even yellow green ﬂuorescence, fair milky cut.

Coming out of the shoe, the initial formation dip was projected at ~90.0 degrees and ~184.9 degrees azimuth. From the shoe to 12,000’ MD dip was held at 90.0 degrees while dip calculations were made based off gamma markers in the Middle Bakken formation. Around 11,905’ MD slides were preformed to work the bit up in formation after gamma showed indications of bit close to the Lower Bakken Shale. The bit was worked back up to the Cool gamma marker before leveling it out. At 12,000’ MD Dip was changed to 9035 degrees while bit tracked between the Lower half of formation to the Cool gamma marker for the next 1,500’ MD. At 13,500’ MD Dip was changed to 90.5 degrees while bit tracked from the Lower half of formation to the Upper half for the next 1,000’ MD. At 14,500’ MD the dip was changed to 90.35 degrees for the next 1,000’ of MD after the bit tracked from the Upper half to just below the Ratty gamma marker in the Middle Bakken. At 15,500’ MD the dip was changed to 90.7 degrees for the next 1,000’ of MD after gamma markers showed the bit tracking from the Lower half to just below the Cool gamma marker in the Middle Bakken formation. At 16,500’ MD the dip was changed to 90.5 degrees for the next 500’ of MD while the bit tracked from just below the Cool gamma marker to the Lower half of formation. Around 17,000’ MD slides were preformed to work the bit up in formation after gamma showed indications of bit close to the Lower Bakken Shale. At 17,000’ MD the dip was changed to 90.35 degrees for the next 500’ of MD while the bit worked back up from the Lower half of to the Cool gamma marker. At 17,500’ MD formation started showing a downward trend with dip changing to 89.85 degrees for the next 7,000’ of MD while the bit tracked the Upper half of the Middle Bakken formation. At 18,200’ MD the dip was changed to 89.7 degrees for the next 800’ of MD while the bit was worked back below the Cool gamma marker to the Lower half of formation.

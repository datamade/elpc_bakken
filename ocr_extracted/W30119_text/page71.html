Petroleum drawn out of sampled cuttings with solvent were consistently instant to fast cuts. <br/>False Bakken 11,248’ MD 11,098’ TVD -8, 751 ’ SS <br/>The False Bakken gamma marker came in at measured depth 11,248 feet and a true vertical depth of 11,098 feet. Drill cuttings sampled from the same depth were black to dark gray shale, blocky and carbonaceous along with abundant amounts of gray limestone. The single sample produced a dull ﬂuorescence and an instant milky cut. Background gas increased to around 4,000 total units at or near the False Bakken, Using the vertical position of the False Bakken, the target was again veriﬁed and would remain at 11,140 feet true vertical depth until the completion of the curve. <br/>Upper Bakken 11,288’ MD 11,113 ’ T VD ~8, 766’ SS <br/>The Bakken formation was identiﬁed at 11,288 feet measured depth and 11,113 feet true vertical depth. The Upper Bakken Shale marker was identiﬁed by a sharp increase in gamma and later veriﬁed by sample. The returned drill cuttings were a very dark brown to black, slightly calcareous shale with no visible signs of porosity or permeability. Distinct hydrocarbon shows, primarily at its top and bottom contacts were present in the form of ﬂuorescence and cut. Gas increases over 1,000 units above the 3,500 unit background value were also recorded through the interval. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,338’ MD 11,126’ TVD -8, 779’ SS <br/>The middle Bakken was entered at a measured depth of 11,338 feet and true vertical depth of 11,126 feet. The ﬁrst samples of the target member were dolomite with slight amounts of sand or silt inclusions, tan to pale brown in color and occasionally translucent. Samples darkened just slightly along with an increase of clastic sediment within, The darker gray, mottled and silty samples veriﬁed that the wellbore was within the targeted zone. With the wellbore positioned in zone and strong signs of petroleum, the end of the curve was reached on January 14*, 2015 at 5:30 am CT at measured depth 11,470 feet and a true vertical depth of 11,136 feet. Landing came in 4 feet above the intended target which itself had made a late shift downward 10,714 feet of true vertical depth. On site geology services would resume aﬁer intermediate casing was cemented into place and lateral drilling began. <br/>Lateral 11,470’ —- 20,681 ’ MD <br/>As it was the second and ﬁnal curve in the batch drilling sequence, the Shirley Moen 4434-3H became the ﬁrst horizontal of the two to be drilled. Seven inch intermediate casing had been set and cemented to 11,460 feet measured depth. Lateral drilling began at 4:35 pm CT January 16‘“, 2015. The top of an 8 foot thick target window was set ten feet below the upper Bakken shale. It was projected out ahead at an estimated 899" based on structure data collected from nearby wells drilled previously and also from the two curves of this batch. </p>

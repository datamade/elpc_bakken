    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">dark gray, gray brown coloring to a light gray to gray, cream gray coloration. The limestone was of a very ﬁne to microcrystalline, soft to ﬁrm, blocky, platy structure. The limestone of the Lodgepole was also argillaceous with no to poor intergranular porosity. It showed very little to no ﬂuorescence with oil cuts ranging from none to an instant diffuse show. Kick oﬁ‘ point was reached on November 30", 2014 at 10:30 pm CDT at 10,650 feet measured depth in the Lodgepole formation. The curve section of the well began at the same measured depth on December, 1“", 2014 at 10:35 am CDT. <br/>Curve 10,650’ — 11,500’ MD <br/>The curve began in the Lodgepole formation heading towards the target Middle Bakken formation. The Lodgepole formation samples consisted of a limestone, medium gray to gray, dark gray, light gray, cream gray, ﬁrm to hard, friable, tight, dense, microcrystalline, blocky, platy, heavily argillaceous, fairly carbonaceous, trace gray laminations, no to poor intergranular porosity with pale green gray ﬂuorescence and an instant thick cloudy cut. Gas levels during the beginning of the curve ranged from 10 — 30 units. The False Bakken came in at 11,276 feet measured depth, 11,128 feet true vertical depth, and -8,800 feet below sea level. Once the False Bakken was encountered samples began showing a medium to dark gray limestone <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 11,308’ MD 11,140’ TVD -8,812’ SS <br/>The Bakken Shale formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,308 feet and a true vertical depth of 11,140 feet. The Bakken Shale marker was chosen based on an abrupt jump in gamma and a drastic shift in samples. The Bakken Shale gamma reached levels over 400 API with background gases increasing to 470-3200 units. Samples changed from limestone to black, dark brown shale with ﬁrm to hard, brittle texture, and a rough, waxy, platy, heavily carbonaceous structure. The shale carried dull green/white ﬂuorescence and an instant cloudy streaming cut. <br/>Mddle Bakken 11,355 ’ 1WD 11,155 ’ T W) -8,82 7’ SS <br/>The middle Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,355 feet and a true vertical depth of 11,155 feet. The middle Bakken was marked by a fast drop in gamma and a change in sample make up. The target rock in the middle Bakken was a dolomitic sandstone/dolomite that was gray to pale gray, soﬁ to ﬁrm, very ﬁne grained, slightly argillaceous, sub-rounded, poor to fair intergranular porosity, dolomite, dark brown, dark gray, gritty in part, blocky, solid light yellow ﬂuorescence, instant cloudy yellow green cut. Gas levels through this formation were approximately 650-] ,200 units. The planned landing point of 11,500 feet measured depth was achieved with a true vertical depth of 11,173 feet. The End of Curve was reached on December 15‘, 2014, at 10:00 pm CDT within the Bakken formation’s middle member. Once the landing depth was reached, drilling ceased to set and cement casing into the wellbore. The seven inch casing was set at 11,490 feet measured depth, 14 vertical feet into the middle Bakken. The curve portion of the wellbore was successfully drilled to target depth without any trips out of hole. </p>

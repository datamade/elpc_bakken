After this well’s curve was completed and easing had been set to 11,490 feet measured depth, the Pioneer 77 rig was walked 45 feet north to the Rovelstad 21-13-3H. That well was drilled to completion before the rig was walked back to drill the lateral segment of the Rovelstad 21-13HU. This pair represented the third and fourth middle Bakken lateral at this location. <br/>Lateral 11,500’ -—21,670’MD <br/>On December 18*, 2014 at 7:50 pm CT, lateral drilling began on the Rovelstad 21-13HU. The bit exited casing into formation positioned on the bottom line of an eight foot target window that had been projected at an estimated 90.15°. Slide drilling to achieve a planned 65° directional turn to 180° due south began immediately while the wellbore lost inclination and slipped below the target window. Gamma data along with sampled cuttings of gray sand/siltstone veriﬁed the target’s correct position. Initial petroleum shows were modest to good in sampled cuttings and total gas values were low with an average of 355 total units. <br/>By measured depth 13,600 feet the wellbore was at an azimuth heading of 180° as directed by the well plan. Over the course of the ﬁrst segment, the tool assembly held a position low to the target window for 75% of that length. Five hundred feet before completing the turn, the bit crossed the bottom target line and up into the window. The gamma marker that is the lower line of zone was used to calculate a 904° angle and later reﬁned to 902°. Over the next I/4 length of the lateral, the wellbore tracked high and within the target zone. <br/>Lithology seen in drill cuttings were tan to translucent brown, sucrosic in texture dolomite containing little to no clastic inclusions. After the wellbore had been established higher in the column, petroleum shows improved with stronger residual signs on samples and a noted increase in background gasses from 350 to 840 total units. This interval also produced gas kicks reaching 1,000 to 2,000 total units and a massive one reaching just over 9,000 total units. The signiﬁcant increase in hydrocarbons higher within the middle Bakken were a noted characteristic in the adjacent lateral drilled days earlier and others in this ﬁeld. While tracking high within the target, at measured depth 17,443 feet, the bit became packed off and required a trip to surface for tools. The trip began at 7:00 am on December 21“, 2014 and lateral drilling resumed later the same day at 9:45 pm CT. </p>

Gamma data and eventually samples once again veriﬁed the vertical placement of the target’s bottom line. Cuttings recovered for review increased in dark gray detrital sediment eventually becoming dolomitic sand/silt stone. This gradation ﬁom one lithology to the other occurred as hydrocarbon shows faded slightly as well. Backgron gas values maintained an average of 700 total units however, gas kicks over 1,000 went from occurring frequently down to one. That one kick came as the wellbore returned up into the bottom of zone. The elastic lithology continued showing strong signs of residual petroleum through this interval low to the target, while the overall quality of sample declined greatly. </p>

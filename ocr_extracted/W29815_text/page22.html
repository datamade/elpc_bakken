The drop out and back into zone had also provided gamma data that indicated a sharp increase in formation dip-angle. A new target was projected at 905° and would only taper off slightly near the end of the lateral. Slide drilling became more frequent and aggressive over the ﬁnal two thousand feet. As a result of these efforts the wellbore tracked the bottom line of the target out to measured depth 20,000 feet. At which point the inclination was brought up enough to raise the wellbore to the center of zone. Another successful liﬁ of the assembly’s inclination came at measured depth 21,000 feet. Soon afterward, the wellbore reached the top line of the 8 foot target window. <br/>The contact with the target’s top line returned gamma data that indicated a change in the formation angle. A new target of 903° was applied for the remaining length of the lateral. The change shiﬁed the zone down leaving the wellbore high to the top line. The wellbore was lowered back into the new target by measured depth 21,500 feet, shortly before reaching total depth of the well. Samples from these depths had been heavily degraded chemically and mechanically. They did however resemble the lithology expected high within the middle Bakken. <br/>On December 23'“, 2014 at 8:00 pm CT total depth of the Rovelstad 21-13HU was reached with a measured depth of 21,670 feet and a projected true vertical depth of 11,124 feet. The ﬁnal 5,000 feet of the lateral wellbore is a good representation of the of the middle Bakken pay zone within the Timber Creek ﬁeld and beyond. The lowering out of zone and eventual reentry of the target over this interval is synchronized to kicks of gas. These notable gas kicks would ﬁ'equently reached over 3,500 total units and stopped when the wellbore fell low to the target. The strong kicks of gas returned with greater frequency as the wellbore crossed back, up into zone and culminated with a ﬁnal spike of over 9,200 units of total gas as total depth was reached and wellbore positioned high within the target. <br/>The bottom extent of the target window is darker in color as a result of increasing clastic sediment contained within, and is not void of petroleum. The upper half of the 8 vertical foot target and its tan to translucent brown, cleaner dolomite lithology produced hydrocarbon shows superior to the shows of the lower half of the middle Bakken member. This sequence of lithology and location of hydrocarbon reserves within is considered by this writer to be a dominate trait of this ﬁeld and other adjacent ﬁelds of the Bakken Formation. <br/>John Nygard Wellsite Geologist </p>

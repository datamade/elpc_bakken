The well is located in the Timber Creek Field situated 210' FNL 1,880' FWL, NE NW Section 13 T150N RIOOW in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation Rovelstad 21-13HU spudded on November 26th 2014. A total measured depth of 21,670 feet was reached on December 23‘“, 2014. 9 5/8 inch surface casing was set at 2,276 feet measured depth, and 7 inch intermediate casing to 11,490 feet measured depth into the middle Bakken. The lateral portion of the well was drilled out with a 6 inch Security bit. The mud system was watched by Joe Vaith of NOV Fluid Control. Halliburton - Sperry arrived prior to surface drilling operations to provide directional and measurement services for the well. Oil based invert mud was used during the vertical and curve sections of the well, and salt water brine was used during the surface and lateral sections. Justin Peterson, John Nygard and Brandon Christianson were contracted by Neset Consulting Service provided mud logging and geological services as well as gas monitoring. <br/>Wellsite geological services began on November 30th, 2014 at 10:26 am CDT at 9,350 feet measured depth and continued through to TD of the lateral. Total Gas and RigSense EDR logging system services were utilized throughout this well for monitoring the gas and providing drilling parameters. The Kelly Bushing for the Rovelstad 21-13HU well was 2,328 feet and the ground elevation was 2,303 feet above sea level. Thirty foot sample intervals in the vertical/curve with ﬁfty to one hundred foot sample intervals caught in the lateral. They were cleaned and cataloged to be archived at The North Dakota Geological Survey's Wilson M. Laird Core and Sample Library on the University of North Dakota Campus in Grand Forks. <br/>Vertical Wellbore <br/>Mudlogging began at 9,350 feet measured depth on November 30th in the Charles formation. Salt was the dominate rock throughout the Charles formation, along with intervals of anhydrite and limestone. The Last Salt was encountered at 9,579 feet true vertical depth. The lithology of the upper portion of the Charles was primarily salt, with intervals of a cream, off white, white, very soft, gummy anhydrite. Samples towards the base of the Charles formation changed over to a light gray brown, gray to light gray, light brown, carbonaceous, argillaceous, very soﬁ to soﬁ, gummy/pasty limestone. <br/>Lodgepole 10,342 ’ MD 10,331 ’ TVD -8, 003 ’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole formation was encountered at a measured depth of 10,342 feet, 10,331 feet true vertical depth, and a sub-sea elivation of—8,003 feet. The Lodgepole formation was picked based on a slight change in sample coloration, change in penetration rates, and gamma data. The color of the limestone transitioned from a medium to </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Mission Canyon formation top was picked at 7,949’ MD/-5,993’ SS, and was picked from lithology change and a temporary increase in ROP when transitioning from the Charles formation limestone into Mission Canyon limestone. ROP in the Mission Canyon ranged from 0.40 to 3.20 minutes per foot, and gas measurements ranging from 17 to 206 units. Samples generally consisted of limestone which was medium to light and dark gray, medium to light and dark brown, packstone to wackestone, moderately argillaceous, moderately carbonaceous, moderately well indurated, fair intergranular porosity, light to dark green and dark gray ﬂuorescence, with slow to fast streaming cuts. <br/>Lodgepole 8,541 ’ MD 8,538’ TVD -6,585 ’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole formation top was picked at 8,541’ MD/-6,585’ SS, where samples changed from a light to medium brown and gray limestone to a medium to dark gray limestone. ROP in the Lodgepole ranged from 0.20 to 8.80 minutes per foot, with gas measurements ranging from 37 to 1,046 units. Samples generally consisted of limestone which was medium to dark and light gray, brown to light brown in part, argillaceous, wackestone, silty, slightly carbonaceous, moderately well indurated, fair to good intergranular porosity, light green to dark green/gray ﬂuorescence, with moderately fast streaming cuts. <br/>Curve Section 8,830’ — 9,582 ’ MD <br/>The curve section of Parshall 91-28H began 289 feet into the Lodgepole formation at a KOP of 8,830’ MD. Directional tools were picked up on September 15, 2014, and the curve was started at 1:40 PM on September 15, 2014. Drilling rates in the curve ranged from 0.20 to 8.80 minutes per foot while sliding and rotating, and gas measurements ranged from 37 to 1,046 units. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the curve to correlate Parshall 91-28H with Parshall 11-28H. </p>

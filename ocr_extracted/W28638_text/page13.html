    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">EOG Resources Parshall 91-28H is a horizontal well located in the NW/NW Section 28 T152N R90W in Mountrail County, North Dakota, and was drilled by H&P 316, with surface and Kelly bushing elevations of 1,929’ and 1,953’ respectively. The three phases of Parshall 91-28H were vertical, curve, and horizontal sections, with the horizontal section targeting the Middle Bakken formation. Parshall 91-28H had a spud date of September 11, 2014, with geological logging and gas detection services beginning at 7,280’ measured depth (MD) in the Kibbey formation. Lagged thirty foot samples (with occasional lagged ten foot samples to determine formation tops in all sections) were collected in the vertical and curve sections, and lagged one hundred foot samples were collected in the horizontal section. All samples were washed, dried, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core and Sample Library, located on the campus of the University of North Dakota in the city of Grand Forks. EOG Resources Parshall 91-28H reached a total depth (TD) of 14,707’ MD at 6:00 PM on September 20, 2014. <br/>Vertical Section 7,280’ — 8, 83 0’ MD </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Logging services began at 7,280’ MD in the bottom of the Kibbey formation on September 13, 2014. The gas detection system was tested before reaching logging depth to ensure that the system was functioning correctly. The logged vertical section was drilled through the Charles and Mission Canyon formations, and into the Lodgepole formation, where rate of penetration (ROP) ranged from 0.30 to 3.80 minutes per foot, and gas measurements ranged from 17 to 313 units. Kick off point (KOP) was reached within the Lodgepole formation at 12: 15 AM on September 15, 2014 at 8,830’ MD. <br/>Charles 7,362 ’ MD 7,359’ T VD -5,406’ SS <br/>The Charles formation top was picked at 7,362’ MD/-5,406’ SS. ROP in the Charles formation ranged from 0.30 to 3.20 minutes per foot, and gas measurements ranged from 18 to 280 units. At 7,508’ MD within the Charles formation, a trip out of the hole for a new bit occurred due to poor rate of penetration at 1:30 AM on September 14, 2014, and drilling resumed at 9:30 AM on September 14, 2014. Samples generally consisted of limestone which was light gray to light brown, slight reddish brown, cream tan gray, dark gray in part, carbonaceous to argillaceous, wackestone to packstone, with moderately poor induration, fair to good intergranular porosity, yellow green to dark gray ﬂuorescence, and a slow streaming cut. <br/>Base of the Last Salt 7, 774’ MD 7, 771 ’ TVD -5,818 ’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered within the Charles formation at 7,774’ MD/-5,818’ SS. This was picked by the last sample collected in the Charles formation with a majority of salt present with minor limestone and anhydrite, and by a decrease in ROP during transition from the last salt bed into beds of limestone with minor anhydrite </p>

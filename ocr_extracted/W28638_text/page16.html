    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">limestone into softer shale, and ﬁnally determined when gamma values dramatically increased as the gamma tool entered the UBS, with the gamma tool being 49 feet behind the drill bit. ROP in the UBS ranged from 0.20 to 3.60 minutes per foot, with gas measurements ranging from 270 to 1,031 units. Here shale samples were generally dull black to very dark gray and very dark brown, blocky, ﬁssile, carbonaceous, spotted dark yellow to dark green to black ﬂuorescence, with instant to fast blooming milky cuts. The curve section landed in the Middle Bakken at an 85.70° angle at 9,582' MD/9,335.03’ TVD on September 16, 2014 at 3:00 PM. The ﬁnal curve TD depth of 9,582’ MD was conﬁrmed when the bottoms up sample at this depth contained bluish gray Middle Bakken dolomite with trace black Upper Bakken shale. <br/>Horizontal Section <br/>Aﬁer tripping in the hole with a new drilling assembly, drilling began in the horizontal section at 4:00 AM on September 18, 2014. The Middle Bakken top was ofﬁcially determined at 9,553’ MD/-7,378’ SS from a decrease in gamma values as the gamma tool transitioned from the UBS into the Middle Bakken dolomite. The curve was generally leveled off within the drilling window at a ~90° angle near survey depth of 10,587’ MD, and the GR Marker was ﬁrst encountered at 10,382’ MD/-7,398’ SS. The formation dip angle from 9,600’ — 12,000’ MD averaged 89.80 degrees, and then ﬂattened to ~90 degrees from 12,000’ — 12,900’ MD. The formation dip angle then averaged 89.95 degees from 12,900 to TD of 14,707’ MD. </p>

The dolomite was also generally moderately ﬁrm, with fair to good intergranular porosity and light green to dark yellow to dark green and dark gray ﬂuorescence, with mostly fast streaming cuts. ROP in the horizontal ranged from 0.20 to 13.70 minutes per foot, and <br/>gas measurements ranged from 22 to 1,769 units, with max gas value within range observed at 10,437’ MD. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The ﬁrst section of the horizontal for Parshall 91-28H was drilled to Way Point 1, set at 11,000’ MD, with a target window of 9,350 — 9,362’ TVD. The second section of the horizontal was drilled to Way Point 2, set at 12,000’ MD, with a target window of 9,354 — 9,366’ TVD. Within Way Point 2, drilling involved sliding to make an azimuth turn from approximately 165 degrees to approximately 136 degrees, which was accomplished by ~11,300’ MD. Also within Way Point 2, the GR Marker was encountered at 10,999’ MD/-7,401’ SS. </p>

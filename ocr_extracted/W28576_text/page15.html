A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Medium gray to gray, light brown, soft to ﬁrm, chalky, microcrystalline, moderate to good induration, poor porosity, highly calcareous, moderately argillaceous, dolomitic, light brown to tan, light gray, even yellow green ﬂuorescence, instant cloudy yellow cut. Drill rates in the Lodgepole ranged from 0.1-6.5 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 34—286 units. The kick off point was chosen to be 10,240’ measured depth. <br/>False Bakken 10,544 ’ MD 10,486 ’ TVD -8,II4’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was encountered at 10,486’ TVD; -8,l 14’ sub-sea level; this was eight feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. The False Bakken was picked from change in gamma data and drill rates. One sample was processed and was as follows; LIMESTONE: Medium gray, light to medium tan, soft to ﬁrm, chalky, microcrystalline, moderate to good induration, poor porosity, calcareous, moderately argillaceous, dolomitic, light brown to brown, light gray, faint even yellow green ﬂuorescence, cloudy yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.3-1 .4 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 140-297 units. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Upper Bakken Shale was encountered at 10,497’ TVD; —8,125’ sub-sea level; this was six feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. The Upper Bakken was picked by change in rate of penetration, gamma data and lithology identiﬁcation. A typical sample was as follows; SHALE: Black, very ﬁne grained, platy to blocky, ﬁrm non—calcareous, carbonaceous, ﬁssile, brittle, poor intergranular porosity, 10% Limestone, light to medium gray, microcrystalline, ﬁrm to brittle, highly argillaceous, dolomitic, poor intercrystalline porosity, spotty dull yellow ﬂuorescence, thick streaming bright yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.2-5.2 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 67—292 units. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,582 ’ MD 10,516 ’ T VD -8,144 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at 10,516’ TVD; —8,144’ sub-sea level; this was four feet lower than expected respect to the prognosis. The Middle Bakken was picked by change in rate of penetration, gamma data and lithology identiﬁcation. Samples consisted solely of sandstone. A typical sample was as follows; SANDSTONE: Medium gray to gray, dark brown gray, dark gray, translucent to clear, ﬁne to very ﬁne grained, well sorted, subrounded to subangular, calcareous, highly argillaceous, poor to fair intergranular porosity, fair light oil staining, 40% Siltstone, light gray to gray, friable, slightly argillaceous, dolomitic cementation, faint even yellow green ﬂuorescence, thick streaming, cloudy yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.7-3.4 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 79-3 82 units. <br/>Lower Bakken Shale 10,69 7'MD I 0,591' T VD -8,219' SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale was encountered at 10,591 ’ TVD; —8,219’ sub-sea level; this was seven feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. The Lower Bakken Shale was picked by change in rate of penetration, gamma data and lithology identiﬁcation. Samples consisted solely of shale. A typical sample was as follows; SHALE: Medium to dark gray, soft to ﬁrm, ﬁssile to blocky, carbonaceous, trace limestone, light to medium gray, brown, gray, microcrystalline, ﬁrm to brittle, highly argillaceous, dolomitic limestone in part, poor intercrystalline porosity, scattered pinpoint dull yellow ﬂuorescence, thick cloudy yellow—brown cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.3-1.5 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between <br/>101-612 units. </p>

Produced gas from this well will be used as lease fuel to ﬁre a heater-treater to heat the produced ﬂuid and facilitate separation of the oil. water and gas. In addition, produced gas will be used to provide fuel for a natural gas engine which will power a well pumping unit. An alternate system available to reduce the amount of gas that is ﬂared is a turboexpansion NGL recovery unit. <br/>b. Using produced gas to ﬁre a heater-treater and provide fuel for a natural gas engine which will power a well pumping unit consumes up to 76% of the gas produced. A turboexpansion NGL recovery unit would reduce the remaining gas to be ﬂared (after that used for lease fuel and that sold to Nextera Energy “Inc.) by approximately 15%. </p>

ROP through the last salt bench averaged llOfph which slowed to 69fph and became erratic in underlain limestone and anhydrite units. <br/>The kick off point (KOP) for the curve and a preliminary target for the curve landing were calculated using the depth of the BLS. An estimated isopach thickness of 1,725 ’ from the BLS to the expected Three Forks target provided a preliminary target of 10,159’ TVD and the planned curve radius of 477’ provided a KOP of 9,682’. The calculations were based on landing the curve at the target center. <br/>Mission Canyon 8,607’ MD 8,606’ TVD -6, 700’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Mission Canyon Formation was seen at 8,607’ MD. Its depth was established due to gamma data from the MWD tool. Subtle changes in lithology and drilling signatures were also useful in establishing the depth of the Mission Canyon. ROP in the formation averaged 61fph while formation gas averaged 240 units. Near the top of the formation, samples were less carbonaceous and signiﬁcantly more anhydritie than underlying stratum. The rate of penetration was slightly slower in the anhydrite units. Off-set wells showed indications of a more porous interval with signiﬁcant increases in formation gas. Near 8,800’ MD formation gas increase to 360 units and grain content was relatively high. Samples showed subtle changes in clay and carbon content several times before reaching the top of the Lodgepole Formation. <br/>Lodgepole 9,214 ’ MD 9,213 ’ TVD -7,307’ SS <br/>The depth of the Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a MD of 9,414’. As the Lodgepole was encountered, a lithology change from a brown carbonaceous limestone to a predominantly gray crystalline and argillaceous limestone was identiﬁed. The most distinctive change was ratty drilling signatures from leaving the elastic Mission Canyon limestone and entering the more crystalline Lodgepole dolomitic limestone. It was not only ROP and gamma that deﬁned the formation but also differential pressure, rotary, torque and weight on bit. Drill rates through the formation in the vertical segment averaged 53fph while gas remained relatively invariable at 125 units. Samples oﬁen had spotty to patchy yellow green ﬂuorescence with slow blooming to streaming cuts. KOP was reached at 9:00 am CDT on September 25, 2014 at a measured depth of 9,682’. <br/>Curve 9,682’ - 10,503’ MD <br/>The curve process began after tripping out to add an Ulterra U516M type bit, a ﬁxed 2.5° DDC motor and MWD tools. Drilling resumed at 9,682’ MD at 8:00 pm CDT on September 25, 2014. This assembly was used for the remainder of the curve and averaged 40fph. The lower Lodgepole was found to be more argillaceous, silty, and carbonaeeous than the overlying Lodgepole. The best oil shows were also in the lower Lodgepole. During the curve, formation gas within the Lodgepole was near 112 units before encountering a more carbonaceous stratum near the False Bakken where gas reached 360 units. <br/>The depths of Lodgepole and Bakken gamma ray markers were utilized for isopaching the Three Forks curve landing target. The calculations were based on landing the curve approximately 25’ into the Three Forks Formation at the target center. Three off-set wells, Holst l-33H, Holst 2-33MLH and J eriyote 4—32-5TFH were used for isopaching the curve landing target. Holst 1-33H was the primary off- <br/>set well since it was drilled on the same pad and landed the curve near the same azimuth. Only Jeriyote 4—32-5TFH drilled into the Three Forks so it was important as well. J eriyote 4 and other area Three Forks <br/>wells suggested the Three Forks target center was a consistent 112’ below the Middle Bakken. This 112’ was added to the Middle Bakken depths of the closest off-set wells which did not reach the Three Forks. This strategy was seen as the most reliable for estimating the ideal Three Forks target. Due to the curve landing near the strike of the formation, only 2’ of structural rise was expected. Anticipating this 2’ structural rise, gamma ray markers early in the curve suggested a target of 10,162’ TVD so the target was </p>

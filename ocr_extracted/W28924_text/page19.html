    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">estimated strike of the formation. This ﬂat dip was then expected to transition into a slight down dip. The decrease in formation dip was expected as the lateral turn was drilled and the wellbore moved away from the strike of the formation. <br/>After drilling out of the casing shoe slides were implemented to turn azimuth from about 34° to 180°. Formation angle of dip early in the lateral average 90.09°; however this angle of dip, as expected, gradually decreased to 89.85° with the completion of the lateral turn. This down dip was then expected to transition into an up-dip halfway through the lateral. Near 15,500’ MD the expected dip change was encountered. Coinciding with this dip change was several surges in formation gas which are possibly due to natural fractures. The up-dip slowly transitioned into a down dip near 19,000’ MD. The original bit was used throughout the lateral but it became difﬁcult to steer due to its increasing tendency to drop and deﬂect while rotating which was likely due to shoulder wear. Drilling near the target top was preferred due to its distinctive gamma and easier drilling. Drilling low in the target has shown to be difﬁcult in surrounding wells due to the higher concentration of hard streaks and indistinctive gamma. A thick warm gamma marker in the top half of the target window was distinctive and useful in determining stratigraphic position. Below the target center, gamma was relatively warm but generally more erratic. Cool gamma encountered at the end of the lateral confirmed a stratigraphic position near the target top. Using this as a reference point, the total formation drop over the extent of the lateral was 5' which gave the formation an average angle of dip of 89.97°. Slides were oﬁen implemented to counter the bit’s tendency to walk left in rotation. The slides kept the well path right of the proposed path for almost the entire lateral. Total depth for Howo 5-33-4TFH was reached on October 6, 2014 at 20,035' MD at the target top. <br/>Samples from the warm gamma facies were generally a light green gray color with higher amounts of silt and clay. The samples with higher amounts of sand and dolomite were found in the multiple cool gamma facies. The highest amounts of pyrite were found in the cool gamma facies at the target top and even slightly above it. The thick warm gamma stratum underlying this cool gamma was described as a green gray to blue green waxy shaly siltstone. Lower in the target window samples showed a more faint green gray color and the cuttings were often platy (high amounts of silt). Octahedral pyrite crystals were also more prevalent in the bottom half of the target window. On one occasion the wellbore moved below the target window and samples collected from there were generally described as pinkish tan silty sandstone with moderate amounts of crystalline dolomite. <br/>ROP was fairly consistent throughout the lateral while rotating but slides became slightly slower with increasing drag down hole. An agitator was added to the assembly at the start of the lateral. MWD quality was not signiﬁcantly affected by the agitator. The average ROP over the extent of the lateral was 99fph but oﬁen over 200fph while rotating. ROP regularly drilled slower in the well indurated cooler gamma facies which is likely due to their lower clay and silt content but higher dolomite and sand content. The original bit and motor were used throughout the lateral. There was a trip at 11,275’ MD to replace the MWD tool. <br/>Natural gas readings in the Three Forks Formation seemed to vary only slightly depending on stratigraphic position. Formation gas remained fairly steady throughout the lateral; however, it did steadily increase in the last 5,000’ MD with the highest readings just before reaching total depth. Any decrease in formation gas generally occurred in the argillaceous warm gamma strata while the highest readings were often in the more arenaceous cool gamma strata. The cool gamma facies appeared to be the best reservoir rock in the Three Forks due to its low clay content and higher quartz content. Even ﬂuorescence and milky cuts were also more frequent than in the higher gamma strata. The warm gamma facies had low permeability and were generally described as light green gray shaly siltstone. Formation gas averaged 300 units throughout the lateral with the highest reading of 2032 units at the target top near 20,000’ MD. Increases in gas also seemed to be present near suspected dip changes, which may be due to <br/>natural ﬁ'actures from deformation events. </p>

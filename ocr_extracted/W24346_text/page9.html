Waiting time: Hold the cement slurry in place and under pressure until it reaches its initial set without disturbing it. A cement slurry is a time-dependent liquid and must be allowed to undergo a hydration reaction to produce a competent cement sheath. A fresh cement slurry can be worked (thickening or pump time) as long as it is in a plastic state and before going through its transition phase. lfthe cement slurry is not allowed to transition without being disturbed. it may be subjected to changes in density. dilution. settling. water separation. and gas cutting that may lead to a lack of zonal isolation and possible bridging in the annulus. <br/>3. Pipe movement: Reciprocation and/or rotation mechanically breaks up gelled mud and changes the flow pattems in the annulus to improve displacement efﬁciency. <br/>4. Mud properties (for cementing): <br/>Rheology: <br/>Plastic Viscosity (PV) < 15 centipoise (cp) <br/>Yield Point (YP) < l0 lb/lOO it? These properties should be reviewed with the Mud Engineer, Drilling Engineer, and Company Representative(s) to ensure no hole problems are created. <br/>Gel Strength: The lO-second/ 10-minute gel strength values should be such that the lO—second and 10-minute readings are close together or ﬂat (i.e.. 5/6). The 30-minute reading should be less than 20 lb/lOO ftz. Sufﬁcient shear stress may not be achieved on a primary cement job to remove mud left in the hole if the mud were to develop more than 25 lb/lOO ﬂz ofgel strength. <br/>Fluid Loss: Decreasing the ﬁltrate loss into a permeable zone enhances the creation ofa thin. competent ﬁlter cake. A thin, competent ﬁlter cake created by a low ﬂuid loss mud system is desirable Over a thick. panially gelled ﬁlter cake. A mud system created with a low fluid loss will be more easily displaced. The ﬂuid loss value should be < 15 <br/>cc's (ideal would be 5 cc's). <br/>5. Circulation: Prior to cementing. circulate full hole volume twice. or until well conditioned mud is being returned to the surface. There should be no cutting in the mud returns. An annular velocity of260 feet per minute is optimum (SPE/IADC 18617). if possible. <br/>6. Flow rate: Turbulent flow is the most desirable ﬂow regime for mud removal. Ifturbulence cannot be achieved. pump at as high a ﬂow rate that can practically and safely be used to create the maximum flow energy. The highest mud removal is achieved when the maximum ﬂow energy is obtained. <br/>7. Pipe Centralization: A minimum standoffof7091» should be targeted for optimum displacement efﬁciency. <br/>8. Rat hole: A weighted viscous pill placed in the rat hole prior to cementing will minimize the risk of higher density cement mixing with lower density mud when the well is static. <br/>9. Top and Bottom plugs: A top and bottom pltrg is recommended to be run on all primary casingjobs. The bottom plug should be run after the spacer and ahead ofthe ﬁrst cement slurry. <br/>10. Spacers and ﬂushes: Spacers and/or flushes should be used to prevent contamination between the cement slurry and the drilling fluid. They are also used to clean the wellbore and aid with bonding. To determine the volume. either a minimum of 10 minutes of contact time or 1000ft. of annular ﬁll. whichever is greater. is recommended. m drillinnI operations using diesel-based drilling ﬂuids. we suggest Tuned Spacer III. This is a water—based spacer designed to eliminate the use ofdiesel thereby mitigating environmental impact and reducingjob cost. This spacer can be customized to the desired density and rheology (PV and YP) in order to better to remove mud and ﬁlter cake from the hole. This will result in the best zonal isolation by providing superior cement—to—casing and cement-toforrnation bonds. </p>

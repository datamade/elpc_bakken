The pick of the Middle Bakken was primarily done oﬂ‘ gamma correlation to the Stenehjem 41-3-3H curve gamma. The lithology of the Middle Bakken Formation was siltstone that was gray to light gray, tan gray, and dark gray that was ﬁne grained and with an even green yellow ﬂuorescence and thick cloudy cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 63 ﬁlm. Gas was an average of 425 units with a max of 673 units through the Middle Bakken Formation. </p>

According to the structure map, it was believed this well would average a 90.15 degree up dip — expecting formation to come up a total of approximately 20 feet throughout the lateral section. The Middle Bakken in this part of the Bully Field was expected to be 33 feet thick. A target window of 10 to 18 feet into the Middle Bakken Formation was set by Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation. A planned horizontal azimuth turn to the south was planned for this well. The lateral turn was started at 11,698 feet on February 8, 2015 at 3:50 PM CST with a starting azimuth of 141 degrees. The lateral turn was ﬁnished at 13,020 feet on February 9, 2015 at 10:15 AM CST with an azimuth of 180 degrees. Overall, formation trended up slightly throughout the well. In total, formation came up approximately 15 feet in total vertical depth. Mudloggers used B/C and CID facie contacts along with a clean gamma signature which was one to two feet above the bottom of the target window to correlate dip and determine structural position. </p>

The decision was made at 11,658 feet MD to TOOH for MWD failure on February 8, 2015 at 5: 15 AM CST. Drilling was resumed at 3:20 PM CST on February 8, 2015. The decision was made at 17,950 feet MD to TOOH for motor failure on Februaiy 11, 2015 at 1:30 AM CST. Drilling resumed at 6:30 PM CST on February 11, 2015. <br/>The lithology of the Middle Bakken Formation was siltstone that was relatively medium to dark in color. When the wellbore was above the 8 foot window, in the A facie, samples were relatively dark in color and were dominated with gray to dark gray colors. When drilling in the 8 foot window, in the C facies, samples changed to a light gray and tan gray. The time spent drilling below the target window, in the D facies, samples were dominantly brown to gray brown color and the siltstone was more platy to ﬂakey than the A and C facies.

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Lithology of the Lodgepole consisted of dark gray, gray, light gray, light brown, argillaceous, limestone. Petroleum shows of the Lodgepole were scattered and generally weak. Dull even ﬂuorescence and weak to instant cuts were observed. Gas shows of the Lodgepole were weak, ranging from 17—398 total gas units. <br/>False Bakken 10,924 MD 10, 793 ’ T VD -8, 684 ’ SS <br/>The False Bakken shale was identiﬁed by a signiﬁcant increase in gamma counts at measured depth 10,924 feet and true vertical depth of 10,793 feet, and was calculated to be two feet thick. Total gas readings of the False Bakken reached 421 total gas units. Petroleum shows were good, with no ﬂuorescence and instant bright cuts. <br/>Scallion 10,928’ MD 10, 795’ TVD -8, 686 ’ SS <br/>The Scallion was indicated by a lowering of the gamma counts and samples of poorly indurated gray limestone. Total gas readings of the Scallion peaked at 4269 total gas units. Petroleum shows remained moderate in the form of ﬂuorescence and cut. </p>

The Upper Bakken Shale was picked by an increase in gamma values into the 400-500 API range. The Upper Bakken exhibited black slightly calcareous, earthy shale. Strong hydrocarbon shows were exhibited by instant bright milky cuts. Total gas readings of the Upper Bakken rose to 3,573 total gas units. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,040’ MD 10,830’ TVD -8, 721 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was entered at a measured depth of 11,040 feet and true vertical depth of 10,830 feet The Middle Bakken was determined to be a light gray to <br/>tan, argillaceous, dolomitic, silty sandstone, with fair petroleum shows. Gas readings through the Middle Bakken were 73-1475 total gas units. </p>

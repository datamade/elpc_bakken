The course of the wellbore had a proposed overall azimuth of 17 5.79 degrees. This well is located east of Williston, North Dakota in SE SW Section 9 T154N R97W. The bottom hole coordinates of the P Vance 154-97—14-9-21—15HA are 284.64' FSL & 2,282.61' FEL, SW SE Section 21 T154N R97W. </p>

Wellsite geological services were started at 1:37 am CT on February 6‘“, 2015, at a measured depth of 9,200’ within the Charles formation. Ten foot, thirty foot, and ﬁﬁy foot lagged samples were caught by geologist/ mud loggers and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey in Grand Forks, North Dakota and Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation in Denver, Colorado. 9 5/8” surface casing was set at 2,475.0 feet measured/true vertical depth. An eight and three quarter inch wellbore was drilled to the end of the curve using invert. 7” intermediate casing was ran and set at 11,7650 feet measured depth. The lateral was drilled with a six inch bit using salt water based drilling ﬂuid. Gas monitoring equipment was provided by Neset Consulting Services, using a Total Gas system. <br/>Vertical Wellbore </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Geological logging began within the Charles Formation. Drill cuttings from the Charles indicated a mix of gray to brown limestone, soﬁ pasty, off white to light gray anhydrite and frosty, opaque, translucent salt. Alternating throughout the formation were beds of opaque and blocky salt, limestone, and anhydrite. The base of the last Charles Salt was picked using samples and rate of penetration data at 9,247 feet measured depth and 9,244 feet true vertical depth. Gas and petroleum shows in the Charles ranged from 17-252 total gas units. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,455 ’ MD 9,452 ’ TVD - 7,343 ’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was determined to begin at a measured depth of 9,455 feet and true vertical depth of 9,452 feet based on samples and rate of penetration data. Samples throughout the formation represented a large bed of limestone, ranging in colors of tan, brown, light brown, gray to light gray, and cream. Limestone samples were consistently mudstone, and argillaceous in part, with rare dolomite interspersed. Anhydrite was seen at the top of the formation. Poor porosity was observed throughout the formation. Fluorescence and cut were on average fair and gas shows were weak to moderate, with total gas readings showing 17-365 total gas units. </p>

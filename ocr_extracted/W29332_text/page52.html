It was also picked by gamma, as we washed down to verify top. Typical samples were a limestone consisting of a medium gray to light gray tan, cream gray in part, dark gray, dark tan in part, packstone to wackestone, microcrystalline, ﬁrm to hard, very calcareous, slightly <br/>argillaceous, poor intergranular porosity, dull greenish brown with spotted yellowish ﬂuorescence, with a slow weak cut. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Curve began on December 8th, 2014. KOP was at 10,875’ MD and 10,787’ TVD. This depth is 534 feet TVD into the Lodgepole formation. Drilling times ranged from 0.3 to 3.7 min/ﬂ and averaged 0.81 min/ﬂ. Gas averaged 258 units with values as high as 2,116 units. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the curve to correlate with the Wisness 150-100-23-14-7H and llTFH wells. <br/>Upper Bakken 11,210'MD 11,062' TVD -8,743'SS <br/>The top of the Upper Bakken was picked at 11,062’ TVD; -8,743’ SS from the samples changing from a medium gray limestone to a black to dark brown shale. Shale sample was black to dark brown, very carbonaceous, silty, and blocky. Samples had a very dark brown ﬂuorescence and an instant blooming milky cut. It was also picked by a drop in differential pressure and correlating gamma markings. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,238' MD 11,078’ TVD -8, 759' SS <br/>At 11,07 8’ TVD the Middle Bakken was encountered. This top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The Middle Bakken exhibited a Dolomite that was a light tan gray to beige, dark cream to light gray, tan to off white in part, silty in part, microcrystalline, sub-rounded to sub-angular, carbonaceous, argillaceous, calcareous, moderate induration, good to fair intercrystalline porosity, faint green with pinpoint yellow ﬂuorescence, with an rapid cloudy cut. <br/>Lower Bakken 11,298' MD 11,108’ TVD -8, 789'SS <br/>At 11,108’ TVD the Middle Bakken was encountered. This top was picked from lithology, gamma, and ROP changes. The Lower Bakken exhibited shale that was black, <br/>dark gray, dark brown, blocky, soﬁ to ﬁrm, brown to gray, silty, trace sucrosic, very carbonaceous, waxy, platy, very dark brown ﬂuorescence, with a thick cloudy cut. </p>

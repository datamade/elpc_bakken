    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">On October 23, 2014 SLB arrived with and the whip stock / mill assembly was tripped in the hole. Nearing the bottom of the hole the whip-stock was orientated to 10R. As the shoe was exited the BHA hung up and the sheer pin severed dropping the whipstock. Using weight, it was indicated that the whip stock was located at 9,522’ MD, however, there were not enough indications as to whether or not the whipstock had been fully set. <br/>Due to inconclusive data pertaining to the direction of the whipstock, and not knowing if it had set properly, the decision was made to trip out of the hole and pick up a mill bit in order to push the whipstock down hole. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Returning to bottom on October 24‘“, 2014 with the mill assembly attached the whipstock was reached at a measured depth of 9,522’ MD. Weight was placed on the whip stock to push it down, however, was unsuccessful. The whip stock was then milled on to conﬁrm placement. Placement was conﬁrmed with ultra-ﬁne steel cuttings (estimated to be mainly ﬁom mill, as the whipstock was a harder steel) as well as weight. <br/>Once on surface with the location of the whip stock known the decision was made to attempt to ﬁsh the whipstock. A hook tool was used instead of an overshot like tool, so in the event the whip stock was latched but could not be freed the whipstock could be <br/>released. The ﬁshing tool unsuccessﬁil in latching, however did conﬁrm placement at 9,522’ MD. <br/>With the whip stock located at 9,522’ MD and the Shoe located at 9,514’ MD, the <br/>decision was made to set a cement plug (see cement report). With eight feet between the whipstock and the shoe, the cement plug was placed in order to attempt a sidetrack above <br/>the whipstock. Once the cement was pumped 24 hours was allowed for curing. <br/>On October 26, 2014, time drilling was started using a Security QHBOR six inch bit combined with a 4.75 83 stage three degree motor. One-hundred percent cement was observed in samples from 9,450’ MD to 9,522’ MD. Samples were caught in 1 foot intervals to conﬁrm the success of the sidetrack at 9,522’ MD at which point samples <br/>began to contain a 5% dolomite. Samples continued to increase in the percentage of dolomite to reach 100% dolomite by 9,536’ MD. <br/>On October 28‘“, at 2:30 PM the side track assembly was TOOH at 9,565’ MD after conﬁrmation of a successﬁil sidetrack by samples as well as survey. <br/>Lateral 9,565 ’ 1WD- 19,547’MD <br/>The lateral section of the well was started using a six inch NOV DSSléM bit combined with a ﬁve inch, 6/7 stage, 1.83 degree, Hunting motor. The initial target was set from 9,800’ MD to 11,000’ MD between the TVD of 9325’ and 9,335’ respectively and extended to between 9,340’ and 9,350’ TVD. </p>

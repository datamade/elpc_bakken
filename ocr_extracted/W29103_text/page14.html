Gas at this time rose to 185 units from 61 units. Gamma conﬁrmed the False Bakken with a rise in API from 34 to a peak of 106 API. The False Bakken Measured twelve feet thick and was exited at 9,41 S’MD (9,282’ TVD) with an inclination of 64 degrees. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Scallion was noted at 9,415’ MD (TVD 9,282) as samples changed over to a tan gray to tan dolomitic limestone. Gamma recorded a drop from 109 API to a low of 29 API. The Scallion recorded a total thickness of ten feet and was exited at an inclination of 64 degrees. <br/>NOTE: Prior to entering the Upper Bakken shale a trip out of the hole was made due to a motor failure at a measured depth of 9,400’ MD. The build rates needed to complete the curve was 8 degrees per on—hundred. The TOOH occurred from 11:30 am on 10/20/14 and returned to bottom on 10/20/14 at 8:00 PM with a re—run of the Hughes T505 and a new Phoenix motor 675”, 7.8 lobe, HR stage. <br/>Upper Bakken 9,442’MD 9,292'TVD -7,269'SS <br/>Entering the Upper Bakken Shale at 67 degrees at 9,442” MD with a TVD of 9,292’ Gamma rose to peak of 342 API ﬁ‘om 33 API. Gas increased to 230 units. Samples in the Upper Bakken consisted of greasy black non calcareous brittle shale with oil shows consisting of even dull yellow brown ﬂuorescence and instant milky yellow brown cuts. Gas averaged 2230 units as the Upper Bakken was penetrated. An exit of the shale was made at 9,490’ MD with a TVD of 9,311’ at 68 degrees for a wellbore exposure of 48 feet and a total thickness of 18-20 feet. During the landing the Upper Bakken Shale came in roughly 2 feet high to the prognosis. Build rates prior to landing fell short with a 3 and 4 degree build rate consecutively. </p>

ROP was showed a reverse drilling break from .41 min/ﬂ to 1.4 min/ﬂ. Samples showed a gray to frosted brown siltstone with a light tan oil stain, pale yellow ﬂorescence and an instant blooming milky yellow green cut. </p>

At this time it was realized the initial drilling break correctly </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Parshall 403-3534H is located in Section 35 with a latitude and longitude of 47 degrees 56' 10.453“ N, 102 degrees, 9' 48.798" W. The legal location is 650' F SL, 1,950' FWL, Section 16, Township 152N, Range 90 W, Mountrail County, North Dakota. Drilling began on October 17, 2014 with surface casing set 2,140’ MD. The Parshall 4033534H was drilled with the intention of producing oil and gas from the Middle Bakken formation. <br/>The drilling rig, H&P 524, was used to perform drilling operations. Total Drilling was the company used for MWD, and Directional Drilling. Dustin Hease and Jacob Blake with Baker Hughes Fluid Control were the mud engineers on site. Neset Consulting Services arrived on October 18, 2014 with Sid Newstrom, Justin Peterson as onsite mud loggers. The M9 (NCS) was used to collect gas data alongside Pason as the rig interface (H&P used Totco for reporting purposes). <br/>Logging began on October 19, 2014 at 1:45 AM with samples taken in thirty foot intervals throughout the vertical section of the well beginning at 7,660’ MD. Ten foot samples were caught as needed to identify formation tops. All samples were washed, cataloged, and saved for archive at the North Dakota geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. </p>

The Ground elevation was 1,993’ MD with a sub of 30’ for a total KB of 2,023’ MD. Surface casing was set at 2,140’ MD using 9625” casing. Intermediate casing was set with two different weights <br/>of HTC <br/>P—l 10 7” casing. Twenty-six pound was set at 5,634, and 32# was set at 9514’MD. KOP was located at 8,831’ MD roughly 500 feet TVD from the target landing of 9,315’ TVD (9,519 MD). This allowed for a radius curve of twelve degrees per one hundred feet. On October 19, 2014, at 3:10 pm, a target landing of 9,519’ MD (TVD 9,320.97’) was reached with a projected inclination of 70 degrees. </p>

The base of the last salt showed a total thickness of twenty six feet as observed by sample and ROP changes. Gas just above the BLS was noted at 10 units and showed no change in gas. Samples through the last salt consisted mostly of a massive halite. The base of the last salt was noted roughly ten feet <br/>high to the prognosis. </p>

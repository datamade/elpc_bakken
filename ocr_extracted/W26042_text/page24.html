Hiland Partners' Watford City Super System is a broad network of low pressure and high pressure lines. Field gas is gathered and transported through the system to Hiland Partners’ Watford City Plant (Sec. 6-151N—102W) for processing. The system has interconnections to allow offloading excess gas volumes to Hess' Tioga plant (Sec. 26-157N-95W) and to OneOK’s Stateline plant (Sec. 21-155N-103W). <br/>2b., 2c. See attached plats. <br/>Gathering Segment Name: WC4-4 Bears Gathering System <br/>  <br/>3a. Maximum Current Capacity of Gathering Segment: 55.000 MCFD <br/>3b. Current Throughput of Gathering Segment: 32,000 MCFD <br/>3c. Anticipated Capacity of Gathering Segment At lP Date: 55 000 MCFD <br/>3d. Anticipated Throughput of Gathering Segment At lP Date: 54 000 MCFD {including these wellsl 3e. Issues or Expansion Plans: N/A <br/>Flowback Strategy <br/>4a. First production is expected 5/23/ 15, Gas sales connection is expected by 5/8/15 <br/>4b. Anticipated oil and gas rates: IP 1,096 BOPD, 1,881 MCFD <br/>Amount of Gas Applicant is Currently Flaring 5a. Statewide percentage of gas flared: 11.31% (5/2014) 5b. Fieldwide percentage of gas ﬂared: Camp, 6.5% (5/2014) <br/>Alternatives to Flaring <br/>6a. Purchaser capacity is expected to be sufficient for the volumes produced from these wells. In the event that electric power is required on—site, a natural gas powered generator will be evaluated. installation of a liquid stripping plant to be utilized in the event of upset conditions would not be economic. Such an installation will be revevaluated as additional wells are completed and if conditions change. <br/>6b. A natural gas powered generator could be expected to reduce ﬂare volumes by approximately 30-40 MCFD. A liquid stripping plant could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 40%. On lease gas use by Heater/Treaters will consume approximately 15 MCFD </p>

It is a single lateral horizontal well targeting the lower portion of the Middle Bakken siltstone as well as tan sandstone, drilled on a 2560—acre spacing unit. The well was spudded on September 15, 2014 and reached a total depth of 20,475‘ at 1:30 AM CDT on November 11, 2014. Dave Edwards and Chris Calame were onsite for well site supervision, along with Scott Strahm and Stephanie Connole representing Neset Consulting Service, Inc for wellsite geological services. <br/>Well site services began at the logging depth of 7,930’ MD, at 11:00 AM CDT, on September 20, 2014. Two man geological services were used for the vertical, curve and lateral. A Total Gas detector was utilized for gas analysis. Samples were caught every thirty feet throughout the vertical section and curve. Samples were caught every ﬁfty feet through the lateral. All samples caught were saved to be archived at the ND Core and Sample Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. </p>

The Mission Canyon came in 4’ high of the prognosis and drilled consistently with ROP between .28 and .97 min/ﬂ. Samples in the Mission Canyon were primarily blocky argillaceous limestone that was brown to gray brown with traces off white to light cream gray anhydrite and medium gray dolomite throughout.

The Lodgepole was encountered even to the prognosis, and picked off of differential pressure and torque, and conﬁrmed with a sudden increase in gamma. Gamma increased up from 21.4 API units to 45.53 API units to mark the top of the Lodgepole. Samples in the <br/>Lodgepole were mostly light to medium gray tan to gray brown limestone with minimal ﬂuorescence and dull weak to slow milky yellow cuts. </p>

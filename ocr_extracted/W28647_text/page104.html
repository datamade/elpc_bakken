    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The wellbore would begin dropping in and enter the target window at 10,880’ MD. This drop would continue and send the wellbore into the lower portion of the target window. 2 high side slides were put in at 10,950’ MD and 11,104’ lvﬂ). The wellbore would continue dropping and encounter the BIG marker at 11,081’ MD. This encounter would indicate a ﬂattening in the formation to 89.62 degrees. <br/>A 3rd high side slide was put in at 11,412’ MD to bring the wellbore back up in the formation. The wellbore would re-enter the clean “B” facies at 11,498’ lVﬂ). This encounter with the B/C contact would indicate ﬂattening in the formation to 90.0 degrees. A downslide was put in at 11,533 ’ MD to counter the rise seen in the wellbore. This slide would send the wellbore back down the rough the B/C marker at 11,728’ MD. The encounter with the marker would indicate a steepening in the formation to 8897 degrees. <br/>Drilling would continue below the BIG contact in the lower portion of the target window until a high side slide at 12,148’ MD would send the wellbore rising in the formation. This rise would send the wellbore back into the clean “B” facies at 12,445’ MD. This encounter would indicate a ﬂattening in the formation to 89.66 degrees. A downslide at 12,302’ MD would ﬂatten the wellbore out and send it back down in the formation. The wellbore would cross back in the “C” facies at 12,673’ MD. This <br/>encounter with the B/C contact would indicate a ﬂattening in the formation to 89.93 degrees. <br/>2 downslides were put in at 13,045’ MD to prevent the continued rise in the wellbore. Theses slides would send the wellbore dropping back down into the “C” facies at 13,199’ MD. This encounter with the B/C contact would indicate a ﬁmher ﬂattening in the formation to 89.83 degrees. Drilling would continue in the lower portion of the target window until a high side slide put in at 13,897 ’ MD would send the wellbore rising in the formation. The clean “B” facies was entered at 13,997’ MD. <br/>This encounter would indicate a ﬂattening in the formation to 89.6 degrees for this section. The rise in the wellbore would continue and send it into the upper portion of the target window. 3 downslides were put in starting at 14,003’ MI) would send the wellbore dropping gradually in the formation. The wellbore would exit through the base of the clean “B” facies at 14,572’ MD. This encounter would conﬁrm the projected dip rate of 89.43 degrees. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling would continue below the B/C contact until a rise in rotation would send the wellbore back into the clean “B” facies at 14,988’ MD. A downslide put in at 15,030’ MD would send the wellbore back down into the “C” facies at 15,137’ MD. The wellbore would re-enter the clean “B” facies at 15,27 5’ MD. This encounter would indicate a steepening in the formation to 89.14 degrees; The wellbore would continue dropping at this point through the base of the target window at 15,544’ MD. </p>

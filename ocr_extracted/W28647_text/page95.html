WEBB WHITING OIL AND GAS CORP <br/>1700 BROADWAY SUITE 2300 DENVER, CO 80290-2300 <br/>RE: HANSEN 44-28—2H SESE 28-153N-92W MOUNTRAIL COUNTY WELL FILE NO. 28647 <br/>Dear Scott: <br/>After review of the Cement Bond Log submitted on the above referenced well, dated November 20, 2014, we have determined that the top of cement behind the 7" casing string is at a depth of 5462 feet. The top of the CRETACEOUS-NEWCASTLE Formation within the Dakota Group is picked from logs at 4919 feet. The North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43—02-03-21 requires that sufficient cement be used to isolate the Dakota Group of which the CRETACEOUS-NEWCASTLE Formation is a part. In lieu of an <br/>immediate cement squeeze, approval may be granted (via Form 4 Sundry Notice) to monitor the surfaceproduction casing annulus. Approval will be contingent upon the following stipulations: <br/>l. The surface-production casing annulus must be continuously monitored with an accurate pressure gauge, the pressure gauge must not be any higher than a 300 psi gauge. <br/>2. All valves installed on the annulus must be exposed to the surface; burial will be allowed only in, the presence of an Oil and Gas Division inspector. <br/>3. Any pressure development on the annulus must be immediately reported to the Oil and Gas, Division <br/>4. The CRETACEOUS—NEWCASTLE Formation must be isolated, as directed by the Oil and Gas: Division, upon the abandonment of the well, remedial action may be required prior to <br/>abandonment if warranted by the Director. <br/>Since the Dakota Group is not properly isolated, WHITING OIL AND GAS CORP must run a frat: string prior to performing a Hydraulic Fracture Simulation per North Dakota Administrative Code <br/>Section 43-02-03-27.1 <br/>If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me. <br/>Sincerely, <br/>ichaﬁ <br/>Geologist rkg/ras <br/>600 E Boulevard Ave - Dept 405, Bismarck, North Dakota 58505-0840 Phone (701)328-8020 Fax (701)328-8022 <br/>‘th4‘r </p>

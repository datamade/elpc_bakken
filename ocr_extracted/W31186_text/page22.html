Once surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seat will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent foreign matter from getting into the Well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will mova onto the location within the sgdays previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this Request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Sect. 43-02-03-55 of NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but Is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well.

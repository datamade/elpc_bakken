    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">true vertical depth of 8,494’, ﬁve feet high to prognosis. The top of the Mission Canyon was picked off an increase in penetration rates as well as comparisons to the offsetting wells porosity benches throughout the Mission Canyon. Penetration rates throughout the majority of the Mission Canyon averaged around 150 ﬁ/hr with increases up to 180 ﬁlm seen throughout the porosity benches. The samples throughout the upper 100' of the formation exhibited primarily a gray tan/cream gray tan limestone with trace to moderate anhydrite present and occasional dolomite mixed in. The remainder of the formation exhibited primarily limestone with trace amounts of cream to off—white anhydrite present. Background gases throughout the Mission Canyon averaged around 11 units while waiting on a new gas machine to be brought out. <br/>Lodgepole 9,194’ MD 9,184’ T VD -6, 833 ’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,194’, true vertical depth of9, 184’, three feet low to prognosis. The Lodgepole formation was picked at the base of the lower Mission Canyon porosity as well as a sample change from a cream gray tan limestone to a cream gray/light to medium gray limestone. Gamma was logged across the top of the Lodgepole down to KOP. Gamma correlations up to this point continued to come in consistent with the Jones 11-8H and the Arndt 14—5TFX wells. Penetration rates throughout the formation down to KOP averaged around 120 150 ﬁ/hr with background gases averaging around 34 - 50 units. KOP was reached at 5:40 pm. CST on January] 1, 2015 at a measured depth of 9,457'. After picking up the curve assembly and TIH problems were experienced with tight hole issues. The decision was made aﬂer not being able to continue the TIH to lay down the curve assembly and pick up a 1.5 degree motor and a tricone bit and run that through the vertical section to ream any tight spots. The assembly was ran to bottom with minimal resistance and the TOOH was completed. The curve assembly was then picked up and ran in the hole. Starting around a MD of 4,000’ problems were experienced with the hole again and the decision was made to wash and ream the remainder of the drill pipe to bottom. <br/>Curve 9,457' — 10,310’ MD <br/>The curve for the North West lateral was started in the Lodgepole Formation at a measured depth of 9,457' at 9:35 am. CST on January 13, 2015. An 8 3/4” Security bit and 2.38 degree ﬁxed mud motor were used to build the curve. The landing target for the Jones #11-8—2XH at the beginning of the curve was set at 9,961” @ 90 deg. based off the Lodgepole top and the ﬁrst Lodgepole marker. The Jones #11-8H and the Arndt #145TFX were used for correlation purposes through the curve. Penetration rates at the beginning of the curve averaged around 80 - 100 ﬂ/hr while sliding. Background gases through the Lodgepole formation averaged around 17 — 50 units. The lithology of the Lodgepole exhibited primarily a cream gray tan/light to medium gray limestone with occasional anhydrite and shale present. Gamma markers continued to come in consistently but deeper than the Jones #11-8H and Arndt #14-5TFX wells with the TVD </p>

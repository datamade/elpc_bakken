    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">the upper portion of the Middle Bakken exhibited a cream gray/light gray siltstone with trace amounts of residual black shale sandstone, and limestone present. Background gases through the Middle Bakken averaged around 185 e 200 units. Drilling continued on with the curve through the Middle Bakken up to a MD of 10,310'. The curve was landed around 13 ’ into the Middle Bakken with 88 degrees projected to the bit. <br/>The curve for the North West lateral was landed at a measured depth of 11,310’ at 3 :00 pm. CST on January 14, 2014 with 88 degrees projected to the bit at a true vertical depth of 9,973’. Casing for the North West Lateral was set at 10,294’ MD. <br/>North West Lateral 10,311 ’ — 20,1 78' MD Dayl 10,311’—10,817’MD <br/>A Baker Hughes mud motor and Security bit were used for the North West Lateral. The T 1H began until tagging cement where the cement. Float & Shoe and ten feet of new formation were drilled to perform the FIT test. After ﬁnishing with the FIT test drilling resumed with the North West lateral with casing exited at a MD of l0,294’ at 5:20 pm. CST on January 27, 2015. Drilling began with the wellbore exiting casing at 8739 degrees dropping the wellbore into the lower portion of the Middle Bakken target interval. Directional began to the level the wellbore out and begin working on the planned directional turn. The wellbore began to build rapidly in TVD with an inclination as high as 93 degrees. At this time the formation had dropped from 89.49 degrees to 89.3 degrees placing the wellbore in the upper portion of the target window. At a MD of 10,817’ the WWD tool ﬂat lined and the decision was made to TOOH. TOOH and changed out the MWD tool and tripped back in the hole. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 150 — 200 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 70 — 80 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 200 — 400 units with connection gases reaching as high as 629 units. The samples seen in the upper portion of the target exhibited a cream tan/cream gray tan sandstone with an even yellow green ﬂuorescence and an instant streaming to milky yellow green cut. <br/>Day 2 10,81 7’ — 12,450’ MD <br/>After changing out the MWD tool and inspecting the Bit and Mud Motor the TlH began performing a shallow hole test on the MWD tool and ﬁlling pipe every 30 stands to bottom. Drilling resumed with the NW lateral with slides done for the planned directional turn as well as to work on dropping the wellbore in TVD into the lower portion of the Middle Bakken target interval. As the wellbore dropped in TVD the clean gamma from the C faces transition was seen and the wellbore continued to drop in TVD reaching about six feet below the base of the Middle Bakken target window. Slides were done and the wellbore began to slowly build in TVD towards the lower portion of the target window seeing the repeat of clean gamma about one to two feet below the base of the target interval indicating that the formation had ﬂattened slightly from 89.15 to 8935 degrees. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 250 — 280 ft/hr while rotating and around 70 — 80 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 500 — </p>

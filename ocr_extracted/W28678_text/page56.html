    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Geologic Summary <br/>The Bjella 4-13H was drilled as a single lateral horizontal well on a six well Eco-pad in Section 13 T159N R96W and ending in Section 24 T159N R96W in Williams County, North Dakota. The target formation was the Middle Bakken. The surface location was set at 360’ FNL & 1,290’ FWL of Section 13. Drilling began on September 7, 2014 and continued until a TD of 19,181’ was reached at 5:35 am CT on September 25, 2014 and had ending coordinates of 235.87’ FSL & 1,993.63’ FWL of Section 24 T159N R96W. <br/>Wellsite geological services consisted of two mudloggers. A Noram gas detecting system with chromatograph was utilized. Samples were caught at 30’ intervals from 7,250’ to end of the curve at 9,588’ MD and 100’ intervals throughout the lateral section to a TD of 19,181 ’ MD. All samples were saved and boxed to be sent to the State of North Dakota. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Charles formation was picked off sample and drilling change. The Charles formation was salt, translucent, white, milky white, hard, brittle in part, massive, with intermittent stringers of anhydrite, white, light gray, amorphous, soﬁ. At approximately 7,523’ samples changed to limestone, light brown, tan, yellow brown, cream, crypto to microcrystalline, fossiliferous at times, moderately calcareous, slightly argillaceous, ﬁrm to slightly soft, dolomitic in part, with frequent beds of salt observed. After the Base Last at 7,829’ MD, 7,828’ TVD (5,503’ SS) samples returned to limestone, brown, dark brown, gray brown, crypto to microcrystalline, fossiliferous at times, very to moderately calcareous, argillaceous at times, ﬁrm to slightly soft, very dolomitic at times. Intervals of very poor intergranular porosity were observed and very slow streaming ﬂuorescing cuts at times. Gas ranged from 22 to 382 units. The top of the Charles came in 3’ low to prognosis while the Base Last Salt came in 2’ low. <br/>Mission Canyon 8,048’ MD 8,04 7’ T VD -5, 722’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Mission Canyon formation was picked off sample and drilling change and was limestone, dark brown, brown, minor light brown, microcrystalline, calcitic at times, moderately calcareous, moderately argillaceous, silty, ﬁrm to slightly hard, dolomitic at times, with intervals of poor intergranular porosity observed and very slow to fast streaming ﬂuorescing cuts at times. Gas ranged from 40 to 271 units. The Mission Canyon came in 3’ low to prognosis. <br/>Lodgepole 8, 718’ MD 8, 717’ T VD -6,392’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole formation was picked off sample and drilling change. Samples were limestone, brown, light brown, gray brown, cream, tan, crypto to microcrystalline, scattered clear to milky calcite, moderate to very calcareous, moderately silty, argillaceous, ﬁrm to hard, dolomitic at times, earthy to chalky, with intervals of poor intergranular porosity observed and moderate to fast yellow white ﬂuorescing cuts at times. Gas ranged from 15 to 259 units. At 8,850’ MD KOP was reached and a trip was made to pick up curve assembly and begin drilling the curve. There was no gas seen from this trip. The Lodgepole came in 6’ low to prognosis. </p>

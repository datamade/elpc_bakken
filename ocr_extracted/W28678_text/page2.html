    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 9,403 ’ MD 9,261 ’ T VD ~6, 93 6’ SS <br/>The Bakken Shale was picked from gamma change. Samples were shale, black, noncalcareous, carbonaceous, pyritic, smooth, ﬁssile in part, blocky to sub-blocky, no porosity, abundant dull green ﬂuorescence, immediate bright milky yellow cut. Gas increased to 423 units. The Upper Bakken shale came in with prognosis. <br/>Middle Bakken Member 9,443 ’ MD 9,2 72’ T VD -6,94 7’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken Member was picked from gamma change. Samples were dolomite, light gray brown, light brown, tan, minor cream, microcrystalline, rarely pyritic, moderately silty, moderately calcareous, slightly argillaceous, earthy, microsucrosic in part, poor intercrystalline porosity, rare spotty dark brown oil stain, scattered dull yellow green ﬂuorescence, with an immediate bright milky white to yellow cut. Gas ranged from 40 to 102 units with connection gas to 90 units. The Middle Bakken Member came in 1’ high to prognosis. <br/>The curve was drilled to a TD of 9,588’ MD at 8:35 pm CT on September 12, 2014. Landing was 15’ into the Middle Bakken, approximately 5’ into the planned target zone. Casing was set at 9,574’ MD and had a BHL of 806.41’ FNL & 1,554.60’ FWL in Section 13, T159N, and R96W. <br/>Lateral #1 9,5 74 ’ MD — 12, 000’ MD <br/>Casing was exited on September 16, 2014 at 10:40 pm CT. Casing was set approximately 15’ into the Middle Bakken, at the top of the target zone. The planned target was a 20’ window with two clean gamma streaks separated by a hot marker based on what was seen on the Bjella 3—13H1. As the bit came out of casing the clean gamma was seen. A down dip was expected and the bit was brought down through zone while watching for the hot gamma marker. At approximately 10,025’ MD a gamma heat up was seen, indicating the absence of the hot marker and a ﬂat dip rate. The bit was leveled off and remained in the hotter gamma just below the clean. At the 11,000’ MD target the gamma showed a slight change and scrape below the target zone for a brief period. The 12,000’ MD target was adjusted up, to come back to the clean gamma and verify dip. The bit was brought up and encountered the clean gamma at 11,800’ MD. As the bit came up it was found that the second clean gamma streak at the top of target <br/>zone was no longer present and the bit came to the end of this section in this hotter gamma at the top of the target zone. <br/>This section showed low gas and no oil shows while drilling. Refer to chart below to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. </p>

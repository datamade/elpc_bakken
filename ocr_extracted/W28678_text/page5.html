    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The beginning of this section showed the bit in the middle of the clean gamma in the middle of target zone. At this point it appeared the dip was starting to ﬂatten out and a dip below the clean gamma from 16,300’ to 16,770’ MD veriﬁed this. After coming back in to the clean gamma the bit dropped slightly and went just below the clean gamma at 17,150’ MD. The bit leveled off and was thought to be following dip until a gamma change at approximately 17,440’ MD was seen. At 17,489’ MD a trip was made due to slow ROP. Aﬁer tripping and replacing BHA drilling resumed, maintaining a ﬂat trend. The gamma changes seen from 17,500’ to 18,600’ MD closely resembled the signature seen while drilling through the Middle Bakken on the Bjella 3-13H1, indicating an up dip was occurring. In addition to the gamma signature, the Bjella l-24 had shown a structural change at the point we were at and had seen a very hard up dip on what shown as a hill top on the structure map. Drilling continued with the bit being brought up until seeing a gamma change at approximately 18,700’ MD indicated that we had encountered the upper shale once again. Drilling was halted at 18,750’ MD and the decision was made to pull back and sidetrack from 17,890’ MD. BHL of sidetrack l was 667.27’ FSL & 1,997.83’ FWL in Section 24, T159N, and R96W. <br/>This section showed a decrease in gas and oil shows. The previous section showed a streak at the base of the clean gamma that produced the best gas and oil shows and this section showed more variance in position in target zone. The trip at 17,489’ MD showed trip gas that maxed out the gas detector at 10,000 units. Pressure was high and circulation of trip gas was done through the choke. There was 100% coverage of green oil and a 20’+ ﬂare was seen. <br/>Refer to chart below to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. </p>

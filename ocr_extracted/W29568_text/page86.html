    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">GAMMA <br/>The 10' target zone in the lateral was centered on a line 10’ below the top of the Middle Bakken but was changed to an 8’ zone as Middle Bakken appeared to thin out at MD 15,000’. The hot gamma marker (#3) was located at the top of the 10' zone based on the TVD Gamma signature of the Java 24-3OH but was centered in the target zone based on the TVD Gamma signature of the Golden 24-30H well. Both TVD Gamma signatures were referenced as the lateral depth increased. The ﬁrst 4—5,000’ of the lateral more closely mimicked the Java TVD GR signature but as the well deepened the gamma readings aligned more closely with the Golden TVD GR signature. At MD 16,000’, exceptionally high gamma readings were encountered with the well bore tracking in the target zone. These readings proved to be accurate as this depth was re-logged to validate the accuracy of the MWD gamma tool. No shale was observed in the formation samples (taken at a 30’ interval) during these abnormally high gamma readings. </p>

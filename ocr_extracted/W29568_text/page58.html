    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Spotted Hawk Development LLC Wiley 24-30H was the third well (Simba, Java, Wiley) drilled on a single pad located in S30 150N 90W. The Wiley 24-30H was drilled as a single three (3) mile horizontal lateral with the primary objective being in the Middle Bakken formation. Target depth for the lateral was 10’ into the Middle Bakken dolostone. This well is located on SESW Section 30-T150N-R90W in McLean County, North Dakota. The Wiley 24-30H spudded on October 23, 2014 and reached a total depth of 26,575’ MD on December 22, 2014. This well was drilled using an invert based mud system for the vertical and curve before switching to saltwater for the lateral. Trevor and Katie Meyers of Neset Consulting Service, Inc provided well site mud logging in the vertical, curve and the initial 4,000’ of the lateral. Dan Grifﬁn and Lynda Grifﬁn of Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided well site mud logging services beginning in the curve and through total depth in the Middle Bakken target zone. Thirty foot (30’) lagged samples were caught, examined and logged throughout the vertical and curve with one hundred foot (100’) samples in the lateral. Samples will be sent to Spotted Hawk Development LLC and North Dakota Core Library. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The prognosis for the Wiley 24-30H proved to be very consistently low to the actual tops encountered through the vertical well bore. The Charles Salt came in 14' low to the prognosis and the Base of the Last Salt came in 24’ low. The Mission Canyon came in 22' low, the Lodgepole 19' low, and the top of the Upper Bakken Shale came in 12’ low to the prognosis. The TVD target for the Middle Bakken landing was moved down 10’ to TVD 9,787’, 10’ lower than the prognosis. Casing was set at MD 11,195’. <br/>An NCS M9 Gas unit was utilized for monitoring total gas in the vertical and curve. An NCS Total Gas unit was used in the lateral. Scientiﬁc Drilling was used for MWD. The Company Man handled directional drilling responsibilities. <br/>Logging began at MD 7500' as drilling out of surface casing commenced at 823pm on October 28, 2014. Formation samples were taken at 30' intervals starting at MD 7500' through the landing of the curve in the Middle Bakken. 100' samples were taken across the entire lateral. </p>

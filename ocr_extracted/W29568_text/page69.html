The Charles Salt came in at 7749’ TVD. Background gas was 8 units and ROP averaged .47 minutes a foot. A typical sample was; SALT: Clear, translucent, hard; limestone, dark gray, tan in part, microcrystalline; shale, reddish brown, brick red, trace anhydrite, bright mineral ﬂuorescence, faint cloudy cut. <br/>Base of Last Salt 8,200’ MD 8,198’ TVD —6,149’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was picked off of gamma, WOB and ROP at 8198’ <br/>TVD. ROP averaged .34 minutes a foot in the salts. Gas averaged 7 units. A typical sample was; SALT: Clear, translucent, blocky, hard, no ﬂuorescence, no cut. <br/>Mission Canyon 8,378’ MD 8,376’ TVD -6,327’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon pick was made using gamma oﬂ‘ the mud log. It came in at 8376’ TVD. Background gas was 20 units, ROP average was .49 minutes a foot. A <br/>typical sample was; LIMESTONE: Dark brown, light brown, mottled in part, microcrystalline, argillaceous, moderately to well indurated; trace to none intercrystalline <br/>porosity, faint greenish gray ﬂuorescence, slow blooming cloudy cut. </p>

This pick was made off gamma. ROP averaged 1.0 min/ﬂ and background gas was 22 units. Typical sample for this formation: LIMESTONE: Medium to dark gray overall, light gray in part, trace cream, microcrystalline, argillaceous in part, moderate induration, rare dead oil staining; fair intercrystalline porosity; scattered faint yellow/green ﬂuorescence, no cut. <br/>Upper Bakken 9,956’ MD 9, 760’ T VD -7, 711 ’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was picked from ROP, gamma and lithology change. ROP averaged 082 minutes a foot with background gas averaging 235 units with a high of 303 units. Gamma readings reached 520 API. A sample from this section; SHALE: Black, blocky, calcareous, trace disseminated pyrite, carbonaceous in part, poorly to moderately indurated, even light green/yellow patchy ﬂuorescence, instant bright streaming cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 1 0,014 ’ MD 9, 777’ TVD - 7, 728’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken pick was made oﬂ‘ gamma and lithology change. ROP averaged 1.06 minutes a foot with background gas of 287 units. A typical sample was; ARENACEOUS DOLOMITE: Light to medium gray, microcrystalline, very silty, calcareous in part, trace pyrite, moderately indurated, faint petroliferous odor, grayish green pinpoint ﬂuorescence, slow cloudy cut. </p>

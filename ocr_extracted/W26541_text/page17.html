Each well will be flowed through flowback test units for 3—7 days per well for wellbore clean up, then turned to permanent production facilities. Two flow back test units will be used on the set of 4 wells. Gas will be sold from the flow back test units with the aid of gas coolers. Individual well IP rates should average .5 MMCFPD per well for 3-7 days, and .3 MMCFPD average for lst Month. Maximum total pad gas production 1.5 MMCFPD, and 1.2 MMCFPD average for 1st Month. <br/>Gathering Information Gas Gatherer: Address: 100 W.

Flaring will be reduced, when required, by utilizing NGL recovery units, natural gas generators, and to run other equipment. Gas coolers are also utilized to cool the temperature of the initial gas production that is above the temperature of the pipeline specification, so it can be sold. Currently, Kodiak Oil and Gas has NGL recovery in place and operating on 28 Wells (7 Pads) where pipeline has been delayed due to ROW issues. In addition, Kodiak has contracted 2 drilling rigs in Q3 2014 that can run on dry natural gas that is a product of the NGL recovery effort. Additional measures to limit flaring will include scheduling wellwork and initial production testing to limit peak gas production. <br/>‘ I=UIII <br/>    <br/>    </p>

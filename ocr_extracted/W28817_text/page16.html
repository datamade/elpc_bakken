Mud Program <br/>  <br/>a. The proposed circulating mediums to be employed in drilling are as follows: <br/>0’-2,250’ 8.4—9.2 28—36 <br/>2,250’ » 11,245’ Oil Based Mud 9 6 — 16 — 24 10 2 <br/>11,139’ — Brine 9.4 — 40 - 55 20.832’ 10.5 <br/>Sufﬁcient mud materials to maintain mud properties, control lost circulation, and contain <br/>“kicks” will be available at the wellsite. An example “General” mud program is attached to this application for reference. <br/>         <br/>4. Evaluation Program <br/>The anticipated type and amount of testing, logging, and corng are as follows: <br/>Cores None antici ated; Testin No drill stem tests are antici ated <br/>Cuttins samles will be collected eve 30’ to 50’; To of Charles to TD. <br/>MWD as needed to land wellbore; 100’ sample interval in the vertical portion of the <br/>wellbore, 45’ sample interval through the curve section, and 90’ samples throughout The logging program will consist of the following: <br/>the lateral. Survey interval may be decreased as needed to steer wellbore but will not be increased above the len hs listed above _31§_ <br/>The anticipated completion program is as follows: <br/>           <br/>  <br/>  <br/>         <br/>               <br/>- After drilling the Bakken lateral, a 4-1/ ” production liner with multiple packers will be run from above KOP, inside the 7” intermediate casing, out to TD of the lateral. Lateral stimulation will consist of multiple frac stages, consisting of a slick water or hybrid system with proppant. All frac stages will be pumped down a “tie-back” string of 4-1/2” casing of similar or stronger weight and grade to that of the liner. The tie back string will be run from surface to the top of the production liner and will provide pressure isolation during fracture stimulation. <br/>5. Abnormal Pressures and HZS Gas <br/>No abnormal pressures or temperatures or other hazards are anticipated. HZS gas is not expected to be encountered in this wellbore, but precautions will be taken to monitor for the presence of H28 while drilling. <br/>     </p>

From the shoe to 12,000’ MD dip was held at 89.85 degrees while dip calculations were made based off gamma markers in the Middle Bakken formation. Around 11,555’ MD slides were preformed to work the bit up in formation after gamma showed indications of bit close to the Lower Bakken Shale. The bit was worked back up to the Cool gamma marker before leveling it out. At 12,000’ MD Dip was changed to 90.40 degrees while bit tracked between the Lower half of formation to the Cool gamma marker for the next 1,000’ MD At 12,850’ MD Dip was changed to 90.16 degrees while bit tracked from the Lower half of formation to the Upper half for the next 2,000’ MD. At 14,384’ MD the dip was changed to 90.35 degrees for the next 700’ of MD aﬂer the bit tracked below the Ratty gamma marker in the Middle Bakken. Slides were put in to bring the wellbore up in formation and the lower Bakken Shale was struck at 15,154’ MD the dip was changed to 90.64 aﬁer encountering the Lower Bakken Shale. It was then decided to TOOH and put a whip stock in at 14,942’ MD and sidetrack due to the Shale strike. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Lateral Sidetrack #1 14,942’ MD — 20,809’ MD <br/>After the Whipstock was placed drilling of the sidetrack began on November 15, 2014 at 6:00am. Slides were put in to move the wellbore up in formation to the Ratty gamma marker. The ratty gamma marker was encountered at 15,188’ MD and the formation dip was recalculated to 9055 degrees inclination. The wellbore stayed between the ratty and clean gamma marker for the next 1000’ MD with formation dip being recalculated to 90.36 degrees. The wellbore went above the clean marker at about 16,200’ MD and tracked above there for about 500’ MD when it took a deﬂection off of the clean marker. Slides were put in after it was apparent the wellbore was heading for the shale and the formation had begun to drop off. The Upper Bakken Shale was scraped at 16,795’ MD and 10,870’ TVD. A TOOH was needed 16,875' MD to change out BHA on due to MWD failure November 16 2014 at 4:00 PM MST. Drilling resumed at 7: 10AM with a maximum trip gas of 4,336 units. After the scrape the slides brought the well bore back down in formation and the clean gamma marker was encountered again at 17,430’ MD and formation projection was recalculated to 89.80 degrees inclination. The formation continued at a down dip until the wellbore went below the ratty gamma marker at about 17,700’ MD when the formation projection was recalculated to 90.14 degrees inclination. The wellbore began to track under the ratty gamma marker in the stair step gamma for the next 1,200 when the ratty gamma marker was encountered again. The well bore moved below the ratty gamma marker and tracked in the stair step gamma for another 1,500’ MD for another 1000’ MD when the ratty marker was tagged at 20,200’ MD and the formation dip was recalculated to 90.24 inclination. The wellbore remained below the ratty gamma marker for the remainder of the wellbore. The Simpson 151~1025-8-1H Lateral reached a total depth of 20,809’ MD on November 19, 2014 at 12:45 PM MST. Drilling rates in the Middle Bakken formation ranged from 0.12-31.98 minutes per <br/>foot with an average of 0.45 minutes per foot. The bottom hole location was projected at MD 20809/INC 89.30/AZ 178.50/TVD 10886.54/VS 10143.53 </p>

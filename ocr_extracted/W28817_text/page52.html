The Simpson 151-102-5-8-1H was spudded on September 3, 2014 with surface drilled and cased to be resumed at a later date. Patterson 320 spudded the Simpson 151-102-5-8-1H on September 3, 2014 and reached a total depth of 20,809’ MD on November 19, 2014. Wellsite geological services began at 9,200 on November 6, 2014 at 5:07 AM MST. The initial phase of the Simpson 151-102-5-81H is a vertical and curve landing in the Middle Bakken Formation. The single lateral well targeting the Middle Bakken Formation approximately 11’-15’ below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale was started on November 11,, 2014. Thirty-foot samples were collected throughout the vertical and curve with ﬁfty—foot samples collected in the lateral. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 9,200’ —- 1 0,5 70 ’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 9,200’ MD in the lower Charles/Madison formation on November 6, 2014 at 5:07 AM MST. Gas detection system was tested before logging depth with system functioning correctly. Drill rates before encountering the Kibbey Lime formation ranged from 0.09-2.2 minutes per foot and averaging 0.94 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 11-45 units averaging 17 units. A typical sample was: LIMESTONE: Light gray, gray, dark gray, brown, tan, cream, white, cryptFaystalline, argillaceous, carbonaceous, moderate to well induration, dolomitic, poor inter-granular porosity, anhydn'te, yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming milky cut. <br/>Base of Last Salt 9,392’ MD 9,354 ’ T VD -7,032’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Base of the Last Salt was picked 3 feet lower than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and differential pressure. Drill rates below the Base of the Last Salt ranged from 0.37—4.33 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 0.80 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 11—1 12 units averaging 36 units. A typical sample was: LIMESTONE: Gray, light gray, dark gray, brown, tan, cream, white, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, carbonaceous, moderate to well induration, dolomitic, poor inter-granular porosity, anhydrite, yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming milky cut. <br/>Mission Canyon 9, 630’ MD 9,583’ TVD -7,261’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was picked 1 foot lower than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and diﬁ‘erential pressure. Drill rates in the Mission Canyon formation ranged from 0.17—3.97 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 0.69 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 11-174 units averaging 36 units. A typical sample was: LIMESTONE: Light gray, gray, dark gray, brown, tan, cream, crypto-crystalline, </p>

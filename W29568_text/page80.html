Drilling the curve commenced at 1230am. The curve was drilled with an 8 3/4” Security PDC bit and 2.38 degree motor. The initial TVD landing target was set at and remained at 9,777‘ per the prognosis. Correlations were made with the Simba 24-3 0H well located on the same pad. The curve was landed in the Middle Bakken at MD 10,695' and TVD 9,784' at 230pm on November 2, 2014. Drilling continued beyond the curve landing to MD 11,210’ to extend casing point beyond the hardline located in S25-T150N-R91W. <br/>Penetration rates throughout the curve were in the 0.50 to 1.50 min/ft range. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling horizontally in the Middle Bakken 10’ target zone commenced at 400pm on December 6, 2014. The well bore initially tracked through the 10’ target zone but reentered from below at MD 11,800’. At MD 12,250’, the target zone was moved down 5’ based on gamma readings that indicated the well bore was tracking above the desired target depth. A Lower Bakken Shale strike occurred at MD 15,882’ (see Well Tracker cross section below). A sidetrack point was established at MD 14,975’ on December 8, 2014. Drilling horizontally resumed at 530am on December 9, 2014. Total gas and oil shows increased signiﬁcantly as the well bore increased in measured depth. Total gas readings reached the 7,000 unit range producing a 5-10’ ﬂare. Trip gas ﬂares reached 2530’. Casing pressure was set at 1,000 psi to hold back the gas and oil during drilling operations. A light to medium olive green oil came over the shakers for most of the lateral with over 1200 barrels captured in one of the upright tanks. Formation dip averaged 89.33 degrees across the entire lateral but localized dip varied signiﬁcantly from 89.7 degrees to 88.7 degrees. </p>

<div style="position: absolute; margin-left: 329px; margin-top: 438px;">
    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">I, Ben White, Production Manager, for and on behalf of Cornerstone Natural Resources LLC, 1050 17th Street, Suite 1600, Denver, CO 80265, do certify and declare that the following information required for a gas capture plan is correct to the best of my knowledge: <br/>Cornerstone plans to drill and complete the Jepsen B 1807-6190 in Q3 2014. This well has been discussed with Oneok, the gas gathering company, for the area. A map is attached showing Cornerstone’s most recent version of maps received from Oneok with the well spotted and the anticipated pipeline route drawn in. The anticipated completion/first production date for this well is November 1, 2014 with an IP of approximately 400 MCFD and 450 BOPD and declining from there until it reaches its economic limit around approximately 40 years later. We anticipate that the gas line will be connected to Oneok in October 2014. This gas will be tied in with an anticipated 4” or 6” gas line to connect to Oneok’s main gathering lines to be compressed and processed at Oneok’s Lignite Plant located in section 12 of 162N—91W. The Lignite Plant has a capacity of 10 MMCFD with a current throughput of 5 MMCFD. At the time of 1St production, the Lignite Plant capacity is expected to be 10 MMCFD and will have an approximate throughput of less than 8 MMCFD. With limited drilling in the area, capacities of the lines and of the Lignite Plant are more than adequate for handling this well’s production. The current throughput of the Oneok gas line that Cornerstone will be connecting to is approximately 800 MCFD. The anticipated gas throughput including this well’s production is 1200 MCFD which is below the capacity of the 6” line and larger trunk lines downstream of the tie in. <br/>Cornerstone has all but 2 small wells tied into a gathering system. Other than isolated cases of freezes, downtime at compressor stations, etc. Cornerstone’s field’s flare percentage and statewide percentage is much less than 1% and well below the industry target of 26%. Since there is a gathering system surrounding this well, there are no alternatives needing considered <br/>to flaring as Cornerstone expects to tie this well into sales at first production as they have done <br/>on other wells in the area.

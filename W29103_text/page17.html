    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The ﬁrst section of the lateral portion of the well consisted of a 52 degree turn to an azimuth of 324 degrees ﬁom an azimuth of 272 degrees. The turned occurred from 10,000’ MD to 11,845’ MD. During this time surveys were taken in 30 foot intervals as per state requirements. <br/>Over the course of the ﬁrst section of the lateral the Upper gamma marker was observed multiple times. Using the Upper Marker observed at 9,915’ MD and 10,809’ MD the formation dip was calculated at 89.34 degrees which was in line with the dip prognosis. Samples taken above the Upper Gamma Marker consisted of a tan to light gray, sub rounded, argillaceous dolomite with even yellow ﬂuorescence and instant bright green white blooming to streaming cuts. Gas above the Upper Gamma Marker averaged more than 2,000 units with a notably high percentage of C3 and C4 gases, (a mossy green oil became apparent over shakers by 10,300’ MD), and reached a peak of more than 4,000 units on connection while going thru the gas buster. <br/>Gamma above the Upper Gamma Marker ranged from 60 API directly above the upper marker, to near 150 API as the Upper Bakken Shale was approached at 10,438’ MD (TVD 9,325). Reaching 10,809’ MD at a TVD of 9,339.6’ TVD, the wellbore passed through the upper gamma marker as the recorded gamma reached a peak of 150 API. Samples through the Upper gamma marker consisted of a cream to ﬁosted gray argillaceous dolomite with thin to thick dark laminations. (Oil was apparent over shakers and in samples.) <br/>As the wellbore reached 11,000’ Nﬂ) the target window was extended to 12,000’ MD between 9,349’ TVD and 9,3 59’ TVD respectively. Drilling ahead, the upper gamma marker was observed at 11,198’ MD (TVD 9,341.5’) just above the target window. A correctional slide was put in between 11,257” MD and 11,286’ MD (tool face of 150R). However, the slide only yielded a difference of one degree allowing the wellbore to climb to a peak of 9,334’ TVD at 11,371’ MD. During this time Gamma heated up to 267 API indicating the Upper Bakken Shale. Samples however, showed no shale in samples conﬁrming a near miss of the Upper Bakken Shale. Correctional slides were put in place and effectively brought the wellbore down in TVD to 9,345’ at a measured depth of 11,566’. At this point the Upper Gamma Marker was observed showing a ﬂattening of dip. As the wellbore reached 11,854’ MD (TVD of 9,345.91’) a local dip of 8988 <br/>degrees was calculated based upper gamma marker points of 11,566’ MD and 11,854’ MD. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Waypoint 3 extended out 14,000’ MD between 9,354’ TVD and 9,364’ TVD as structure maps suggested a slight down dip in well. Waypoint three was disregarded at a measured depth of 12,663’ MD (TVD 9,364’) when the lower Bakken shale was struck. Samples conﬁrmed a Lower Bakken Shale strike with a deep black brown pyritic shale. Corrective slides were made and the Lower Bakken Shale was exited at 12, 736’ MD for an estimated shale exposure of 77 ’ MD. <br/>Upon review of the Lower Bakken Strike it is believed that the TVD of the Lower Bakken shale was wrongly estimated during the curve portion of the well, as no surveys </p>

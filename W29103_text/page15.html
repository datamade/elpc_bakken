    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">showed the Middle Bakken top at a TVD near 9311’ TVD. This placed the wellbore roughly 9 feet into the Middle Bakken instead of 1 foot. Gamma conﬁrmed the Middle Bakken top at 9,312’ TVD roughly ﬁve feet higher than prognosis. <br/>Through the Middle Bakken a cream to translucent, sucrosic, micro-crystalline dolomite was observed with a medium to dark gray laminated siltstone was observed in the lower portion of the Middle Bakken. Gamma through the Middle Bakken averaged 75 <br/>API and continued to have positive oil shows throughout. <br/>On October 20, 2014 at 11:49 PM the end of the curve was reached at 9,519’ MD (TVD 9,320) at a projected 70 degrees. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Casing occurred from the 21"d of October to the 22‘” of October at which time tanks were changed over to salt water and 7” casing was placed in two sections. The ﬁrst was HCP -110 LTC 26# 7” casing set at 5,634’MD, followed by HCP —1 10 LTC 32# 7” casing set at 9,515’. See cement report. <br/>The Curve <br/>Once the 7” casing was completed a 6” Security tri-cone bit was attached to a 5”, 6/7lobe, 8 stage Alliance motor with a 2.42 degree bend. Based on a Lower Bakken shale projected top of 9,341’ TVD, the build rate needed to achieve a position of 9,334’ TVD at 90 degrees was 25degrees per 100 feet. On October 22, 2014 at 4: 15 PM the bottom of the wellbore was reached. Prior to reaching the bottom, pumps were turned on to record gamma at 9,400’ MD in order to conﬁrm the Middle Bakken top at 9,311’ TVD. Once conﬁrmed the shoe was drilled out to resume building the wellbore to 90 degrees. <br/>A survey was taken at 9,525’ MD (this was as soon as a survey could be taken without interference of easing). At this time the inclination of the survey was 64.4 degrees at a TVD of 9,323.53’. In light of the survey it was determined a tool error occurred causing the tool face to be off 180 degrees, essentially translating that while sliding at a tool face of 0 we were in fact sliding at a tool face of 180 degrees. Build rates calculated showed a build rate of 25 degrees per one-hundred feet straight down. The wellbore was drilled ahead to 9,590’ (20 feet) taking surveys every ﬁve feet to conﬁrm. While drilling ahead the Lower Bakken shale was struck at a measured depth of 9,580’ MD (projected TVD of 9,3 50’ at 50 degrees) and helped to conﬁrm the error. It was noted at the time that due to the tool error the TVD may not be accurate as the projected build rates could only be estimated and not conﬁrmed. Bottoms up conﬁrmed the shale at 9,580’ MD with samples consisting of a black brown pyritic non-calcareous ﬁrm shale. <br/>Following the Lower Shale strike the decision was made to set an open-hole whipstock at 9,525’ MD. This would allow for a kick-oﬂ‘ in the Middle Bakken at a TVD of 9,323’ needing a build rate of 25 degrees per one-hundred feet or less in order to reach 90 degrees within the Middle Bakken. Schlumberger tools and services was to set the whip-stock. </p>

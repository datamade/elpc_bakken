As such only estimates and a projection to the bit could be done using the single survey taken. <br/>Once Middle Bakken structure was changed to a thickness of 30 feet based on offset wells; instead of a thickness of 37 feet based on the lower shale strike that occurred during the curve; dip calculations, shale strikes, and upper gamma marker placement correlated and conﬁrmed a thickness near 30 feet. (at this time it is unknown if the Middle Bakken actually thinned or if estimated of the lower Bakken shale in the curve <br/>portion of the well were skewed.) </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Waypoint 4 redirected the wellbore back up between 9,348’ TVD and 9,3 58’ TVD at 14,000’ MD. Drilling from 12,736’ MD to 14,863’ MD, the wellbore maintained a position within the target window below the Upper Gamma Marker. Samples consisted of a sub rounded to rounded cream to light gray dolomite with oil intermittently observed in samples slightly diminishing as the mud weight increased. Gamma ranged tightly between 58 API and 70 API while gas averaged 1,000 units while going through the gas buster. Flares ranged from three to ten feet high and was observed sporadically. ROP averaged 275 feet per minute while rotating. <br/>The Upper gamma marker was again observed at 14,863’ MD (TVD 9,348’) yielding a dip of 89.94 degrees. Waypoint 6 extended out to TD dropping by one foot to accommodate for the said dip. <br/>From 15,000’ MD to a TD of 16,547 ’ MD, gamma ranged tightly between 65 and 80 API and drilled at an average of 275’/hr. Gas slowly dropped to average 700 units while open to the gas buster due to an increase in mud weight. Samples consisted of a <br/>rounded partially unconsolidated sucrose like dolomite. The Upper Gamma Marker was observed one last time at 16,395’ MD (TVD 9,351) to conﬁrm a dip of 89.94 degrees. <br/>On October 31st 2014 the Parshall 403-3534H reached a TD of 16,547’ MI) at 17:42 CST. Liner was set at 16,542’ MD and hung at 8,788’ MD. At this time the Parshall 403-3534H is awaiting production status. </p>

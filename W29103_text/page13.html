Samples observed contained light tan brown to tan brown carbonaceous limestone with inter—bedded dark laminations. Oil shows in the upper portion of the Mission Canyon revealed light green yellow dull ﬂuorescence and thin to moderate hazy cuts (invert contamination). ROP through the Mission Canyon averaged .59 min/ft. In the upper portion of the Mission Canyon gas averaged 35 units with a peak of 48 units. Samples between 8,100’ MD and 8,200’ MI) contained moderate amounts of multi-colored slightly calcareous shale including green, red, and purple and orange. Gas through this area averaged only 52 units and drilled at an average of .53min/ﬁ. This area tended to be a transitional area as samples below consisted of a tan to brown carbonaceous, more dolomitic limestone with even yellow ﬂuorescence. Over—all the Mission canyon measured a total thickness of 618 feet. </p>

A reverse ROP break from .43 min/ft to .83min/ﬁ was also noted to help conﬁrm. <br/>The upper portion of the Lodgepole consisted of a light to dark gray argillaceous limestone with trace red to black ﬁssile shale observed in samples. Gas averaged 76 units with bump tests performed to insure accuracy. The Upper portion from 8,508’ to 8,831’ averaged .58 min/ﬂ. while rotating. <br/>On October 19, 2014 at 3:10 PM am a KOP of8,83l’ MD was reached and a trip out of the hole was made to attach a curve assembly consisting of a 8.75” Hughes T505 bit and Phoenix 2.38 bend, 7/8 lobe, HR motor. </p>

    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling resumed on October 19, 2014 at 11:00 PM with a target landing of 9,3 16’ TVD between 80 and 85 degrees. During the construction of the curve, ROP while sliding averaged .92min/ft. Samples from 8,831’ MD to 9,270’ MD were largely the same consisting of an argillaceous gray dolomite with occasional dark laminations. The Upper and lower Virden markers as well as shale marker 1,2 and 3 were correlated based on the Prognosis and averaged l to 20 feet higher gradually coming back to the prognosis as the wellbore descended beginning at the 2“Cl shale marker. <br/>Over all the Lodgpole formation totaled a thickness of 763 feet. Gas throughout the Lodgpole averaged 40 units with an average mud weight of 10.45 lbs. </p>

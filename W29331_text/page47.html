Wisness 150-100-23-14— 7H, a horizontal well, was drilled by H&P 255 in the Middle Bakken targeting the Middle Bakken Dolomite 10 to 20 feet into the Middle Bakken. The Wisness 150-100— 23—14—7H well spudded November 7th, 2014 and reached a total depth of 20,687’ MD on November 22, 2014. Wellsite geological services began at 8,500 feet in the Heath Formation. The gas detection system used was Neset Total Gas. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected in the vertical section and curve. Fiﬁy foot samples were collected in the horizontal. All lagged samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 8, 5 00 — 10,816 ’ MD </p>

Samples consisted of a mix of Salt, Anhydrite, and Limestone. Sample characteristics showed clear, angular, crystalline, translucent, moderate anhydrite, rusty brown to orange, reddish brown, off white to cream white, trace limestone, white mineral to dull yellow ﬂuorescence, and no cut. <br/>Base Last Salt 9,586 ' MD 9,559’ TVD -7,240' SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered at 9,586’ MD; -7,240’ SS, and was picked by the last sample with salt present, as well as an increase in the rate of penetration of the last salt bed. Samples then became beds of limestone and anhydrite, until the Mission Canyon. </p>

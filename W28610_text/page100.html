    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation’s Bartleson 13-18-3m is a grassroots well located in the NW of the SW Section 18 T153N R92W in Mountrail County, North Dakota. It is a single lateral horizontal well targeting the lower portion of the Middle Bakken siltstone as well as tan sandstone in the D facies, drilled on a 2560-acre spacing unit. The well was spudded on July 10, 2014 and reached a total depth of 20,032' at 2:30 AM CST on August 16, 2014. Dave Edwards and Chris Calame were onsite for well site supervision, along with Scott Strahm and Stephanie Connole representing Neset Consulting Service, Inc for wellsite geological services. <br/>Wellsite services began at the logging depth of 8,400’ MD, at 11:15 PM CST, on July 25, 2014. Two man geological services were used for the vertical, curve and lateral. A Total Gas detector was utilized for gas analysis. Samples were caught every thirty feet throughout the vertical section and curve. Samples were caught every ﬁfty feet through the lateral. All samples caught were saved to be archived at the ND Core and Sample Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical Section <br/>The Base of the Last Salt, the main correlatory marker to this point came in at 8,699’ MD and 8,675’ TVD, 4’ low to the prognosis. <br/>MISSION CANYON 8,895 ’ MD 8,870’ TVD -6, 796’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon top was picked at 8,895’ MD and 8,870’ TVD a drop in ROP, from .6 min/ﬂ to .93 min/ﬂ a spike in differential pressure and torque and a change in sample texture and color. The Mission Canyon came in 10’ low of the prognosis and drilled consistently with ROP between .28 and 1.2 min/ﬂ. Samples in the Mission Canyon were primarily blocky argillaceous limestone that was brown to gray brown with traces off white to light cream gray anhydrite and medium gray dolomite throughout. There were no signiﬁcant shows in the Mission Canyon. <br/>LODGEPOLE 9,5 72’ MD 9, 494’ TVD -7,420’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole formation came in at 9,572” MD and TVD of 9,494’MD. The Lodgepole was encountered 4’ low to the prognosis, and picked off of differential pressure and torque, and confirmed with a sudden increase in gamma. Gamma increased up ﬁom 28.2 API units to 49.12 API units to mark the top of the Lodgepole. Samples in the Lodgepole were mostly light to medium gray tan to gray brown limestone with minimal ﬂuorescence and dull weak to slow milky yellow cuts. <br/>THE CURVE <br/>The Bartleson l3-l8-3XH curve was drilled with a Security MMD55M #2 8.75” bit along with a Baker Hughes mud motor set to 2.4 degrees and an invert mud system. There was a 30’ rotation made from this point before the sliding for the curve commenced at the kick off point of 9,800’ MD. </p>

The gamma reached 144.65 API units while in the False Bakken. The samples for the False Bakken <br/>consisted of cream gray to gray tan, with blocky to platy limestone. The samples had weak milky yellow cuts with a peak of 180 units of gas seen in this interval. <br/>SCALLION 10,485 ’ MD 10,284’ TVD -8,210’ SS <br/>The Scallion was the next formation encountered. The scallion came in at 10,485’ MD and 10,284’ TVD, 9’ low to prognosis. The gamma cooled back down to 53.8 API units in the Scallion. The Scallion consisted of mostly cream buff Limestone with slow dull milky yellow cuts. Gas peaked at 236 units of gas along with fair milky cuts. <br/>UPPER BAKKEN 1 0, 526’ MD 10,296 ’ TVD -8,222 ’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale came in at 10,526’ MD, and 10,296’ TVD, this was 8’ low to the prognosis. The gamma reached 689.39 units at this point. Background gas averaged 277.9 <br/>units, peaking 679 units. Samples in the Upper Bakken were black, carbonaceous blocky shale, with instant milky yellow cuts. <br/>MIDDLE BAKKEN 10,633’ MD 10,31 7’ TVD -8,243 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at a MD of 10,633’ MD and 10,317’ TVD, 13’ low to the prognosis. The Middle Bakken was picked based on the change in samples and a decrease in gamma from 689.39 units down to 53.39 units API. The Middle Bakken samples consisted mostly of a light to dark cream gray tan platy siltstone. Gas peaked at 5450 units of gas along with fair milky cuts. The curve was landed at a total depth of 10,742’ MD on Monday, August 7, 2014 at 11:15 PM CST. 7” intermediate casing was set to 10,733’ Nﬂ). </p>

The wellbore would begin rising gradually in the formation following the drilling of the shoe. A downslide was put in at 10,847’ MD to send the wellbore dropping in the formation. This slide would send the wellbore <br/>into the clean “B” facies at 11,041’ MD. The drop would continue and send the wellbore through the B/C marker at 11,275’ MD. <br/>3 high side slides were put in starting at 11,184’ MD to prevent the continued drop in the formation. These slides would send the wellbore rising in the formation back into the clean “B” facies at 11,800. This encounter with the B/C marker would indicate a slidght steepening in the formation to 90.57 degrees. <br/>The wellbore would exit the clean “B” facies at 12,045’ MD. The rise in rotation would send the wellbore back up into the clean “B” faceis at 12,439’ MD. A downslide was put in at <br/>12,475’ M1) to prevent the continued rise in the formation. This slide would send the wellbore through the base of the clean “B” facies at 12,627 ’ MD. This encounter would indicate a steepening in the formation to 9069 degrees. <br/>A high side slide would send the wellbore rising in the formation at 12,751’ MD. This rise would continue and send the wellbore into the clean “B” facies at 13,165’ MD. A downslide </p>

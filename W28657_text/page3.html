The Mission Canyon was picked from rate of penetration, and sample changes. The formation consisted of Limestone: Brown, light brown, tan, blocky, packstone, carbonaceous, ﬁrm, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow/green ﬂuorescence, faint thin streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.69 min/ft and the background gases averaged 81 units. <br/>Lodgepole 1 0,298 ' MD 10,29 7' T V!) - 7, 92 7' SS <br/>The Lodgepole was observed next. The Lodgepole was picked based on sample, gamma, and rate of penetration changes. The samples consisted of Limestone: Light gray to gray brown, brown, light brown, tan, ﬁrm to brittle, packstone, carbonaceous, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow, green ﬂuorescence, slow streaming to a weak cloudy yellow, green cut. The kick-off point was reached at 10,610' MD on August 18, 2014 around 2:55 AM., CST. Reached bottom and began drilling the curve August 19, 2014 around 12 AM CST. The landing target was set at 1 1,055’ TVD, 20’ feet into the Middle Bakken. The rate of penetration averaged 0.97 mirﬂﬁ. and background gas averaged around 80 units. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The TD of Curve#1 was reached at 10,832' MD around 7: 15 AM CST on August 19, 2014, due to losing the BHA down hole. The plan was to sidetrack around it starting at 10,692' MD. While tripping into the hole at around 9,468’ MD on August 20, 2014, around 5:30 AM the lost BHA was found, The decision was then made to trip out of the hole for a mill bit and trip into the hole to push down the lost BHA in order to start the sidetrack, Finished tripping into the hole on August 20, 2014, and started to push the ﬁsh to bottom from 6 PM to 7:45 PM. Finished tripping out of the hole for the curve assembly <br/>around 2 AM. Then started tripping into the hole with the curve assembly around 3 :30 AM, <br/>Sidetrack #1 1 0, 692’ MD to 20,994 ’ MD <br/>Sidetrack #1 began around 12:10 PM. CST, at 10,692’ MD on August 21, 2014. Sidetrack #1 Attempt #1 SUCCCSSﬁJl. Then the decision was made to trip out of the hole due to slow ROP at 10,895’ MD on August 22nd, 2014 around 3:00 AM. The landing target was adjusted to 11,059' TVD aﬁer LP marker 8.The rate of penetration averaged 1.03 min/ﬂ. and background gas averaged around 138 units. </p>

The Upper Bakken Shale was picked based on gamma and samples. The samples changed to Shale: Black, dark brown, blocky, ﬁssile, gritty to smooth, argillaceous, ﬁrm to hard, brittle, no porosity, no ﬂuorescence, instant fair streaming cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.48 min/ﬂ and background gas was around 2223 units, with a max of 4,577 units </p>

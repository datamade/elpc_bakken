Drilling times in the Lodgepole below KOP were between 1-5 minutes sliding. Gas varied between 9—3 17 units. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the Lodgepole to correlate to the JB 11-6TFH hole. Target stayed at 10,3 59’ based on Lodgepole correlations. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 10,276’ MD 10,205 ’ T VD -8,133 ’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was entered at 10,205’ TVD. Background gas was from 36 to 317 units in the shale. A typical sample was Shale: Black, very dark gray, carbonaceous, calcareous, pyritic, gritty, blocky, even pale yellow ﬂuorescence, instant bright green milky cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,301’MD 10,219’ TVD -8,147’ SS <br/>At 10,219’ TVD the Middle Bakken was encountered. This top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The sample lithology of the Middle Bakken consisted of sandstone. A typical sample exhibited medium to light gray sandstone, light to medium grayish brown, with beige to oiT-white inclusions, very ﬁne grained, subrounded, calcareous, limey cementation, moderate sorting, poor intergranular porosity, scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, cloudy bright yellow green cut. <br/>Lower Bakken Shale 10,436 ’ MD 10,286’ T VD -8,214 ’ SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale was entered at 10,286’ TVD. Background gas was from 124 to 286 units in the shale. A typical sample was Shale: Medium gray, grayish brown, trace dark gray, some mottled, carbonaceous, pyritic, gritty, blocky, even pale yellow green ﬂuorescence, instant bright cloudy yellow green cut. </p>

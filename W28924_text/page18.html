Surrounding wells suggested the Lower Bakken was a reliable marker for making a target change so aﬁer it suggested a target of 10,164’ TVD the target was lowered to 10,163’ TVD (anticipated 1’ of structural rise). Upon drilling into the Three Forks, markers did not conﬂict with the target of 10,163’ TVD so no additional changes were made. The ideal target was encounter 24’ into the formation at 10,163’ TVD. The curve landed only about Vz’ lower than planned at a TVD of 10,163.6' with an inclination of 883° at 12:45 am CDT on September 27, 2014. <br/>Upper Bakken 10,088’MD 10,032’ TVD -8,126’SS </p>

The isochore thickness of the shale was found to be 18’ during the curve, as expected. The drilling rate increased from about 42fph to 77fph as the bit entered the shale. Formation gas increased immediately after encountering the Upper Bakken with a high of 1587 units and an averaged 911 units. A sample from the Upper Bakken was described as a black to brown black, organic rich, blocky shale with very dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a strong milky blue white blooming cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,118 ’ MD 10,050 ’ TVD -8,144 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at 10,118’ MD and a TVD of 10,050’. Upon drilling into the Middle Bakken, ROP slowed to an average of 35fph and gas dropped to an average of 440 units. Formation gas and oil shows were relatively good in the Middle Bakken. Samples were generally described as a gray tan silty and dolomitic sandstone with milky diffuse cuts. A sample from lower in the target window showed more prevalent calcitic cement than overlying stratum and interbedded siltstone was more common. <br/>Lower Bakken 10,212 ’ MD 10,098 ’ TVD -8,192 ’ SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale was encountered at 10,212’ measured depth and 10,098’ true vertical depth. The isochore thickness of the shale was found to be 37’, as expected. The drilling rates increased from 35fph to 67fph once the wellbore entered the shale. Formation gas increased immediately aﬁer encountering the Lower Bakken with a high of 1076 units and an averaged 670 units. Samples from the Lower Bakken were described as a black to brownish black, very carbonaceous, gritty shale with yellow green ﬂuorescence and a strong milky blue white broad streaming cut. <br/>Three Forks 10,319’ MD 10,139’ TVD -8,233 ’SS </p>

Samples from the Three Forks Formation were described as a siltstone with varying amounts of clay, silt, sand and dolomite. The drilling rates decreased from 70fph to 36fph once the wellbore entered the Three Forks. Formation gas decreased as the wellbore entered the less carbonaceous Three Forks with an average of just 265 units. The target top was encountered 18’ into the formation at a TVD of 10,157’. Samples from the warm gamma facies were generally a light green gray color with higher amounts of silt and clay. The samples with higher amounts of sand and dolomite were found in strata with low gamma readings (generally below 50 api). Above the target window was generally sandier and it had better oil shows than the underlying strata. The curve was completed at 12:45 am CDT on September 27, 2014 at 10,503’ MD. <br/>Lateral 10,488 — 20,035 ’ MD The lateral began after drilling through 7” casing with a 6” Reed SKHI613M type bit at 10,488’ <br/>MD and then entering open formation. The drilling ﬂuid was altered from oil based mud to brine for the lateral. Targets were originally projected ahead with no dip as early lateral azimuth was near the </p>

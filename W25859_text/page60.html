    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">a survey depth of 18,485ﬁ. Upward slides were used to level oﬂ‘ the inclination near formational dip of 89.9 degrees. The inclination built to as high as 92.49 degrees, after being deﬂected upward before reaching the cool gamma marker. Drilling continued trying to decrease in section. While doing so, the inclination decreased to as low as 8883 degrees, at a survey depth of 20,1 129:. While decreasing in section, the cool gamma marker was seen at a measured depth of 19,920ﬁ. Once this was seen, upward slides were used to increase the inclination. While in the lower cool gamma, the inclination was decreasing while rotating. Difﬁculties arose while trying to slide up out of it. The samples decreased in grain size, and increased in shale at a measured depth of 20,250ﬁ. With the sample change, the gamma increased to near 120 API. The inclination continued to decrease, even with upward slides. The inclination decreased to as low as 86.39 degrees a survey depth of 20,244ﬁ. While sliding upward, rubber was seen in samples. The decision was made to trip out of the hole at a measured depth of 20,400ﬁ, due to spikes in differential pressure and inability to continue sliding. Upon tripping out of the hole, the bit, mudmotor, MWD, and Hydra-pulse (shock sub and agitator) were all replaced. Aﬁer tripping back in the hole, the trip gas was circulated out before drilling resumed. This yielded a trip gas of 1,008 units and a 15ﬁ ﬂare. After drilling was resumed, several upward slides were used to climb in section and exit the lower shaley bench. While doing so, the well path was deﬂected downward several times. <br/>Drilling continued to a measured depth of 22,055ﬁ. This was called total depth, due to hard line restrictions. Total depth for the lateral was reached at 3 :50 pm CT, February 25, 2015. <br/>Conclusion </p>

It was moderately argillaceous, calcareous to limey in part, and had poor induration. The siltstone had poor porosity, and interbedded dolomite The dolomite was micro to very ﬁne grained, and limey and sucrosic in part. The samples had spotty dull yellow ﬂuorescence, and fast cloudy cuts. Background gas while drilling in the Middle Bakken Siltstone was near 768 units. </p>

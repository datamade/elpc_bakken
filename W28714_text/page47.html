Oil device will be Coriolis meter using Electronic Flow Measurement (EFM) and appropriate industry and manufacturer standards. Each well will have a tank that can be isolated and used as a test tank for the proving of its Coriolis meter. <br/>Per well continuous measurement of gas volumes will be used to allocate actual standard condition gas volumes delivered through central facility “gas sales” meters back to individual well(s). Gas measurement device will be either orifice plate or wedge meters using EFM and appropriate industry and manufacturer standards. <br/>Per well continuous measurement water volumes will be used to allocate actual water volumes transported out of central facility back to individual well(s). Water device will be Vortex Shedding, Electro-Magnetic, or Turbine using EFM and appropriate industry and manufacturer standards. <br/>Please reference, 1) A map showing the location of the central facility and the location of each well, 2) The Facilities Commingling Diagram, 3) A list of the manufacturer, size and type of meters to be used, and 4) the Commingled Production Allocation Method to be used to determine individual well production. </p>

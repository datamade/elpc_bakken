The ﬁnal curve TD depth of 9,639’ MD was conﬁrmed when the bottoms up sample at this depth contained bluish gray Middle Bakken dolomite with trace amounts of very dark brown/gray to dull black <br/>shale. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">After the intermediate 7” casing shoe was set to 9,638’ MD, drilling began in the horizontal section at 9:35 PM CDT on October 9, 2014. The Middle Bakken top was ofﬁcially determined at 9,629’ MD/-7,374’ SS from a decrease in gamma values as the gamma tool transitioned from the UBS into the Middle Bakken dolomite. The curve was generally leveled off within the drilling window at a ~90° angle near survey depth of 10,274’ MD, and the GR Marker was ﬁrst encountered at 9,752’ MD/-7,385’ SS. The formation dip angle from 9,600’ — 1 1,300’ MD averaged 90.3 degrees, and from 11,300’ — 12,200’ averaged 90.15 degrees. The formation ﬂattened to approximately 90 degrees from 12,200’ — 13,700’, then angled up again at an average of 90.15 degrees from 13,700’ MD to TD of 16,415’ MD. <br/>Middle Bakken 9, 629’ MD 9,327’ TVD -7,3 74 ’ SS GR Marker 9, 752 ’ MD 9,338’ TVD -7,385’ SS <br/>The ﬁrst section of the horizontal for Parshall 93-2827H was drilled from the landing target window of 9,340 - 9350’ TVD set at 9,650’ MD, to Way Point 1, set at 1 1,000’ MD, with a target window of 9,330 — 9,340’ TVD. Within Way Point 1, the GR Marker was encountered for the second time at 10,095’ MD/-7,383’ SS. Also within Way Point 1, an MWD tool failure occurred at 10,451’ MD, with trip to surface beginning at 12:00 PM on October 10, 2014, and resumption of drilling beginning at 8:15 PM CDT on October 10, 2014. Also within Way Point 1, round trip to surface to change out mud motor began at 4:00 AM CDT on October 1 1, 2014 at 10,73 7’ MD, with drilling resuming at 2:20 PM on October 11, 2014. <br/>GR Marker 10,095 ’ MD 9,336 ’ TVD -7,383 ’ SS <br/>The second section of the horizontal was drilled to Way Point 2, set at 13,000’ MD, with a target window of 9,325 — 9,335’ TVD. Between the landing target and Way Point 2, drilling involved sliding to make an azimuth turn from approximately 112 degrees to approximately 136 degrees, which was accomplished near 11,250’ MD. Also within Way Point 2, a washed drill pipe in the drill string was realized, and a trip out of the hole to ﬁnd washed pipe began at 11,637’ MD at 1:40 AM CDT on October 12, 2014. Aﬁer washed pipe was found and replaced, a trip back to bottom occurred, and drilling resumed at 5:40 AM CDT on October 12, 2014. The GR Marker was also encountered for the third, fourth, and ﬁfth times at 11,255’ MD/-7,377’ SS, and 12,135’ MD/—7,374’ SS, and 12,700’ MD/-7,374’ SS within Way Point 2. </p>

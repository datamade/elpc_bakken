Road Pinedale WY <br/>White Mountain Oeratin, LLC DETAILS OF WORK <br/>I; Hunt Oil requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to ' v days for the referenced well under NDAC <br/>43-02-03-55. Hunt Oil intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application fro Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within theBgodays previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of or suspend any obligation under any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Hunt Oil understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43—02-03-19 & 19.1). Hunt Oil will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig withing days after spudding the Well with the smaller drilling rig. <br/>24-HOUR PRODUCTION RATE <br/>            <br/>           <br/>        <br/>    <br/>  <br/>                                                                      <br/>   <br/>        <br/>       <br/>on 174/5 ca Mike mars 4r 7a/-220— .9 w/rH 5/4413 r TDJ—up'a Company Telephone Number (214)  1900 North Akard Street <br/>FOR STATE USE ONLY <br/>                    <br/>       <br/>     <br/>    <br/>        <br/>  <br/>City Zip Code ‘A k n L ' , A Dahne Basequ , I ,- I I Authorized Agent for Hunt Oil - KLJ September 17, 2014 Engineering Technician <br/>Email Address daphne.baseflug@kljeng.com </p>

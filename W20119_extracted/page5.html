A mud log will be run from Base of Last Salt to TD 8 on all laterals: Mudlog to include: total gas chromatograph and sample cuttings - <br/>10‘ sample intervals in vertical hole 8 30' intervals in laterals. A CBUGR log will be run from deepest free-fall depth in 7 inch casing to surface, An MWD GRIROP log will also be run from KOP (where the CBL will tie into) to TD of lateral. 2. Open hole logs are not planned. <br/>3. No DST‘s are planned at this time. <br/>HZS A minor H2S show may be present from below Base Last Salt to KOP, If noticed, RU H2S safety trailer etc. <br/>Maximum Formation Pressure and Temp 1. Normal formation pressure gradient is expected (up to 0.5 psi/ft or 9.6 ppg) from surface to the Bakken Shale. The Bakken Shale, Bakken Middle Member, and Three Forks may be over pressured up as much as 0.66 psi/ft (12.8 ppg). 2. The maximum anticipated BHT is 280 degrees F. or less. <br/>BOP Equipment Requirements <br/>See attached diagram detailing BOPE speciﬁcations. <br/>1. Rig will be equipped with upper and lower kelly cocks with handles available. <br/>2. Inside BOP and TIW valves will be available to use on all sizes and threads of DP used on well. <br/>3. BOP accumulator will have enough capacity to close HCR valve, close all rams plus annular preventer 8 retain minimum of 200 psi above precharge on the closing manifold without the use of closing pumps. The ﬂuid reservoir capacity shall be at least double the usable ﬂuid volume of the accumulator system capacity 8 the ﬂuid level shall be mainatained at manufacturers recommendation. There will be 2 additional sources of power for the closing pumps (electric and air). Sufficient N2 bottles will be available and will be recharged when pressure falls below manufacturers minimum <br/>4. BOP ram preventers will be tested to 5,000 psi using a test plug when initially installed and after 7 inch casing is nippled up and at 30 day intervals. Test BOP 8 casing strings to 1,500 psi just prior to drilling out 9-5/ " and 7" casing shoes. Function test rams and hydraulically operated remote choke line valve daily (preferably at every crew change). <br/>5. Remote valve for BOP rams, HCR 8 choke shall be placed in a location that is readily available to Driller. The remote BOP valve shall be capable of closing and opening the rents. <br/>6. Hand wheels on BOP shall be equipped with locking devices. A locking device shall be placed on annular preventer line valve 8 must be locked in the open position. This lock shall only be removed when the closing unit is inoperative. <br/>Dr1|ling Fluid and Related Equipment 1. Pumps shall be equipped with stroke counters with displays located in dog house. Slow pump speed shall be recorded on drilling report <br/>daily after mudding up. 2. A Pit Volume Totalizer will be installed and the readout will be displayed in the dog house. <br/>Page 1 </p>

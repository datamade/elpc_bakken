    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Miller 14-12TFH is a Three Forks well laterally drilled by Unit 120 for Whiting Oil and Gas Corp. (API# 33-105-03 741) and is located at Section 12 T156N R97W, 630’ FSL & 790’ FWL. The bottom hole coordinates are in Section 1 T156N R97W, 718.18 FNL & 1327.52’ FWL. The well was spudded on January 14, 2015. A total measured depth of 19,760’ MD was reached at 9:30 am on February 23, 2015. All data is either logged by Jonathan Stoltman or Anthony Samoski, of Neset consulting. Wellsite geological services began at 7,225’ MD above the Tyler on February 12, 2015 at 3:45 pm CST. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected. All samples were washed, <br/>catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. </p>

At 7923’ MD unit 120 executed a planned trip for a bit at 3:30 am CST on February 13, 2015. Drilling operations resumed at 12:15 pm CST on February 13, 2015. The entire vertical section was drilled with invert diesel, and alter intermediate casing the drilling ﬂuid used was Brine. Rates of penetration for the vertical <br/>section averaged 87 feet/hour with a maximum of 286 feet/hour. The vertical ended at the KOP of 9,624’ MD on February 14, 2015. <br/>Tyler 7,268’ MD 7,265 ’ T VD -5,001 ’ SS <br/>The Tyler formation was reached shortly alter logging began. It came in at 7,268’ MD and 7,265’ TVD. This was 21 feet low to prognosis. Gamma was the main indicator <br/>in identifying the Tyler. Typical samples were red siltstone with trace amounts of light gray limestone. </p>

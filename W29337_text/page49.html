The samples after the last salt became limestone and dolomite until the Mission Canyon. <br/>[Mission Canyon 8, 794’ MD 8, 791 ’ T VD -6,527’ SS <br/>Mission Canyon was picked by the lithology change and also ROP. The average ROP through this formation is 101 feet/hour with a range of 24—240 feet/hour. The gas count averaged 75 units with a range of 11—164 units. The formation is dominated by limestone with minor amounts of anhydrite and dolomite. Samples looked like: LIMESTONE: Cream, tan, light tan, cream tan, light brown, packstone to wackestone, argillaceous, calcareous, carbonaceous, mottled, ﬁrm, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy cut. <br/>Lodgepole 9,425 ’ 1WD 9, 422’ T VD - 7,158’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole was identiﬁed at 9,425’ MD and 9,422’ TVD from the ROP and sample change along with gamma. Drilling rates in the Lodgepole averaged 47 feet/hour and ranged from 12-139 ﬁ/hr with gas ranging from 11 to 195 units. Typical samples were: LHVIESTONE: Light gray, medium gray, gray, light brown, tan, light tan, cream, off white, packstone to wackestone, calcareous, carbonaceous, argillaceous, soﬁ to ﬁrm, fair intergranular porosity, scattered bright yellow ﬂuorescence, instant cloudy cut. KOP was reached in this formation at 9,624’ MD on February 14, 2015. <br/>Curve 9, 624’ —— 10,506’ MD <br/>Drilling times in the Lodgepole below KOP averaged 1.31 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 11 to 195 units. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the Lodgepole to correlate to the Miller 14-12H, and the Bergstrom 11—13TFH wells. One target adjustment was made during the curve. It was made after the well encountered the Upper Bakken Shale, the decision was made to move the target up from 10,189’ TVD to 10,186’ TVD. Samples below KOP were: LIMESTONE: Light gray, cream, tan, light brown, cream tan, off white, packstone to wackestone, soft to ﬁrm, argillaceous, calcareous, carbonaceous, poor intergranular porosity, scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy cut. The EOC was reached at 10,506th at 4:00 am CST on February 16, 2015. <br/>False Bakken 10,138’ MD 10,071 ’ TVD -7,807’ SS <br/>The False Bakken came in at a MD of 10,138’ with the TVD of 10,071’ it was picked off of Gamma. The correlation sheet did not show a target change so there was no </p>

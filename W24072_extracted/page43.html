If it does not, an explanation shall be given. <br/>If a parasite string was used in the drilling of a well, the size, depth set, cement volume used to plug, and the date plugged shall be included. This information may be included in the "Additional Information" portion of the report or included as an attachment. <br/>In the "Perforation & Open Hole Intervals" table, each borehole should be identiﬁed in the "Well Bore" column (vertical, sidetrack 1, lateral 1, etc.). On horizontal or directional wells, the following information shall be entered in the table if applicable: pilot hole total depth, kick-off point, casing windows, original lateral total depth, and all sidetracked interval starting and ending footages. <br/>In the "Production" section, list all the current producing open hole or perforated intervals associated with the production rates reported. Oil, gas, and water rates and recoveries from perforations or laterals tested but mt included in the completion should be included in the "Additional Information" portion of the report or included as an attachment. <br/>In The “Date Well Completed” portion of the form please report the appropriate date as follows: <br/>- An oil well shall be considered completed when the ﬁrst oil is produced through wellhead equipment into tanks from the ultimate producing interval after casing has been run. <br/>- A gas well shall be considered complete when the well is capable of producing gas through wellhead equipment from the ultimate producing zone after casing has been run. <br/>- For EOR or SWD wells, please report the date the well is capable of injection through tubing and packer into the permitted injection zone.

    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Slawson Exploration Company’s Howo 8-33-4TF2H NW NW Section 33 T152N R92W is a single Second Bench Three Forks horizontal well located 2 miles south of New Town in Mountrail County, North Dakota. The drilling rig, CanElson #41, began drilling on October 11, 2014 and ceased drilling after the lateral reached a total depth of 19,929’ on November 1, 2014. The bottom hole location is located in the SEA SW% of Section 4 T151N R92W. <br/>Howo 8-33-4TF2H landed the curve and drilled laterally within the Second Bench of the Three Forks Formation (Late Devonian) within the Williston Basin. The vertical and curve segments were drilled with an 8%” bit and cased with 7” intermediate casing to a measured depth (MD) of 10,523’. The lateral extended another 9,406’ to a total depth of 19,929’. It was drilled with a 6” bit and cased with 4 1/2” liner. The drilling ﬂuid was oil based mud for the vertical and curve segments but during the lateral it was substituted with brine. <br/>Wellsite geological services began within the Kibbey Formation at a MD of 7,830’. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected during the vertical and curve, and fifty foot lagged samples were collected in the lateral. Samples were cleaned, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological <br/>Survey core library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Vertical 7,830’ - 9, 730’ MD <br/>Logging services began in the Kibbey Formation at a measured depth of 7,830’ at 3:30 pm CDT on October 18, 2014. The vertical segment was drilled with a Reed DS616M-01 type bit which was added at 7,226’ MD. The primary off-set well was Howo S-33-4TFH as it was drilled on the same pad as Howo 8-33—4TF 2H. The samples collected within the Kibbey Formation were generally described as a light brown to red brown, slightly calcareous, dolomitic shaly siltstone. The ﬁrst sample from the Kibbey Formation had traces of the Kibbey Lime Marker which was described as a vuggy grainy limestone with traces of anhydrite. Formation gas in the Kibbey Formation averaged 117 units with the highest reading of 138 units detected as residual gas from the Kibbey Lime. A Pason chromatograph gas detection system was used to monitor gas. The Charles Formation was encountered shortly after logging services <br/>began. <br/>Charles 7,902 ’ MD 7,901 ’ TVD -5,995 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Charles Formation was encountered at 7,902’ measured depth (MD) when a relatively massive salt unit, indicative of the Charles top, was encountered. Lithology identiﬁed in the Charles included salt, anhydrite, mudstone, crystalline limestone, and dolomitic limestone. Fast and consistent penetration rates deﬁned the Charles’ salt benches fairly well. Along with gamma data, drilling signatures such as differential pressure, weight on bit, rotary and torque were also useful in determining the depths of the salts with their indications of easy drilling. Penetration rates averaged 65fph throughout the Charles Formation but up to 127fph in the salts. Formation gas readings were fairly consistent at about 80 units, however, surges in gas were at times detected directly below impermeable evaporate layers. The highest readings were detected at the base of the formation in sandier, more permeable layers which gave readings near 100 units. The heavier gases were also more prevalent near <br/>the Charles base. </p>

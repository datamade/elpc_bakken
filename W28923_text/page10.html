    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Lateral l 0, 523 — 19,929 ’ MD <br/>The lateral began after drilling through 7” casing with a 6” NOV SKHI613M type bit at 10,523’ MD and then entering open formation. The drilling ﬂuid was altered from oil based mud to brine for the lateral. Targets were originally projected ahead with an 8985" dip which then transitioned into a ﬂatter <br/>dip halfway through the lateral. After drilling out of the casing shoe, gamma data was not successfully recovered so the decision <br/>was made to immediately TOOH for a new MWD tool. When drilling resumed, inclination dropped and slides were implemented to increase inclination. The original 6 blade PDC bit exhibited an obvious tendency to drop inclination in rotation. Most slides with the ﬁrst assembly were to control the inclination drop. The wellbore brieﬂy moved above the target window near 12,000’ MD and a small increase in formation gas was detected. The bit’s inclination immediately dropped and the bit moved back down into the lower half of the target window. Several slides were implemented to ascend back into the top half of the target window but the bit’s tendency to drop and deﬂect prevented it. Eventually the wellbore moved up above the target center but the decision to TOOH was made because of a faulty MWD tool. A new bit, motor and agitator were replaced along with the MWD tool. When drilling resumed, the average ROP was considerably faster because the new 5 blade bit tracked formation and did not drop in rotation which decreased the slide percentage. Warm gamma encountered at the end of the lateral suggested a stratigraphic position near the target center. Using this as a reference point, the total formation drop over the extent of the lateral was 19' which gave the formation an average angle of dip of 89.89°. The majority of the structural drop occurred in the first 4,000’ of the lateral with dip calculations averaging 8981". The second half of the lateral was signiﬁcantly ﬂatter with dip calculations averaging 8995". Slides were often implemented to counter the bit’s tendency to walk left in rotation. The slides kept the well path right of the proposed path for all but the last 400’ of the lateral. Total depth for Howo 8-33-4TF2H was reached at 12:30 am on November 1, 2014 at 19,929‘ MD near the target center. <br/>While analyzing samples from the Second Bench of the Three Forks Formation, there did not appear to be a stratum that provided signiﬁcantly better oil shows; however, it did appear as though the least impressive oil shows were often found in the red beds (oxidized stratum). Samples from the warm gamma facies were generally either a reddish gray or a light green gray color with high amounts of silt and clay. The reddish beds are believed to be the result of oxidation while the greenish beds are from anoxic environment. The samples with higher amounts of sand and dolomite were found in the multiple cool gamma facies. The target window was generally an orange tan to reddish gray with a few exceptions of greenish gray shaley siltstone and cream tan dolomitic siltstone. Drill rates were higher in the clay rich strata (warm gamma) and slower in the cooler gamma strata which is likely due to higher dolomite and sand content. <br/>ROP was fairly consistent throughout the lateral while rotating but slides became slightly slower with increasing drag down hole. An agitator was added to the assembly at the start of the lateral. MWD quality was not significantly affected by the agitator. The average ROP over the extent of the lateral was 1 14fph but often over 200fph while rotating. The average ROP was considerably faster after replacing the bit at 16,876' MD because the new type bit tracked formation and did not drop in rotation, decreasing the slide percentage. The original bit and motor were used throughout the lateral. There was one other tn'p early in the lateral (10,646’ MD) due to a failed MWD tool. <br/>Natural gas readings in the Three Forks Formation seemed to vary only slightly depending on stratigraphic position. Formation gas remained fairly steady throughout the lateral; however, it often increased while the wellbore moved into the top half of the target window. Any decrease in formation gas generally occurred in the argillaceous warm gamma strata while the highest readings were often in the more arenaceous cool gamma strata. The cool gamma facies appeared to be the best reservoir rock in the Second Bench of the Three Forks due to its low clay content and higher grain content. The warm gamma facies had low permeability and were generally described as light green gray and reddish gray argillaceous siltstone. Formation gas averaged 60 units throughout the lateral with the highest reading of 125 units at the end of the lateral. </p>

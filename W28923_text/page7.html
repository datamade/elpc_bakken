Above the Last Salt, the Greenpoint Anhydrite showed distinctive slower drilling which was useful in determining stratigraphic position. ROP through the last salt bench averaged 80fph which slowed to 64fph and became erratic in underlain limestone and anhydrite units. <br/>The kick off point (KOP) for the curve and a preliminary target for the curve landing were calculated using the depth of the BLS. An estimated isopach thickness of 1,784’ from the BLS to the expected Three Forks target provided a preliminary target of 10,217’ TVD and the planned curve radius of 477’ provided a KOP of 9,740’. The calculations were based on landing the curve at the target center. <br/>Mission Canyon 8,604’MD 8,603’ TVD -6,697’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon Formation was seen at 8,604’ MD. Its depth was established due to gamma data from the MWD tool. Subtle changes in lithology and drilling signatures were also useful in establishing the depth of the Mission Canyon. ROP in the formation averaged 48fph while formation gas averaged 113 units. Near the top of the formation, samples were less carbonaceous and signiﬁcantly more anhydritic than underlying stratum. The rate of penetration was noticeably slower in the anhydrite units. Off-set wells showed indications of a more porous interval with signiﬁcant increases in formation gas. Near 8,800’ MD formation gas increase to 150 units and grain content was relatively high. Samples showed subtle changes in clay and carbon content several times before reaching the top of the Lodgepole <br/>Formation. Lodgepole 9,213 ’MD 9,212’ TVD -7,306’ SS <br/>The depth of the Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a MD of 9,213’. As the Lodgepole was encountered, a lithology change from a brown carbonaceous limestone to a predominantly gray crystalline and argillaceous limestone was identiﬁed. The most distinctive change was ratty drilling signatures from leaving the clastic Mission Canyon limestone and entering the more crystalline Lodgepole dolomitic limestone. It was not only ROP and gamma that deﬁned the formation but also differential pressure, rotary, torque and weight on bit. Drill rates through the formation in the vertical segment averaged 46fph while gas remained relatively invariable at 104 units. Samples often had spotty to patchy yellow green ﬂuorescence with slow blooming to streaming cuts. KOP was reached at 12:00 pm CDT on October 21, 2014 at a measured depth of 9,730’. </p>

Drilling resumed at 9,730’ MD at 2:00 am CDT on October 21, 2014. This assembly was used for the remainder of the curve and averaged 46fph. The lower Lodgepole was found to be more argillaceous, silty, and carbonaceous than the overlying Lodgepole. The best oil shows were also in the lower Lodgepole. During the curve, formation gas within the Lodgepole was near 95 units before encountering a more carbonaceous stratum near the False Bakken where gas average 450 units and reached a high of 1999 units. <br/>The depths of Lodgepole and Bakken gamma ray markers were utilized for isopaching the Second Bench Three Forks curve landing target. The calculations were based on landing the curve approximately 79’ into the Three Forks Formation at the target center. Four off-set wells, Howo 5-334TFH, Holst 2-33MLH, Jeriyote 4-32-5TFH and Jericho 2 were used for isopaching the curve landing target. Howo 5-33-4TFH was the primary off-set well since it was drilled on the same pad and landed the curve near the same azimuth. Only Jericho 2 drilled to the Second Bench Three Forks target so its depths lower in the Three Forks were important in estimating the target center. The well showed a 59’ isopach thickness from a marker in the First Bench to the ideal Second Bench target. This 59’ was added to the First Bench marker of the closest off-set wells which did not reach the Second Bench. This strategy was seen as the most reliable for estimating the ideal Three Forks target. Due to the curve landing near the </p>

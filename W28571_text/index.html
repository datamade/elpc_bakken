As we approached our intermediate casing point and start of lateral, we experienced tremendous well problems including the loss of a BHA, days of ﬁshing, a plug back and re—lrick off, stuck pipe, etc. Our wellbore was in a continual state of instability, and we were constantly having to revamp our plan and do our best to simply not lose the well. Fortunately, we were ultimately able to get back on track, save the well, TD and run our intermediate casing. However, unfortunately while scrambling to avoid losing the well, we did not run the open hole electric logs before running our intermediate casing and cementing it. We had kept in touch with Scott Dihle of the Nch, informing him of this situation, and have been advised by him to submit this sundry. All that noted, we did consistently take gamma ray log 5 with our MWD and have them for virtually the entire hole. Additionally, we did a cement bond log with gamma, as well as a caliper log, for the intermediate casing string and have sent both to Scott. We apologize for not running the open hole logs as expected and would greatly appreciate your understand in this matter. We should have had bet:er communication between us, our consultants and our contractors and will take heed to be more diligent in the <br/>future. In our defense, we were battling severe well issues in a very challenging well situation. Thank you for your time, and please feel free to contact me if needed. <br/>                                                    <br/>                 <br/>Company Telephone Number Rolf 0 eratin Com - n , LLc 713 658-1038 FOR STATE USE ONLY Address <br/>600 Travis Street, Suite 7070 <br/>City Housto , <br/>:3 in N a.

A Pason total gas detector with chromatograph was interfaced with the Pason EDR (Electronic Data Recorder) system. The EDR provided depth, penetration rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detection equipment which then output total gas data to the Pason EDR for viewing around location. Lagged samples for the Osterberg #2—16 H-1 Vertical Hole and Lateral #1 were caught and examined under a binocular microscope wet and dry with both direct and transmitted light and dry hydrocarbon cuts were examined with a UV fluoroscope using trichloroethylene as the solvent. These sample cuttings were used to determine the stratigraphic and structural position of the Middle Bakken Target along with ROP, limestone percentages, stain, cut and gas data. Two sets of cuttings were archived and one set was sent to the North Dakota Core Library on Roff Operating’s behalf, with the other set being sent to Roff Operating Co. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Upon sample examination, the Middle Bakken Target was evaluated as predominately a argillaceous Dolomitic sand having approximately 6 to 8% primarily intergranular porosity. This trace to occasional intercrystalline porosity was coupled with trace to rare light brown oil staining as seen in Figure 3 below. Hydrocarbon cuts were a slow to moderately fast white streaming cut becoming a slow to moderately fast white diffuse out No residual ring cuts were observed under the UV fluoroscope, using <br/>trichloroethylene as solvent. <br/>ROP: Penetration rates of 90 to 175’lhour while rotating were common and averaged 132'lhour; sliding penetration rates ranged 25 to 65’/hour. These ROP values indicate a moderately well to poorly cemented reservoir with a 6 to 8% intercrystalline porosity Middle Bakken Target, requiring hydraulic fracturing to realize optimal economic recoveries. <br/>Fluid losses: Osterberg #2-16 H1, Sidetrack #1 exhibited 175 barrels (approximated) of recordable losses over the 3602’ Sidetrack #1 wellbore. This lower level of losses could indicate both mediocre permeability and a lack of communication (depletion) with other wells in the field. </p>

Sidetrack #1 exhibited an overall O.54° updip over the entire wellbore from landing to TD. </p>

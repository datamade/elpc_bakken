Dn'll resumed with the bit coming down and back into the target zone at 10,235’ MD, leveling off brieﬂy in the hot marker before dropping below it at 10,565’ MD. The bit remained in target zone until a gamma increase at 10,280’ MD indicated a change in dip and the bit went out the top of target The bit was brought down and after coming into target at 11,500’ MD showed an 88.7° dip. Adjustments were made based on this but as the bit came down a gamma increase showed the Internal 1 shale and that the zone had suddenly ﬂattened aﬁer this hard dip. The bit entered the Internal 1 at 11,765’ MD and came back into the target at 11,900’ MD. At the end of this section the bit was in the middle of the bottom clean streak and leveled off close to dip. <br/>This section showed low gas and oil shows starting out but showed a signiﬁcant increase as the bit came into target zone. Refer to chart below to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  </p>

As drilling progressed the bit traversed through section while staying in the target zone until slightly scraping the Internal 1 from 13,990’ to 14,235’ MD. Drilling continued with the bit maintaining a ﬂatter tIend until reaching the end of this section in the middle of the target zone. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">This section showed similar gas and oil shows as the previous section until approximately 12,725’ MD where gas and oil increased dramatically and the gas buster was turned on. At this point there were periods of erratic drill rates and differential pressure. In addition, there were some slight gamma clean ups that weren’t seen before. Although there is no way to say for sure, this combination of factors points toward the possibility of the wellbore passing through a fractured area of the zone, resulting in the release of trapped gas and oil. The trip at 10,112’ MD produced 3,998 units of trip gas with a 3—5’ ﬂare and a light oil coverage at </p>

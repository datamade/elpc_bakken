Random numbers are to be determined by ASTM 03665 Section 5.1 through 5.7. The sampling must be stratified to eliminate the possibility of sample points being "clustered". Stratification is done by dividing the total quantity for the applicable bid item by the sample frequency. This process divides the total project quantity of one lot into sublots. The random number is used to obtain a random sampling point within each sublot. <br/>Key to symbols used in table: <br/>HT: Sampling and testing by holder's personnel identified by name on the approved holder‘s Q/C plan.

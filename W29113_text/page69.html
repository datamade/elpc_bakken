Fly ash and Omnisource drying pellets were applied to the remaining contents of the pit and mechanically mixed to ensure proper solidification. Glean ﬁll material may be homogeneously mixed to achieve adequate solidification. Upon solidiﬁcation, existing pit liner was cut from the surface of the pad and buried within the excavation. At least four feet of fill material was backfilled in this excavation; onsite spoil pile will provide necessary overburden. Backfilled material was tracked with equipment to ensure compaction and reduce potential for settling. The site was reclaimed back to the necessary operational surfaces and was re-seeded. <br/>E] Temporarily Abandon E] Rec|amauon Z] Other Cuttings Pit Closure <br/>    <br/>        <br/>         <br/>24-HOUR PRODUCTION RATE <br/>  <br/>        <br/>    <br/>     <br/>Surface Owners: <br/>USFA Forest Service, Dakota Prairie Grasslands 1200 Missouri Ave <br/>Bismarck, ND 58504 <br/>  <br/>   <br/>        <br/>Company Telephone Number (281)  Address <br/>Hou - on TX 77060 <br/> Printed Name <br/>A A Sarah Kin - <br/>Title .

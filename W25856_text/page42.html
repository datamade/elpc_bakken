    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The inclination continued to build while rotating, causing the need to slide down several times. The decision was made to decrease the inclination and increase in TVD. The new TVD target was decreased by 17ﬁ. This was to follow an unexpected steep downward dip of near 89.4 degrees, starting near a measured depth of 16,500ﬁ. The ROP remained near 400-450ft/hr while rotating. While venting through the gas buster, a 2-4ﬁ <br/>ﬂare was produced. <br/>The target TVD was raised 10 feet, to 10,930ﬁ TVD after a measured depth of 18,500ft. This was due to the formational dip leveling off to near 90 degrees. Drilling continued until a measured depth of 19,879ﬁ when the ROP drastically decreased, and then stopped drilling. The decision was made to trip out due to a possible motor failure. Upon tripping out of the hole, it was discovered that the mudmotor had failed and separated. A new bit, 4 %” mudmotor, and MWD were tripped in the hole. Aﬁer getting back on bottom, the oil and gas were circulated out. This yielded a trip gas of 9,959 units, and a 50ft ﬂare. <br/>Drilling continued within the lateral with the new BHA. The ROP was near 250300ﬁ per hour. The inclination was building while rotating, and the azimuth was walking to the right. This caused the need for several slides to correct this. The background gas was near 1,200 units, and a 3-5ﬁ ﬂare was seen while venting through the gas buster. While drilling, the ROP decreased and the differential pressure started to spike. The ROP continued to decrease, then stopped drilling. The decision was made to trip out of the hole at a measured depth of 21,219ﬁ due to a mudmotor failure. The mudmotor was replaced, then tripped in the hole. After getting back on bottom, the oil and gas were circulated out. This yielded a trip gas of 5,443 units, and a 30ft ﬂare. Drilling resumed with the new mudmotor. The ROP was near 240ft/hr. <br/>Drilling continued to a measured depth of 22,195ft. This was called total depth, due to hard line restrictions. Total depth for the lateral was reached at 12:40 am CT, March 11, 2015. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Target inclination was purposely set higher than latest formation dip in order to allow well to move up in formation and back into the geologic zone of interest. Samples continued to be of very poor quality making conﬁrming well’s position in zone difﬁcult. <br/>Over the next 1,000’ MD gamma continued to average 1 10 — 130 API, indicating wellbore was still below the geologic zone of interest, even though well was at the top of the target window. It was estimated that formation dip was averaging 90.5 — 90.6 degrees. In order to get back in the geologic zone of interest targets would again need to be raised, but were not due to a few uncertainties. Correlation conﬁdence was not high and up to this point the formation dip was extremely different than originally anticipated, even though there was very good well control in the area. The decision was made to hold target and continue to gather more data before continuing to make adjustments. <br/>Drilling past 19,500’ MD, wellbore remained near the center of the target window when gamma began to cool to 50 — 70 API. This conﬁrmed wellbore was back in the lower portion of the geologic zone of interest. Latest correlations showed formation dip has ﬂattened slightly and was estimated at 90.4 — 90.5 degrees. The decision was made to adjust target inclination from 90.7 to 90.4 degrees. Samples were of little help as the quality of the samples continued to be poor. Samples showed a light brown to light blue gray dolomite, consistent with samples from the lower portion of the geologic zone of interest. The use of Enviro-Torq used to minimize torque and anti-foam agents altered any potential shows. Penetration rates averaged 150 — 200 ft/hr with total gas averaging 400 A 700 units. <br/>Continuing to drill past 20,200’ MD wellbore was at the top of the target window and was estimated to be at the top of the geologic zone of interest. This conﬁrmed target was close to begin centered in the geologic zone of interest. Short term dip showed formation had continued to ﬂatten and was now 90.1 a 90.2 degrees. Over the last 300’ of the lateral wellbore continued to move up in the target window and then back down through the window. Gamma correlations were poor suggesting a formation dip of 90.25 degrees. Penetration rates continued to average 130 — 190 ft/hr and total gas averaged 300 — 700 units. Wellbore continued down to the bottom of the target window over the last few hundred feet of the lateral, ﬁnishing approximately 2’ below the bottom of target window. Total depth of the Three Forks lateral was reached at 21,183’ MD on January 215‘, 2015 at 10:10 am CST. A projection to bit showed wellbore ﬁnished 1’ below center of the geologic zone of interest. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The SC—Norma-154-98-0706H-6 was drilled as a North Three Forks lateral in the Truax Field. As the structure map indicated and past wells in the area had shown, the formation dip was expected to start mostly ﬂat before eventually up dipping. Overall average dip was expected to be 90.27 degrees for the entire lateral. Gamma markers over the ﬁrst few thousand feet indicated formation dip was slightly variable but mostly averaging 90.0 degrees. Over the next few thousand feet well formation dip changed from toe—down to toe-up making targeting extremely difﬁcult. Continuing through the middle portion of the well the Basal Clean marker was contacted several times, conﬁrming well’s position in zone. Persistent and signiﬁcantly steeper dips continued to make targeting difﬁcult. Over the last few thousand feet of the lateral, targets were raised several times and inclination changed from 90.2 to 90.7degrees before ﬁnishing at 90.4 degrees. Gamma continued to suggest wellbore was high in zone and correlations suggested an approximate dip of target formation to be 90.2 degrees. </p>

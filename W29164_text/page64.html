    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">averaging 290 — 330 ft/hr. Gamma averaged 1 10 — 130’s API and total gas continued to average 200 — 400 units. <br/>Drilling past 15,000” MD, wellbore continued to gradually work its ways back up in formation and to the base of the Basal Clean marker. A hard steak was encountered at the bottom of the target window. This resulted in multiple slides being needed as wellbore was still at the very bottom of the geologic zone of interest. While drilling past 15,500’ MD wellbore was reestablished in the target window, but was still below the geologic zone of interest. Latest correlations showed dip was unexpectedly steeper and short term dips were estimated at 90.4 — 90.6 degrees. In order to continue moving up in formation, target was raised 3’ TVD with inclination remaining 90.0 degrees as these steep dips were not expected to last. <br/>Drilling further ahead past 16,000’ MD well continued to move up towards that center of the target window. During this time correlation quality slightly decreased, but continued to suggest wellbore was still at the bottom of the geologic zone of interest. Samples were of little help, typically showing a light brown to light gray brown pyritic Dolomite. Penetration rates continued to average 290 — 330 ft/hr and gamma gradually cooled and began averaging 70 — 50’s API. This conﬁrmed wellbore was back in the bottom of the Basal Clean gamma and geologic zone of interest. Target was raised another 3’ TVD in an attempt to get above the Basal Clean marker. Inclination was kept at 90.0 as latest dips showed formation had ﬂattened and were averaging 90.2 — 90.3 degrees. <br/>After drilling past 16,500’ MD it was determined that formation dip once again increased. Correlations showed formation dip had resumed averaging 90.4 — 90.6 degrees, again steeper than originally anticipated. Penetration rates had slowly decreased and gamma continued to average 50 -70’s API conﬁrming well was still in the Basal Clean in the lower half of the geologic zone of interest. The decision was made to raise that to 5’ TVD and inclination was set at 90.2 degrees. Drilling ahead wellbore inclination was held above 90.2 degrees in order to continue moving up in formation. Samples began to transition from light tan to light blue gray Dolomite as gamma began to warm back up to around 110’s API. This suggested wellbore was now above the top of the Basal Clean marker. Correlations conﬁrmed and formation dip was now estimated at 90.1 — 90.2 degrees. <br/>Drilling past 17,000’ MD, wellbore had gradually moved up and was now at the top of the target window. It was at this point correlations became difﬁcult, as gamma once again cooled and began averaging 50 — 70’s API. This suggested formation had not ﬂattened and that clip was still steeper than originally anticipated. Formation dip was recalculated and now showed dip had been averaging 90.4 — 90.6 degrees over the last 1,500 — 1,800’ MD. This was signiﬁcantly steeper than the expected dip of 90.27 degrees for this portion of the well. Revised correlations now showed well was in the center of the geologic zone of interest, but was at the top of the target window. Target was once again raised 3’ TVD with inclination set at 90.2 degrees. During this time samples were of little help in conﬁrming wellbore’s position in zone. As they only made very minor color changes, in addition to begin of poor quality due to the use of EnviroTorq used to minimize torque and anti-foam agents. <br/>Continuing to drill past 18,000’ MD with wellbore in the middle of the target window, gamma began to warm up and began averaging 1 10 — 130 API. This suggested well was again out the bottom of the geologic zone of interest. Correlations were still somewhat difﬁcult, but showed formation dip was still averaging 90.4 — 90.65 degrees. It was at this time the entire lateral was reevaluated due to formation dip consistently being 0.2 — 0.5 degrees above anticipated dip. This resulted in a need to adjust target inclination from 90.2 to 90.7 degrees. </p>

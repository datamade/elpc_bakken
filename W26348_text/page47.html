The purpose and need for this proposal is to allow Whiting to develop their private and federally leased mineral rights through the development of this well. <br/>The well is the Demores Federal 21-11PH. This well is located within the NE% of the NW% of Section 11, T141N, R102W, Billings County, North Dakota (See Fig.’s l & 2). The well proposal includes an access road, production facilities, production ﬂowline, and an electric line. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The well pad would be 400 feet by 400 feet in size. The proposed access road, National Forest System Road (NF SR) #7261-l, of approximately 100 feet in length, would be constructed to access the well site and would be located within the NV: of Section 1 1. Existing road, NFSR #7261 , would need to be rerouted for approximately 234 feet around the east side of the proposed well pad. Total disturbance for the well pad and access road would be approximately 4.0 acres (See Fig. 2). <br/>A proposed electric line would leave the well pad and parallel the west side of the proposed access road for approximately 100 feet south to the tie in point north of NFSR #726. A proposed gas pipeline would leave the well pad and parallel the west side of the proposed access road for approximately 100 feet south to its tie in point. <br/>The Management Area for this well is 3.5 lb “Bighorn Sheep Habitat with Non-Federal Mineral Ownership”. This Management Area’s intent is to minimize impacts to Bighorn Sheep and their <br/>habitat, while allowing for development of federal and non-federal mineral ownership. Standards and Guidelines for MA 3.51b include: <br/>0 Allow oil and gas leasing with surface occupancy using CSU and TL stipulations, as necessary, to prevent signiﬁcant adverse impact to bighom sheep. Subsequent surface operations may be modiﬁed or moved to minimize the additional impacts on bighom sheep habitat. <br/>0 Honor all valid existing rights </p>

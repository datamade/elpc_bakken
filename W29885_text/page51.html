Casing shoe was set at 10,351 ’ MD. <br/>Lateral 10,3 70’ — 18,308’ MD <br/>Drilling in the lateral section commenced with expected dip coming out of the shoe of 89.4 degrees. We drilled ahead, using the clean gamma of the “B” facies as a marker. We TOOH almost immediately aﬁer beginning the lateral due to motor failure. We got back to bottom and the pipe got stuck. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">We TOOH and went in with a mill bit and began milling. We TOOH to pick up new mill bits three times. We then went in the hole with a magnet to pick up all the contents of milling. We then went back in with a new BHA and began drilling the lateral again. <br/>Dip then became ﬂatter and ran between 89.4 and 89.55 from 11,250’ MD to TD. TD was reached at 9:00 pm CST on Feb. 17. ROP averaged .33 min/ft throughout the lateral, with gas averaging 209 units. Samples collected throughout the lateral were mostly dolomite. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The Oddie 44-7-2H reached a total measured depth of 18,308’ MD on February 17, 2015. The well is preparing to run liner currently. <br/>Alex Cline Wellsite Mudlogger </p>

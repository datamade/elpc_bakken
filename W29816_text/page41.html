The surface location for the well is located 525‘ FSL and 420‘ FEL in Section 7 T154N R98W. The well was drilled from south to north ﬁnishing at approximately 362.04” FNL and 1,241.12’ FEL, in Section 6 T154N and R98W of Williams County. Kelly bushing elevation was estimated at 2,436‘.This well was drilled using an invert (oil based) mud system during the straight hole and build portion and salt water throughout the lateral. Jared Bryl and Thomas Osadchuk of Neset Consulting Service Inc. provided wellsite mudlogging services beginning at a depth of 8,800’ MD through the end of the Middle Bakken lateral which reached a total measured depth of 20,952’ MD on January 29, 2015 at 8:45 am CST. <br/>Vertical Wellbore and Curve 8,800’ — 11,630’ MD <br/>Wellsite geological services began at a depth of 8,800’ MD at 10:21 pm CST on December 30, 2014. A NOV Penless drilling recorder was used for rate ofpenetration and depth. A M9 Mudlogging Instrument was used for reading total gas and C1 through C4. Thirty foot lagged samples were caught through the end of the curve. </p>

    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Logging was started just above the expected top of the Kibbey Lime with samples showing reddish brown Sandstone. A slight change in the consistency of samples and drill rates occurred around 8,845‘ MD. Top of the Kibbey Lime was estimated to be at 8,843' TVD, based off changes in drill rates and samples. Even though top was 32 feet high of original prognosis, no changes to landing target were made at that time. Drill rates averaged 40 — 160 ft/hr, with total gas remaining fairly low at around 10 - 30 <br/>units. <br/>Charles Salts 9,001 ’ MD 8,999’ T VD -6,563 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Charles was reached at approximately 8,999' TVD as drill rates nearly doubled to 75 — 190 ft/hr and salt was observed in the samples. Top of salts was 31’ high of original depth on the prognosis. Again, no changes to landing target were made at that time. Drill rates continued to average 75 — 190 ft/hr while drilling in the salt, picking up off bottom and reaming occasionally to avoid getting stuck. An abundant amount of salt was observed in all samples with varying amounts of reddish brown sandstone. Total gas continued to average around 10 — 20 units, with increases at connections. <br/>Base ofLast Salt 9, 708’MD 9, 705' TVD -7,269’ SS <br/>While drilling through the Charles towards kickoff point, the last salt stringer was encountered from 9,659’ TVD to 9,705’ TVD, which was 2’ thinner than expected. The Base of Last Salt came in approximately 35’ higher than depth on prognosis. Even though this was signiﬁcantly higher than expected, no changes to landing target were made. Continuing to drill further down, there were no more signiﬁcant drill breaks or signs of salt. Samples transitioned to consist of dolomitic limestone, with stringers of anhydrite in limestone while drilling at 65 — 100 ft/hr with total gas averaging 10 — 30 units. <br/>Lodgepole 10,460’ MD I 0,45 7' TVD -8,021 ’ SS </p>

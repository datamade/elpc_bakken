The use ofEnViro-Torq used to minimize torque and anti-foam agents, altered any potential oil shows. ROP averaged 250 — 320 ft/hr, total gas averaged around 500 — 1,250 units with increases at connections and gamma averaged 80 — 100 API with very little ﬂuctuation. Continuing to drill ahead past 14,000’ MD wellbore gradually began to move up towards center of the target window. Wellbore continued to drift up through the target window over the next 500’ MD. This again resulted in less than correlations as gamma signature continued to average 80 — 100 API with few if any ﬂuctuations. <br/>Drilling ahead past 15,000’ MD wellbore remained in the center of the target window and was estimated to be in the lower half of the geologic zone of interest. As part of our overall lateral plan, target inclination was increased to 90.4 degrees. This was in an attempt to be proactive of expected dip change. Continuing to drill ahead correlations gradually began to suggest toe-up formation dips. This was consisted with latest seismic and structure map data. During this time wellbore was estimated to be near the center of the geologic zone of interest. This conﬁrmed current target was still good. <br/>Drilling ahead past 16,000‘ MD wellbore inclination built several times while rotating causing well to drift above center and to the top of the target window. This indicated that formation dip had likely increased and was pushing the wellbore up. Correlations were reexamined and showed slightly steeper short term dips, but long term dips were still averaging 90.4 — 90.5 degrees. This caused target to be slightly lower than ideal and the decision was made to raise target in hope of contacting the clean gamma at the top of the geologic zone of interest. Gamma signature remained unchanged making several interpretations plausible as well as conﬁrming well’s position in zone difﬁcult. <br/>Continuing to drill ahead past 17,000’ MD wellbore had reached the top of the target window resulting in the need for several slides in order to reduce wellbore inclination. Correlations were still of low conﬁdence, due to lack of contact with the clean gamma marker, but clip was estimated to be 90.5 — 90.6 degrees. Samples continued to change very little, consisting of a gray to light gray dolomitic siltstone, a typical for indicating well was in the geologic zone of interest. The use of Enviro-Torq used to minimize torque and anti—foam agents, altered any potential oil shows and greatly reduce sample quality. ROP averaged 250 — 320 ft/hr, total gas averaged around 500 - 1,250 units with increases at connections. Gamma continued to somewhat uncharacteristic for a Middle Bakken well averaging 80 — 100 API with very little ﬂuctuation. Over the next few hundred feet wellbore inclination naturally decreased resulting in the need to slide up to stay in target window. <br/>Drilling past 17,500” MD inclination had gradually increased with well slowly moving up towards center of the target window. Over the next 200’ MD inclination unexpectedly increased to over 92 degrees. At the same time, as wellbore got just over 1’ TVD above the center of target window the clean gamma marker was contacted. This resulted in a signiﬁcant reevaluation of latest correlations. New interpretations showed formation dip had changed from 90.6 degrees to 89.5 degrees and at point of contact was to 90.0 degrees, all over the span of 600 — 800’ MD. An immediate target change was made as current one was no longer accurate. Continuing to drill ahead while decreasing inclination, correlations conﬁrmed well was above the top of the geologic zone of interest and was estimated to be within 8 — 5 ’ TVD of the Upper Shale. There were no noticeable changes in samples to conﬁrm or deny wellbore’s position in zone. Perpetration rates continued to average 250 — 300 ft/hr with total gas averaging 300 — 900 units with increases at connections. <br/>Continuing to drill ahead past 18,200” MD wellbore had been ﬂattened off and was just starting to move down in formation. Correlations during this time were somewhat anomalous, but it was determined formation was now slightly toe-down. As wellbore was continuing to make its down, gamma ﬂuctuated very brieﬂy. It was later determined to be the clean gamma marker even though the signature was signiﬁcantly different then what had previously been seen. Continuing to drill past 18,700’ MD wellbore inclination was still below 90 degrees, allowing well to move down in formation and back into the geologic zone of interest. Gamma signature continued to be very uncharacteristic averaging 100 — 120 API, making correlations extremely difﬁcult. Based off multiple interpretations it was determined formation was once again toe-up. Formation dips were estimated to be 90.2 — 90.4 degrees, suggesting </p>

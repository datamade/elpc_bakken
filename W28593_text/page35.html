The total gas volume that is unable to be sold through the gas gathering pipeline will be ﬂared through engineered ﬂare system so that optimal combustion can occur and gas sent to ﬂare will be metered using oriﬁce plates <br/>a.

Sum all the individual well Theoretical Monthly Gas Production volumes to determine the " otal Theoretical Monthly Gas Production" for the central production facility. <br/>7. Calculate a sales factor by dividing the total Actual Monthly Gas Sales by the Total Theoretical Monthly Gas Production volumes for the central production facility corrected as necessary for any time wells were producing but measurement was not operational <br/>8. Calculate a ﬂare factor by dividing the total Actual Monthly Gas Flared by the Total Theoretical Monthly Gas Production volumes for the Central production facility corrected as necessary for any time wells were producing but measurement was not operational. <br/>9. Determine “Allocated Monthly Gas Sales" for each well by multiplying the respective individual well Theoretical Monthly Gas Production volume by the sales factor calculated in Step 7 above. <br/>10. Determine "Allocated Monthly Gas Flared" for each well by multiplying the respective individual well Theoretical Monthly Gas Production volume by the ﬂare factor calculated in Step 8 above. <br/>11. Gas Sales/ Flare meters used in the measurement will be calibrated and maintained according to gas gathering contracts with commercial gathering entities and /or industry standard practices if performed by Zavanna, LLC directly. <br/>12. Well gas allocation meters will be checked and calibrated on a standard timespan reﬂective of gas volume magnitude (large volumes quarterly, lower volumes every 6 months). <br/>13. Volumes will be reported to appropriate agencies through routine gas production reports ﬁled monthly. <br/>Associated Oil Tank Gas (aka Vapors) Recovered and Sold with Separator Gas: <br/>1. Commingled gas from the discharge of Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU) compressors will be measured either through the Gas Sales meter or the Gas Flare meter and will be allocated back to the well as described in Steps 9 and 10 from the previous section. The use of sales and ﬂare factors will bridge the gap between Theoretical Gas Production and Actual Gas Production. Liquids (aka condensates) recovered from the VRU compressor will go to the tanks and quantities allocated by the method described in Step 6 from the Oil Continuous Metering section of these procedures. <br/>  </p>

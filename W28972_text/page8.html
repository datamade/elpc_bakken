The target true vertical depth was 9,162 feet. Gamma correlations were done with the Thorson 4H oﬂ‘set log. Initial gamma correlations indicated the target line was coming in 4 feet high to 5 feet low to the target set at a true vertical depth of 9240 feet. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 9,189’MD 9,117' TVD -6,772’SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was encountered at a measured depth of 9,189 feet, a true vertical depth of 9,1 17 feet and sub—sea of -6,772 feet, 2 feet low to prognosis. Samples at that time were described as a black, hard, blocky, extremely carbonaceous, shale, A maximum background gas reading of 264 units was recorded while drilling within the shale <br/>The gamma correlation done at the top of the Upper Bakken Shale indicated the target zone was coming in one foot high to the target true vertical depth of 9,240 feet. No target changes were made. <br/>Middle Bakken 9,213’ 1WD 9,132’ TVD -6, 787’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 9,213 feet, a true vertical depth of9, 132 feet and sub-sea of -6,787 feet, 3 feet low to prognosis. Samples at that time were described as a tan gray to light gray, ﬁrm, calcareous, argillaceous, siltstone. This rock exhibited poor intergranular porosity, and instant broad streaming, instant fair cloudy cuts. While drilling within the Middle Bakken background gas ranged between 90 to 220 units. <br/>The gamma correlation done at the top of the Middle Bakken indicated the target zone was coming in 3 feet low at a true vertical depth of 9,243 feet. No target changes were made at that time. </p>

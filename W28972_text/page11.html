    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Dip calculations ranged between 89.3 to 89.45 degrees. To avoid moving up in section it was decided to decrease the target inclination from 89.5 to 89.4 degrees at a measured depth of 15,200 feet, with a target true vertical depth of 9,306 feet. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">At a measured depth of 16,470 feet gamma increased over 100 api, indicating the hot gamma stringer new the mid-point of the target window. Gamma correlations indicated an extremely steep dip of 88.7 degrees. At that time the bit was approximately 5 feet low to the target line. In order to keep from moving too high in section the target true vertical depth was shifted down 5 feet to a true vertical depth of 9,324 feet and the inclination was decreased to 89.3 degrees. <br/>While drilling ahead samples were described as a cream, sandy, pyritic dolomite. This rock exhibited fair intercrystalline porosity as well as slow fair streaming, fair cloudy cuts. Spotty brown oil staining could also be seen. Varying percentages of shale and siltstone were also noted in most samples. Background gas ranged, between 300 to 560 units. <br/>At a measured depth of 17,361 feet it was decided to trip out of the hole due to differential spiking. Once back on bottom a trip gas of 1162 units was recorded while circulating through the gas buster. A 5 to 8 foot ﬂare was also seen at that time. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Gamma increased over 100 api at a measured depth of 17,770 feet and continued to climb to 140 api indicating the deﬁnitive hot gamma marker at the base of the zone. It was decided this was a good marker to have within the target window, but to avoid the line moving any deeper structurally the inclination was shallowed to 89.5 degrees at a measured depth of 17,800 feet. The total depth of the lateral was reached at a measured depth of 19,045 feet at approximately 4:00 am central stande time. It is estimated the bit was approximately 17 feet below the base of the Lower Bakken Shale. <br/>Conclusion </p>

Thorson 159-94-7A-18-1HS was TD’d at measured depth of 19,045 feet on November 4, 2014 at 4:00 am central standard time. The bottom hole location was projected to 19,045 feet measured depth, 9,346.34 feet true vertical depth, 89.2 degree inclination, 178.2 degree azimuth, at a vertical section of 10,007.58 feet.

Gamma also spiked, reaching as high as 626 API. Background gas ranged from 146 to 337 units, averaging 238 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.50 to 1.13 minutes per foot, averaging 0.66 minutes per foot. The upper Bakken was described as black carbonaceous shale with no visible porosity and a bright fast streaming cut. <br/>[Middle Bakken 10,168’ MD 1 0, 06 7’ T VD -7,832 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Middle Bakken was picked at a decrease in rate of penetration and gamma. The first sample caught in the Middle Bakken was described as cream gray dolomite with fair to good porosity. Samples transitioned to a medium gray sandstone with poor porosity and a cloudy green fair streaming cut. Rate of penetration in the Middle Bakken ranged from 0.63 to 2.07 minutes per foot, averaging 0.95 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 174 to 337 units, averaging 266 units. Gamma ranged from 61 to 136 API, averaging 86 API. <br/>Lower Bakken 10,300 ’ MD 1 0, 120 ’ TVD - 7, 885 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Lower Bakken Shale was picked at an increase in rate of penetration and gamma. Sample changed from sandstone to black shale. Gamma peaked at 875 API and averaged 649 API. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.47 to 1.73 minutes per foot and averaged 0.64 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 163 to 505 units and averaged 309 units. <br/>Three Forks 10,411 ’ MD 10,145’ TVD -7,910’ SS <br/>The top of the Three Forks was picked at a decrease in rate of penetration and gamma, as well as a change in sample from black shale to medium gray siltstone. Rate of penetration in the Three Forks while drilling the curve ranged from 0. 73 to 1.87 minutes per foot and averaged 0.96 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 185 to 427 units and averaged 274 units. Gamma ranged ﬁ'om 62 to 155 API and averaged 89 API. Samples were described as gray tan sandstone with fair to poor porosity. Intermediate casing point was reached at 10,500’ measured depth on December 1, 2014 at 5:45 am. <br/>Lateral 10,500’ — 19,508’ <br/>After intermediate 7” casing was successfully ran and set to 10,479’ measured depth, drilling began in the lateral at 4:30 am on January 24, 2015. No notable trip gas was detected. The top of the 9’ target window is set 11’ below the base of the lower Bakken shale. There is a clean gamma contact 2’below the top of the target window, used as the set line for the window. <br/>The curve was landed high at approximately 85 degrees. The wellbore was allowed to drop in order to encounter the clean gamma contact. At 11,300’ the wellbore deﬂected up off the set line, which is typical. After several slides were put in the wellbore dropped below the set line into the clean gamma at 12,060’. At this time the </p>

The Mission Canyon came in 5’ high to prognosis. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.40 to 2.23 minutes per foot and averaged 1.34 minutes per foot. Samples from the upper Mission Canyon were majority cream gray limestone, Samples transitioned to cream tan dolomite in the last half of the Mission Canyon. Average porosity through the Mission Canyon was fair. Total gas ranged from 112 to 202 units and averaged 147 units. <br/>Lodgepole 9, 420’ MD 9,41 7’ T VD -7,182’ SS <br/>The top of the Lodgepole was picked using gamma markers found on offset logs. The Lodgepole came in 15’ high to prognosis. Drill rates in the Lodgepole to kick off point ranged from 1.10 to 2.82 minutes per foot, and averaged 1.64 minutes per foot. Samples in the upper Lodgepole were generally light gray limestone with overall poor porosity. Total gas ranged from 129 to 219 units and averaged 138 units. Kick off point of 9,718’ was reached at 1:00am on November 30, 2014. </p>

The landing target was to be 11’ into the Three Forks formation, initially set at 10,187’ TVD. Once back on bottom trip gas spiked to 219 units. Drilling rates in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged from 0.50 to 4.97 minutes per foot, averaging 0.81 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 123 to 219 units, averaging 141 units. Samples in the lower Lodgepole were majority light gray to tan gray limestone with overall poor to fair porosity. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the curve to correlate to the Bergstrom 11-13TFH and G Bergstrom 31-13H wells, which are located on the same pad. <br/>False Bakken 10,111’MD 10,037’ TVD -7,802’SS Scallion 1 0,118 ’ MD 10, 041 ’ TVD - 7,806 ’ SS Upper Bakken Shale 1 0, 134 ’ MD 1 0, 050 ’ TVD - 7,815 ’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was encountered 7’ high to prognosis, the Scallion was 8’ high and the upper Bakken shale came in 7’ high.

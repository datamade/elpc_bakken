    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation’s G Bergstrom 41-13TFH is located in the NWNE of Section 13 T156N R97W in Williams County, North Dakota, drilled as a multi well pad with the Kaldahl 44-12TFH, Kaldahl 34—12TFH, and G Bergstrom 31-13TFH lateral wells. The G Bergstrom 41—13TFH is a horizontal well with the two mile lateral across sections 13 and 24, targeting the Three Forks. The G Bergstrom 41-13TFH was spudded November 23, 2014 at 2:30 am. The well reached total measured depth of 19147’ at 10 pm on January 18 due to reaching the southern section hardline. Bottom hole location is in the SESE of Section 24 T156N R97W; 242.25’ FSL & 1284.29’ FEL. Wellsite geological services were provided by Jessica Stark, Matt McHugh, and Jennifer Meidinger of Neset Consulting Service. A Total Gas Detection system was utilized for gas analysis. Samples were caught every thirty feet throughout the vertical and curve and every ﬁﬁy feet throughout the lateral, as well as intermediate samples when necessary. One set of samples was washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 7,140’ —— 9, 718’ MB <br/>Logging services began at 7,140’ measured depth in the lower Amsden at 12: 15 pm on November 26‘“, 2014. <br/>Tyler 7,160’ MD 7,157’ TVD -4,922’ SS <br/>The top of the Tyler marker was picked using gamma. The Tyler came in 19’ high to the prognosis. The first sample in the Tyler was a light gray anhydrite with trace amounts of siltstone. As drilling continued the samples transitioned to a brick red fissile shale. Overall the Tyler had poor porosity and little oil shows. Total gas ranged from 140 to 202 units and averaged 156 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.23 to 1.73 minutes per foot and averaged 0.54 minutes per foot. <br/>Kibbey Lime 7, 711 ’ MD 7, 708’ TVD -5,4 73 ’ SS <br/>The Kibbey Lime was picked at a drop in gamma and the sample change from a reddish sandstone to a cream gray limestone. The Kibbey came in 5’ high to the prognosis. <br/>Charles 7,883 ’ MD 7,880’ TVD -5, 645 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Charles was picked using sample and gamma. The Charles came in 6’ low to the prognosis. Samples changed from red orange sandstone to salt. A total of three salt beds, along with beds of dolomite, anhydrite, and limestone, were encountered in the Charles formation. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.32 to 2.03 minutes per foot </p>

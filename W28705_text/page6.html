    <p class="styleSans113.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Background 0 The Castner 34-20H well is currently being drilled with H&P 471. <br/>o The well was spud on 13"I August 2014. _ <br/>- 13-1/2” surface hole was drilled to 2198 ft and 9-5/8 surface casing was run and cemented at 2188 ft with returns to surface. <br/>0 The BOP was then installed and tested on the well. <br/>0 8—3/4” intermediate hole was drilled to 10842 ft, landing the well out at near horizontal. <br/>o 7” production casing was run to a depth of 10824 ft. Once 7” production casing was at planned setting depth, it was attempted to get circulation sufﬁcient enough to cement. During this attempt, the well packed off around the 7” casing shoe and circulation was lost. Subsequently, <br/>the 7” casing was perforated from 10623 to 10626 ft (10511 ft TVD) and circulation was attempted without success. The 7” casing was further perforated from 10589 to 10592 ft <br/>(10495 ft TVD) and circulation was regained at a rate of 6 barrels per minute; a sufficient rate in order to effectively cement the 7" casing. The 7” casing was then cemented with 98.2 bbls (185 sx) of 11.4 ppg lead, 107.5 bbls (357 sx) 15.2 ppg tail #1, and 75.4 bbls (268 sx) of 15.6 ppg tail #2. Full circulation was maintained during the cement}ob with an estimated top of cements as follows: lead at 811 ft, tall #1 at 4479 ft, and tail #2 at 8494 ft. The 7’ casing was successfully pressure tested to 3500 psi. <br/>0 The 7" shoe track was drilled out and 10 ft of new formation to 10852 ft to where a Formation Integrity Test was performed to a 12.6 ppg Equivalent Mud Weight. ' <br/>- Currently, the 6” horizontal reservoir section is being drilled at 16124 ft as of 6AM Thursday, 28‘‘1 August to a planned total depth of 21012 ft. ‘ <br/>  <br/>0 While the 7" production casing was run to planned TD (221 ft into the section and 21 ft past the hard line), Marathon was unable to circulate the casing and cement it as planned. With having to perforate the casing in order to regain circulation, the casing was effectively cemented, but the cement isolation is not past the hard line. However the 7” casing provides effective cement isolation 17.6 ft inside of the section line. it is also noted that the cement isolation provides effective isolation for the Bakken Pool as it is 12 ft TVD past the top of the Bakken Pool. <br/>Plan Forward 0 Drill 6" horizontal reservoir section to planned total depth of 21012 ft. 0 Install a 4-1/2” liner with a 30 stage swell packer / frac sleeve completion. In order to effectively isolate the 7” casing shoe, and stay out with the 200 ft hard line, swell packers will be placed at 10,700 ft (124 ft inside the 7” casing shoe) and at 11,070 ft, or 246 ft in the open hole. The ﬁrst stimulated and produced section of the reservoir will be 467 it past the sectlon line or 267 ft past the hard line. It is planned to set the liner hanger and packer at 10340 ft. <br/>*lZactures/t‘iﬁnu tekweilinthefuturew‘i KL «4 0 ac (aw ‘— “V‘a f- lu...r.‘n a; “Carol? c943,)“ “9+ ACPL ‘2‘" “‘ef’ﬁh ‘ c.

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">measured depths 17,910 to 17,930 feet. Aﬁer time drilling at a rate of 1 foot per hour from 8:30 am CT to 4:00 pm CT and 13 feet per hour ﬁ'om 4:00 pm CT to 5:00 pm CT, sidetrack #1 had been established. By measured depth 19,000 feet the wellbore had reached the center of the target. Gamma data indicated the formation had turned up as expected previously. An estimated 90.3° and a 4 foot shiﬁ up was applied to the target and the wellbore was centered within the new window by measured depth 19,600 feet. <br/>The appearance of unfamiliar gamma signatures in the ﬁnal 2,000 feet were interpreted as a of a change in target angle and likely it’s vertical position too. Having also noticed the tendency of the wellbore to drop in inclination while rotating, the target was leﬁ at 907°. The effort was an attempt to coax operators into maintaining a consistent inclination until the end of the lateral. The effort became unsuccessful when at measured depth 20,300 feet, the wellbore passed out the bottom of the target zone. After one last effort to hold the assembly at a steady true vertical depth, the ﬁnal 150 feet were rotated out to total measured depth of 20,752 feet. <br/>November 1“, 2014 at 4:20 pm CT Sidetrack #1 of the Mrachek 21-26-4H was completed in under 16 days of active drilling despite a strike with the upper Bakken shale. Geology of the Mrachek 21-26—4H was consistent with adjacent laterals drilled in the recent weeks. The top of the zone is comprised of a clean, tan to translucent dolomite that becomes more sediment laden lower within the column. The darker color of the lower portion is attributed to the increasing bioturbated, detrital sediment within. Typical of the other laterals in this series, the top half of zone returned the stronger shows of gas and petroleum whenever encountered. <br/>John Nygard Wellsite Geologist </p>

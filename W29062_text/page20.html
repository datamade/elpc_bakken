Drilling times in the Lodgepole below KOP were between 5—47 minutes sliding. Gas varied between 13-363 units. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the Lodgepole to correlate to the TVD JB 11-6TFH Pilot Hole. Target was changed from 10,411’ to 10,414’ based on <br/>Lodgepole correlations. Upper Bakken Shale 1 0,225 ’ MD 1 0,208’ TVD -8,136 ’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was entered at 10,208’ TVD. Background gas was ﬁ'om 85 to 278 units in the shale. A typical sample was Shale: Black, very dark gray, carbonaceous, calcareous, pyritic, gritty, blocky, even pale yellow ﬂuorescence, instant bright green milky cut. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">At 10,244’ TVD the Middle Bakken was encountered. This top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The sample lithology of the Middle Bakken consisted of sandstone. A typical sample exhibited medium to light gray sandstone, light to medium grayish brown, with beige to oﬂiwhite inclusions, very ﬁne grained, subrounded, calcareous, limey cementation, moderate sorting, poor intergranular porosity, scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, cloudy bright yellow green cut. <br/>Lower Bakken Shale 10,332’ MD 10,292’ TVD -8,220’ SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale was entered at 10,292’ TVD. Backgron gas was from 136 to 346 units in the shale. A typical sample was Shale: Medium gray, grayish brown, trace dark gray, some mottled, carbonaceous, pyritic, gritty, blocky, even pale yellow green ﬂuorescence, instant bright cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Three Forks 10,408’ MD 10,342’ TVD -8,270’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">At 10,342’ TVD the Three Forks was entered. The top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The typical samples consisted of siltstone that was medium grayish brown, light grayish brown, trace oﬂ‘ white, arenaceous, argillaceous, dolomitic, with poor indurationi Lithology also included trace to moderate shale that was medium bluish gray, waxy, platy, blocky, with moderate induration. Samples exhibited poor intergranular porosity, light brown oil staining, even to scattered dull to pale yellow green ﬂuorescence, with generally instant bright yellow to yellow-green cuts. <br/>The curve was landed at 10,700’ MD, 10,414.23’ TVD. Casing point was reached at 10,681’ MD on September 30, 2014. </p>

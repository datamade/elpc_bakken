    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Whiting Oil and Gas IB 11-6 TFH is a grassroots well located in the NW NW of Section 6 T153N R92W in Mountrail County, North Dakota. The initial phase of the JB 11—6 TFH is a vertical and core section, with a subsequent curve landing within the second bench of the Three Forks Fm. The JB 1 1-6 TFH spudded September 14, 2014 and reached a total depth of 15,790’MD on October 06, 2014. Wellsite geological services began at 8,450 feet in the Charles Formation. Thirty and ﬁfty foot lagged samples were collected. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Logging services began at 8,450 feet measured depth in The Charles Formation. Gas detection system was recalibrated and tested before logging depth with system functioning correctly. Drill rates ranged ﬁom 1.0-3.5 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 20-40 units. <br/>Base of the Last Salt 8,61 7’ 1WD 8,8615 ’ TVD -6,243 ’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered at 8,617’ MD; -6,243’ SS. Base of the last salt was picked by the last sample with salt present. Samples then became beds of anhydrite, shale and occasional limestone, until the Mission Canyon. <br/>Mission Canyon 8, 783’ MD 8, 780’ TVD -6,408’ SS <br/>Mission Canyon was picked from lithology change and the offset log, ROP was 1.5-3 minutes a foot. Samples consisted of: Limestone: Gray, light gray, trace mottled, mudstone, dolomitic, trace argillaceous, moderate induration, trace anhydrite, white, cryptocrystalline, tight, trace dead oil staining, mineral ﬂuorescence only, slow pale yellow orange cut. Gas ranged from 20—40 units. </p>

Drill rates in the Lodgepole ranged from 1.5-2.5 minutes per foot rotating with gas ranging from 83-148 units. Typical samples were: Limestone: Light to medium gray brown, medium to dark gray, light grey in part, trace cream, off-white, microcrystalline, fair amounts of blocky chops, platy in part, <br/>moderately hard to soft, no visible porosity, no ﬂuorescence, no cut. KOP was at 9,842’ MD. </p>

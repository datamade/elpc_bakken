The wellbore was riding along with dip. Few slides were required to keep us riding with dip. The target was adjusted at 13,500’ MD to steepen up the target window to 90.39 from a 90.25 degrees. That change had raised the window. Drilling ahead continued for the rest of the <br/>day. The ROP for the day would be 92.5 ﬂ/hr. Gas would average 35 units. Samples would consist of a light gray to light brown Siltstone. <br/>October 6, 2014 14,800’ MD 10,400’ TVD <br/>The wellbore would track nicely along the dip rate of 90.39 degrees until TD. The decision was made to come up to the top of the window and above it 5-7 feet to see if there is a gas change. The ROP for the day would average ﬁ/hr. Gas would average units. Samples would be a light brown to light grayish brown Siltstone. <br/>Conclusion </p>

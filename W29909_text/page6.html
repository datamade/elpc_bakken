    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The wellbore continued to drill in the hotter gamma in the top 2’ of the target zone. The samples in the upper two feet of the target contained about 1% pyrite. Sliding succeed in bringing the wellbore down in true vertical depth and the clean gamma was encountered at 16,190’ measured depth The wellbore continued to drop in true vertical depth and the slightly warmer gamma bench located at the base of the target zone was seen at 16,3 83’ measured depth. The Aquitard was encountered at 16,388’ measured depth. The wellbore continued to drill in the Aquitard until 16,935’. Gamma ranged from 98 to 156 API and averaged 123 API in the Aquitard. The samples were generally described as a light cream tan sandstone with varying percentages of shale and siltstone <br/>and poor porosity. It is notable that we did not see any orange shale/siltstone in this interval. <br/>Sliding succeed in bringing the wellbore up in true vertical depth and entered the base of the target zone at 17,028’ measured depth. The wellbore continued to rise in true vertical depth and crossed the set line at 17,433 ’ measured depth. Between 17 ,028’ to 17,433’, the gamma ranged from 44 to 93 API and averaged 60 API. Total gas ranged from 157 to 977 units and averaged 573 units Drilling rates ranged from 0.28 to 2.93 minutes per foot and averaged 0.55 minutes per foot. The samples were generally described as a cream sandstone with fair to good porosity and varying percentages of shale and siltstone. <br/>At 17 ,433’ measured depth the set line was crossed and the hotter gamma was encountered. The wellbore remained in the top two feet of the target zone until 17,687 ’. Here the clean gamma was encountered and used to estimate the dip to be 90.23 degrees. Drilling continued in the clean gamma until about 18,087 ’ measured depth. Between 17,687 ’ to 18,087 ’ the samples were generally described as sandstone: tan cream, cream, light tan, off white, translucent, very ﬁne grain, subrounded to subangular, moderately sorted, dolomitic cement; 5% shale, light blue green; scattered siltstone; good porosity; trace pyrite, patchy dull yellow ﬂuorescence, milky yellow green cut. Gamma ranged from 42 to 88 API and averaged 54 API. Rate of penetration ranged ﬁ'om 0.27 to 2.57 minutes per foot. Total gas averaged 670 units. </p>

Here the hot gamma was encountered. This contact point used to estimate the dip to be 90.11 degrees. Between 18,087’ to 19,776’ total gas averaged 477 units. Gamma ranged from 43 to 123 API and averaged 66 API. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.20 to 7.27 minutes per foot and averaged 0.55 minutes per foot.

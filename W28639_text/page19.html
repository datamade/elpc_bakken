The three phases of Parshall 92-28H were vertical, curve, and horizontal sections, with the horizontal section targeting the IVﬁddle Bakken formation. Parshall 92-28H had a spud date of September 24, 2014, with geological logging and gas detection services beginning at 7,280’ MD in the Kibbey formation. Lagged thirty foot samples (with occasional lagged ten foot samples to determine formation tops in all sections) were collected in the vertical and curve sections, and lagged one hundred foot samples were collected in the horizontal section. All samples were washed, dried, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core and Sample Library, located on the campus of the University of North Dakota in the city of Grand Forks. EOG Resources Parshall 9228H reached TD of 15,231’ MD at 3:30 PM on October 2, 2014 in SE/SE Section 28 T152N R9OW. <br/>Vertical Section 7,280’ — 8,815 ’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 7,280’ MD in the bottom of the Kibbey formation on September 26, 2014. The gas detection system was tested before reaching logging depth to ensure that the system was functioning correctly. The logged vertical section was drilled through the Charles and Mission Canyon formations, and into the Lodgepole formation, where rate of penetration (ROP) ranged from 0.10 to 4.80 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas measurements ranged from 31 to 757 units. Kick off <br/>point (KOP) was reached within the Lodgepole formation at 10:00 AM on September 27, 2014 at 8,815’ MD. <br/>Charles 7,356 ’ MD 7,354 ’ T VD -5,401 ’ SS <br/>The Charles formation top was picked at 7,3 56’ MD/—5,401’ SS. ROP in the Charles formation ranged from 0.10 to 4.80 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas measurements ranged from 32 to 732 units. At 7,448’ MD within the Charles formation, a trip out of the hole for a new bit occurred due to poor rate of penetration at 9:15 AM on September 26, 2014, and drilling resumed at 4:45 PM on September 26, 2014. Samples generally consisted of limestone, which were light gray to light brown, slight reddish brown, cream tan gray, dark gray in part, carbonaceous to argillaceous, wackestone to packstone, with moderately poor induration, fair to good intergranular porosity, yellow green to dark gray ﬂuorescence, and a slow streaming cut. <br/>Base of the Last Salt 7, 768’ MD 7, 765’ T VD -5,812’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered within the Charles formation at 7,768’ MD/-5,812’ SS. This was picked by the last sample collected in the Charles formation </p>

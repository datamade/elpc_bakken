The third section of the horizontal was drilled to Way Point 3, set at 13,500’ MD, with a target window of 9,338 - 9,350’ TVD. The fourth and ﬁnal horizontal section of Parshall 92-28H was set to Way Point 4 at 15,146’ MD, with a target window of 9,338 — 9,350’ TVD, Within Way Point 4, the Lower Bakken Shale (LBS) was encountered at 13,962’ MD/—7,404’ SS, and sliding to <br/>get out of the LBS was eventually successful, and the Middle Bakken dolomite was again encountered at 14,121’ MD/-7,401’ SS. <br/>Lower Bakken Shale 13, 962’ [MB 9,35 7’ T VD -7,404 ’ SS Middle Bakken 14,121 ’ MD 9,354 ’ TVD -7,401 ’ SS <br/>Way Point 4 was then adjusted upward from 14,650 — 15,146’ MD, with a target window of 9,322 — 9,332’ TVD between these two points. This was done to attempt to encounter the GR Marker once again to determine formation dip, but the marker was not witnessed again before TD was reached just beyond Way Point 4, at 15,231’ MD. All Way Points were published by Tony Rios of ECG Resources. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Middle Bakken dolomite throughout the entire horizontal section was typically light bluish gray to medium bluish gray to gray, spotted very light beige brown, dark gray in part, microcrystalline, argillaceous, and minimally carbonaceous. The dolomite was also generally moderately ﬁrm, with fair to good intergranular porosity and light green to dark yellow to dark green and dark gray ﬂuorescence, with mostly fast streaming cuts. ROP in the horizontal ranged from 0.20 to 4.90 minutes per foot while rotating and sliding, and gas measurements ranged from 27 to 6,742 units, with max gas value within range observed at 14,907’ MD. <br/>Conclusion <br/>EOG Resources Parshall 92-28H reached a total depth of 15,231’ MD at 3:30 PM CST on October 2, 2014 in the Middle Bakken, and is now awaiting completion. </p>

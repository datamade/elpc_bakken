Approximately 1500 psi on the casing. Two other waits on the pad also have pressure. The pressure was noticed by the drilling rig after drilling the third well on the pad. Knowledge of exactiy where the inﬂux is coming from is unknown. Consequently they brought cement back to the surface casing on the remaining three (0, E, 8. F) and were able to Isolate the inﬂux. The 9 5/8” shoe for the A wall is at 2.227' and T00 is at 3,615'. The rlg capped the wells upon moving off location. Completion came in to pad prep the wells, bled off the pressure on the surface casing, pumped 50 bbls of brine down the casing to keep the pressure off, and nippied down the caps and installed tubing heads. <br/>24-HOUR PRODUCTION RATE <br/>              <br/>    <br/>     <br/>The next step requested to take. is to monitor the backside pressure between the 7" and 9 5! " casing, and bleed off regulariy before we free the well. We will run a free string and continue to monitor during the tree, cleanout, and ﬂowback. Once completions is finished and the walls are producing, we wilt monitor, bleed and re-evaluate the <br/>necessary steps to proceed if conditions have not changed. <br/>  <br/>   <br/>        <br/>Company Telephone Number «303» mm Address <br/>3“”  °°“ En : Iewood CO 01 ‘i 2 Sig ture . <br/>FOR STATE USE ONLY 1!

    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation, Koch #34—19PH was drilled as a single lateral well with the primary objective being in the Three Forks Formation, targeting the Pronghorn prospect. This well is located on the SWSE comer of Section 19, T140N, R99W in Stark County, North Dakota. The Koch #34—19PH was spudded on July 23", 2014 and reached a total depth of 20,320’ MD at 11:45 AM MDT on August 24‘“, 2014; twelve days from spud. Wellsite geologic services were provided by Neset Consulting Service began logging at a depth of 7,800’ MD in the Amsden Formation, at 8:00 PM MDT on August 15th, 2014. Samples were caught, cleaned and described by the mudloggers for the entirely of the well. Thirty to one hundred foot lagged samples were caught and saved to be archived at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Total Gas Ltd was used to monitor and record gas in correspondence with Rig Sense EDR. <br/>Tyler 8,164’ MD 8,163’ TVD -5,519’ SS <br/>Logging started at 7 ,800’ MD in the Amsden formation. The Tyler Formation was encountered at 8,164’ MD. The top of the formation came in 34 feet high to the prognosis. The top of the formation was deﬁned by a heat up in gamma. <br/>Kibbey Lime 8,594 ’ MD 8,593’ T VD -5,949’ SS </p>

The Kibbey Lime top came in at 8,594’ MD and was deﬁned by correlating drill rates with an offset well and later conﬁrmed by gamma. Backgron gases averaged 40 units throughout the formation. <br/>As drill rates declined the decision was made to trip out of the hole and change out the BHA at 8,612’ MD. The rig crew started tripping out of the hole at 2:00 PM MDT on August 16‘“, 2014. Aﬁer changing out the BHA and tripping back to bottom they resumed drilling the vertical at 9:00 PM MDT that evening. <br/>Charles 8, 729’ 1WD 8, 728’ T VD -6,084’ SS <br/>The top of the Charles formation was deﬁned by a gamma marker as the MWD tool crossed the top of the formation, along with a change in samples from a light to medium gray limestone, to a clear, frosty, blocky salt. The top of the Charles formation came in 29 feet high to the prognosis. The Charles consisted of interbedded layers of <br/>salt, limestone, and anhydrite. Background gas was recorded at an average of 40 units throughout the formation. </p>

Here shale samples were generally dull black to very dark gray and very <br/>dark brown, blocky, ﬁssile, carbonaceous, spotted dark yellow to dark gray to black ﬂuorescence, with instant to fast blooming milky cuts. <br/>The curve section landed in the Middle Bakken at an 83.53° angle at 9,914' MD/9,415.35’ TVD on December 16, 2014 at 8:45 PM CST. The ﬁnal curve TD depth of 9,914’ MD was conﬁrmed when the bottoms up sample at this depth contained light bluish gray Middle Bakken dolomite with trace amounts of very dark gray to black shale slough off. Aﬁer BHA was brought to surface, it was discovered that the bit and bit box were missing and left down hole, at which point the decision to drill a curve sidetrack was made. <br/>Sidetrack Curve Section 9, 762 ’ — 9, 882’ MD <br/>The sidetrack curve section of Parshall 97-3332H began in the late evening of December 16, 2014, with the sidetrack being performed due to the bit and bit box becoming detached down hole after landing the original curve section. Building the trough for the sidetrack began at 10:30 PM CST on December 16, 2014, and time drilling began at 9,762’ MD at 11:30 PM. Drilling rates in the sidetrack curve ranged from 0.60 to 57.20 minutes per foot while sliding and rotating, and gas measurements ranged ﬁom 55 to 884 units. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the curve to correlate Parshall 97-3332H with Parshall 98-33H. <br/>The sidetrack curve section landed in the Middle Bakken at an 86.04° angle at 9,882’ MD/9,415.46’ TVD on December 17, 2014 at 4:45 PM CST. The ﬁnal curve TD depth of 9,882’ MD was conﬁrmed when the bottoms up sample at this depth contained light bluish gray Middle Bakken dolomite with trace amounts of very dark gray to black shale slough off. <br/>Sidetrack Horizontal Section 9,882 ’ - 15, 656’ MD <br/>Aﬁer the intermediate casing shoe was set to 9,879’ MD, drilling began in the horizontal section at 7:00 AM CST on December 20, 2014. The Middle Bakken top was ofﬁcially determined at 9,862’ MD/-7,411’ SS from a decrease in gamma values as the gamma tool transitioned ﬁom the UBS into the Middle Bakken dolomite. The curve was generally leveled off within the drilling window at a ~90° angle near measured depth of 10,800’ MD, and the GR Marker was ﬁrst encountered at 10,355’ MD/-7,429’ SS. The </p>

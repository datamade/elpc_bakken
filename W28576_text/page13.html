This encounter was seven feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. The Top Base of Last Salt <br/>was picked by change in rate of penetration, gamma data, and lithology identiﬁcation. Samples consisted of halite. A typical sample was as follows; HALITE: Clear, frosty to translucent, ﬁrm, compacted, trace <br/>sandstone, light orange, red-orange, chalky, soft, 20% limestone, gray, light gray, brown, trace anhydrite, patchy dull yellow ﬂuorescence, weak streaming cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.3-0.6 minutes per foot, and the gas averaged 24 units. <br/>Base ofLast Salt 8, 939’ MD 8,907’ TVD -6,535’ SS <br/>The Base of Last Salt was encountered at 8,939’ measured depth; -6,535’ sub-sea level. This was seven feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. The Last Salt was picked by change in rate of penetration, gamma data, and lithology identiﬁcation. Samples through the Base of Last Salt consisted of limestone with some interbedded anhydrite. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: 65% Cream gray, medium gray, gray tan, carbonaceous, soﬁ to ﬁrm, slightly argillaceous, crystalline; 35% Anhydrite off white to translucent, blocky; poor to fair intergranular porosity; scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, slow thin yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.2-2.5 minutes per foot, and the gas averaged <br/>29 units. Ratclijfe 8,983 ’ MD 8,951 ’ T VD -6,5 79’ SS <br/>The Ratcliffe Formation was encountered at 8,983” measured depth; -6,579’ sub-sea level. This was eight feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. The Ratcliffe was picked by change in rate of penetration, gamma data, and lithology identiﬁcation. Samples through the Ratcliffe consisted of limestone and dolomite. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: 75% Cream gray to light gray, medium gray, gray tan, carbonaceous, slightly argillaceous, soft to ﬁrm, crystalline, 25% Dolomite: light to medium gray, trace anhydrite, off white to white, soft to ﬁrm; scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, slow thin yellow cut. DOLOMITE: 80% Gray, brown gray, medium tan, medium gray, soft to ﬁrm, microcrystalline, moderate induration, poor porosity, calcareous, slightly argillaceous, 20% Limestone, gray, cream gray, light gray, trace anhydrite, cream to off white, dull even yellow ﬂuorescence, cloudy yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.4-2.8 minutes per foot. The gas ranged between 11-202 units. <br/>Rival 9,1]7’ MD 9,085’ TVD -6, 713’ SS <br/>The Rival Formation was encountered at 9,117’ measured depth; -6,713’ sub-sea level; this was ten feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. Samples were limestone and dolomite. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: 80% Medium brown, light brown, tan, beige, brown gray, light to medium gray, soft to ﬁrm, chalky, microcrystalline, moderate to fair induration, poor porosity, calcareous, argillaceous, 20% DOLOMITE: light gray, trace anhydrite, cream to off white, fair yellow, even yellow—white mineral ﬂuorescence, cloudy yellow cut. DOLOMITE: 70% Gray brown, gray to dark gray, light brown, medium gray, soft to firm, chalky, microcrystalline, moderate to fair induration, poor porosity, moderately calcareous, slightly argillaceous, 30% interbedded limestone, gray cream gray, light gray, trace amount of anhydrite, creamy off white, even yellow ﬂuorescence, cloudy yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.1-3.6 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 11-443 units. <br/>Lodgepole 9,801 ’ MD 9, 764 ’ TVD -7,3 92 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Lodgepole was picked at 9,801’ measured depth; -7,392 sub-sea level; this was seven feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. The Lodgepole was picked from change in </p>

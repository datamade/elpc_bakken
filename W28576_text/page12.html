This well is located on Section 32 T155N R93W, Mountrail County, North Dakota. The EN-Fretheim A-155-93-3334H-4 was spud on October 25, 2014. The well reached a total depth for the vertical hole and curve at 11,005’ MD, and 10,674.90’ TVD on October 30, 2014. Total depth of the Three Forks lateral was reached at 21,542’ MD on November 7, 2014, after drilling the EN-Fretheim H-4 in its entirety on this multi-well pad. The Bottom Hole location is 296.11’ FEL & 1,320.09’ FNL Section 34 T155N R93W, This well was drilled using an invert based mud system for the vertical /curve, and saline rich salt water for the lateral. Jon Lindvig, Kevin Tweten, and Jason Scherer of Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided the wellsite geological services, beginning at 8,100’ MD in the Kibbey Formation and concluded in the Three Forks at a total depth of 21,542’ MD. Samples were caught at lagged depths of thirty feet in the vertical and curve and ninety feet in the lateral. They will saved to be archived at Hess Corporation in Houston, Texas and at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 8,100’ — 10,240 ’ ll/ID <br/>Logging services began during drilling of the vertical portion of the well at 8,100’ MD in the Tyler formation at 11:35 AM CDT on October 27, 2014. Neset Total Gas was used for the gas monitoring program. During the vertical portion of the well, drill rates ranged from 0.1-5.9 minutes per foot. Gas ranged from 11-601 units. The vertical portion of the well concluded at a kick off point of 10,240 feet measured depth on October 28, 2014 at 8:12 PM CDT. <br/>Kibbey Lime 8,203 ’ MD 8,1 75 ’ T VD -5,803 ’ SS <br/>The Kibbey Lime was encountered at 8,203’ measured depth; -5,803 ’ sub-sea level. This was three feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. The Kibbey Lime was chosen by a change in gamma data. While drilling through the Kibbey Lime samples consisted of limestone and sandstone. A typical sample was as follows; LIMESTONE: Medium to light gray, tan, carbonaceous, soft to ﬁrm, moderately argillaceous; scattered sandstone, red orange, very fine to time, well rounded to sub rounded, well sorted, fair intergranular porosity; even yellow ﬂuorescence, thin yellow cut. SANDSTONE: Red to red orange, orange, brown, very ﬁne to fine grained, rounded to sub rounded, moderately sorted, moderately argillaceous; crystalline, soft to chalky, carbonaceous; Limestone, 30% light to medium gray, carbonaceous, slightly argillaceous, soft to ﬁrm; yellow mineral ﬂuorescence, thin yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.6-2.4 minutes per foot, and the gas averaged 58 units. <br/>Charles Salt 8,354’MD 8,325’ TVD -5,953’SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Charles Salt was encountered at 8,354’ measured depth; -5,953’ sub-sea level; this four feet high with respect to the prognosis. The Charles Salt was picked by change in rate of penetration, gamma data, and change in lithology, which changed from limestone and sandstone to halite and anhydrite. Samples consisted of halite, sandstone, anhydrite, and limestone. A typical sample was as follows; HALITE: Clear, off white, frosty to translucent, ﬁrm, compacted, scattered sandstone, red, orange, rusty orange, chalky, soft, 25% sandstone, red to orange, pink, trace anhydrite, dull even yellow ﬂuorescence, and slow weak streaming cut. LIMESTONE: Medium to light gray, tan, carbonaceous, moderately argillaceous, soft to ﬁrm; 15% anhydrite, very ﬁne to ﬁne, well rounded to sub rounded, well sorted, fair intergranular porosity; even yellow ﬂuorescence, thin yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 0.9-5.9 minutes per foot. Gas averaged 46 units. </p>

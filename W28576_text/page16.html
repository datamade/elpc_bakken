    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Three Forks 1 0, 810’ MD 10,642 ' T VD -8,2 70’ SS <br/>The Three Forks was encountered at 10,642’ TVD; -8,270’ sub-sea level; this was three feet lower than expected with respect to the prognosis. The Three Forks was picked by change in rate of penetration, gamma data and lithology identiﬁcation. Samples consisted solely of sandstone. A typical sample was as follows; SANDSTONE: Medium to light gray, dark gray, gray, translucent to clear, ﬁne to very fine grained, well sorted, subrounded to subangular, moderately calcareous, moderately argillaceous, poor to fair intergranular porosity, fair light oil staining, 15% Shale, light blue green, gritty, friable argillaceous, dolomitic cernentation, faint even yellow green ﬂuorescence, thick streaming, cloudy yellow cut. Drill rates ranged from 03-83 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 11-2,500 units. <br/>Curve 10,240’— 11,005’MD <br/>The start of the curve was kicked off at 10,240’ MD. Drilling times in the curve below the kick off point were between 0.2-8.3 minutes per foot sliding/rotating. Gas varied between 17-2,500 units. Gamma markers, as well as lagged samples, were utilized throughout the Lodgepole, False Bakken, Upper Bakken, Middle Bakken, Lower Bakken, and Three Forks to correlate TVD (true vertical depth) footage values to the nearest offset wells. The curve was landed at 10:30 PM CDT on October 30, 2014 at a measured depth of 1 1,005 feet and a true vertical depth of 10,674.90 feet. This was 4 feet below the revised target prognosis of 10,671” TVD. Seven inch 35# weight casing was set to a measured depth of 10,983 feet and cement ﬁlled the remainder of the wellbore down to the curve landing measured depth of <br/>11,005 feet. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The EN—Fretheim A-155-93-3334H-4 reached a target depth of 2 1 ,542’ measured depth on November 7, 2014 at 1:30 PM CDT. The projection to bit was 0.35’ high the ideal target line. The wellbore, for the majority of the lateral, deviated +/- 4-8 feet in true vertical depth from the Three Forks <br/>target line. <br/>Kevin T weten, Jon Lindvig, and Jason Scherer Wellsite Geologists </p>

A mud tog will be run from Base of Last Salt to TD & on all laterals: Mudlog to include; total gas chromatograph and sample cuttings - 30' sample intervals in vertical hole & 30' intervals in laterals. A (DBL/GR tog will be run from deepest free-fall depth in 7 inch casing to surface. An MWD GRIROP log will also be run from KOP (where the CBL will tie into) to TD of lateral. <br/>2. Open hole logs are Not anticipated 3 No DST's are planned at this time. <br/>H25 All HZSJelated 5aielyﬁquytent must be installed tested angogerational at a dggih of 500 feet above or 3 $1311qu layerielmiyig iheﬁrsi zonmggied lg <br/>contain 525 (whichever comes ﬁrst) Maximum Formation Pressure and Temp <br/>1. Normal formation pressure gradient is expected (up to 0.5 psi/ﬂ or 96 ppg) from surface to the Bakken Shale. The Bakken Shale. Bakken Middle Member, and Three Forks may be over pressured up to as much as 0.65 psi/fl (12.5 ppg). <br/>2. The maximum anticipated BHT is 260 degrees F. or less. <br/>BOP Equipment Requirements <br/>See attached diagram detailing BOPE speciﬁcations. <br/>1. Rig will be equipped with upper and lower kelly cocks with handles available. <br/>2. inside BOP and TIW valves will be available to use on all sizes and threads of DP used on well. <br/>3. BOP accumulatorwili have enough capacity to close HCR valve. close all rams and annular preventer, and retain minimum of 200 psi above precliarge on the closing manifold without the use of closing pumps. The ﬂuid reservoir capacity shall be at least double the usable ﬂuid volume of the accumulator system capacity & the ﬂuid level shall be maintained at manufacturers recommendation. There will be 2 additional sources of power for the closing pumps (electric and air). Sufﬁcient N2 bottles will be available and will be recharged when pressure falls below manufacturer's minimum. <br/>4. BOP ram preventers will be tested to 5,000 psi for 10 minutes using a test plug (a) when initially installed, (b) after 7 inch casing is nippled up, (c) whenever any seal is broken or repaired, (d) if the time since the previous test exceeds 30 days. Additionally, BOP and casing strings will be tested to 22 Esj/fl (or1_500 psi minimumLfiL 30 minutes, prior to drilling out 9-5/8" and 7" rzsing. Rams and hydraulically operated remote choke line valve will be function tested daily at a minimum (preferably test at every crew change). <br/>5. Remote valve for BOP Ems, HCR 8: choke shall be placed in a location that is readily available to the Driller. The remote BOP valve shall be capable of closing and opening the rams. <br/>6. Hand wheels on BOP shall be equipped with locking devices A locking device shall be placed on annular preventer line valve & must be locked in the open position. This lock shall only be removed when the closing unit is inoperative. <br/>Drilling Fluid and Related Equipment <br/>1. Pumps shall be equipped with stroke counters with displays located in dog house. Slow pump speed shall be recorded on drilling report daily aﬂer mudding up. <br/>2. A Pit Volume Tolalizer will be installed and the readout will be displayed in the dog house. <br/>3. Gas detecting equipment (fora chromatograph) will be installed at shaker, Readouts will be available in dog house and in geologist trailer. 4. In the event gas ﬂow becomes an issue. A flare pit shall be constructed not less than 100' from wellhead & 50' from cuttings handling area. Lines to the ﬂare pit will be straight runs (staked down) and turns will utilize targeted tees. Flare on will be located down wind as much as <br/>possible. An elec1ronic ignitor will be used along with a propane line to provide for a continuous ﬂare pilot. <br/>Drilling Plan Section 1 - Surface Casing» Surface to: 1,920 (Surface Casing Depth 4- 20) Conductor. 16" set at 45‘ — 80' (depending on gravel or coal depths) Hole Size: 13-1/2" Mud: Fresh Water Bits: Type 1 mill tooth, 3- 8"DC, 6 1/2" DC, HWDP <br/>Page 1 </p>

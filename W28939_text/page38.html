"Approximately down the North-South axis" is defined in the order as a "500 ft. corridor" (250' on either side of the axis). <br/>           <br/>    <br/>  <br/>                                         <br/>   <br/>The projected 7" casing point is 1197' FWL and 402' FNL, Sec. 17-T155N-R96W, and approximately 227' S of Hole and 364' W of Hole. XTO Energy, Inc. is placing an isolation packer at the 500‘ corridor well path entry point to isolate all portions of the well bore not contained within the drilling corridor. <br/>   <br/>XTO Energy requests this course of action to enable us to utilize a multi well pad due to environmental concerns in order to create less of a foot print. <br/>Waiver to the 500 ft drilling corridor setback at 7 in casing point is contingent upon the wellbore traversing to the ﬁrst survey that meets the 500 ft drilling corridor based off XTO ENERGY INC.'s proposed directional plan: {1 134' S 8: 1316‘ W, 1 1473' MD} or proposed azimuth {203*}; whichever is the most ex I editions. <br/>Company Telephone Number XTO Ener , lnc. 303-397-3600 FOR STATE use ONLY Address <br/>P.0.

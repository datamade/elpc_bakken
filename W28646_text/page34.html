    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">THE CURVE <br/>The Hansen 44-28TFH curve was drilled with a Smith F3 0T 8.75” bit along with a Baker Hughes mud motor set to 2.4 degrees and an invert mud system. A trip out of the hole began at 9,870’ MD. There was a 30’ rotation made from this point before the sliding for the curve at the KOP of 9,900’ MD. <br/>FALSE BAKKEN 10,342’ MD 10,310’ TVD -8,116’ SS <br/>A 10,342’ MD the False Bakken came in at 10,310’ TVD, 1’ low to prognosis. The gamma reached 149.04 API units while in the False Bakken. The samples for the False Bakken consisted of cream gray to gray tan, with blocky to platy limestone. The samples had weak milky yellow cuts with a peak of 152 units of gas seen in this interval. <br/>SCALLION 10,345 ’ MD 10,313 ’ T VD -8,119’ <br/>The Scallion was the next formation encountered. The scallion came in at 10,345” MD and 10,313’ TVD, 1’ low to prognosis. The gamma cooled back down to 57.38 API units in the Scallion. The Scallion consisted of mostly cream buff Limestone with slow dull milky yellow cuts. Gas peaked at 17 units of gas along with fair milky cuts. <br/>UPPER BAKKEN 10,361 ’ MD 10,324’ T VD -8,130’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale came in at 10,361’ MD, and 10,324’ TVD, this was 2’ high to the prognosis. The gamma reached 591.94 units at this point. Background gas averaged 286 units, peaking 460 units. Samples in the Upper Bakken were black, carbonaceous blocky shale, with instant milky yellow cuts. <br/>MIDDLE BAKKEN 10,390’ MD 10,345’ T VD -8,151 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at a MD of 10,390’ and 10,345’ TVD, 1’ low to the prognosis. The Middle Bakken was picked based on the change in samples and a decrease in gamma from 591.94 units down to 50.45 units API. The Middle Bakken samples consisted mostly of a light to dark cream gray tan platy siltstone. Gas peaked at 528 units of gas along with fair milky cuts. <br/>LOWER BAKEN 10,482’ MD 10,399’ TVD -8,205’ SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale came in at 10,482’ MD, and 10,399’ TVD, this was 5’ high to the prognosis. The gamma reached 717.04 API at this point, and the rate of penetration decreased to 3.77 min/ﬂ. Background gas averaged 373 units, peaking 505 units. Samples in the Lower Bakken were black, carbonaceous blocky shale, with instant milky yellow cuts. </p>

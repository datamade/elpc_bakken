Gamma readings dropped down to 81.47 API. Background gas averaged 495 units, peaking at 7728 units. Samples in the Three Forks consisted mostly of pinkish tan dolomite along with bluish gray platy moderately carbonaceous shale. The curve was landed at a total depth of 10,722’ MD on Tuesday, September 30, 2014 at 7:15 PM CST. 7” intermediate casing was set to 10,702’ MD. </p>

The wellbore would remain relatively level in the formation until 3 downslides were put in at 10,982’ MD to send the wellbore dropping in the formation. This drop would continue until a high side slide was put in at 11,320’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. <br/>The wellbore would begin dropping in the formation following the conclusion of the azimuth turn at 12,108’ MD. A high side slide was put in at 12,088’ MD to level the wellbore off. This slide would send the wellbore rising in the formation until a downslide was put in at 12,518’ MD to prevent the continued rise. Drilling would continue just under the target window. An adjustment to the target window was made to the target window based off the marker seen in this section, moving the dip rate up to 8943 degrees. <br/>3 high side slides were put in at 13,705’ MD to send the wellbore back up into the target window. The wellbore would re—enter the target window at 14,290’ MD. Drilling would continue in the lower portion of the target window until a hard streak would send <br/>the wellbore rising quickly in the formation. This rise would send the wellbore up and out of the target window at 15,090’ MD. <br/>3 downslides were put in starting at 15,410’ MD to counter this rise and send the wellbore back into the target window. These slides would send the wellbore dropping at 15,775’ MD. 3 high side slides were put in at 15,879’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. The wellbore would drop through the base of the target window at 15,990’ <br/>MD. The high side slides put in would send the wellbore rising in the formation once again. <br/>The wellbore would re-enter the target window at 16,580’ MD. A downslide was put in at 16,793’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. 4 more downslides were needed at 17,172’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation and send it dropping back into the target window at 17,770’ MD. <br/>Drilling would continue in the Three Forks Target Window with the wellbore dropping gradually in the rotation.

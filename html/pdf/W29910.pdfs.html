HORIZONTAL WELL<br>
ND STATE 158-95-21-28-6TFH<br>
SWSE Section 16-158N-95W<br>
Williams County<br>
Well File # 29910<br>
Dear Terry:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24759, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft3">200' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the<br>
2560 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 9, 16, 21 &amp; 28, T158N R95W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Liberty may set conductor on permitted wells only. Effective June 1, 2014, a<br>
covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site<br>
beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back<br>
whenever filtration operations are conducted. Due to surficial water adjacent to the well site, a dike is<br>
required surrounding the entire location. LIBERTY RES MNGMT CO must contact NDIC Field<br>
Inspector Tom Delling at 701-770-8660 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum<br>
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10682 S.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft3">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

3. Casing and cementing will be done to protect potentially productive<br>
hydrocarbons, fresh water zones, abnormal pressure zones,<br>
and prospectively valuable mineral deposits.<br>
A. Casing head: 9 5/8&quot; x 11&quot; 5M multi-bowl w/ flange 22&quot; below GL,Initial BOPE test to 5000 psi. unless 9 5/8&quot; is pre set then SOW<br>
Tubing head 11&quot; 5M x 7 1/16&quot; 10M. BOPE test to 5000 psi before drilling out 7&quot; casing shoe.<br>
B. Operators minimum specifications for pressure control equipment are shown on the attached BOP<br>
schematic. After running surface casing and prior to drilling out, blind rams, pipe rams, manifold,<br>
upper and lower kelly cock and safety valve will be pressure tested to 5000 psi. Hydril will be tested<br>
to 2500 psi. Thereafter, the BOPE will be checked daily for mechanical operations and will be noted<br>
in the IADC drilling reports. Before and after running the intermediate casing the BOPE will be tested<br>
in the same manner. BOP will be tested at both high 5000 psi and low pressure to 250 psi.<br>
Gas Buster will be fully rigged up and tested for fluid integrity, using anti-freeze solution<br>
prior to drilling out surface casing.<br>

D. Other Drilling Considerations &amp; Lessons Learned:<br>
1. Gas Buster- Not to be used for venting off flowline. Divert all flow to gas buster.<br>
2. Lateral Drilling- Minimize DLS.<br>
3. Salt Sections: Tight hole and stuck pipe may occur. Control drill +/-5' and back-ream<br>
as necessary. Spot freshwater only if severely stuck.<br>
4. Do not rotate PDC bit inside 7&quot; casing while displacing well with kill weight fluids.<br>
Ensure bit &amp; motor are in open hole section.<br>
5. Transfer OBM from storage tanks to rig tanks over the shaker screens.<br>
6. CaCL Brine truck to location after running/cmt'g 7 inch csg. To be determined each well.<br>

Liberty Resources Completions<br>
David,<br>
Per our conversation on November 4</span><span class="ft5">th </span><span class="ft4">2014 in reference to the use of a frac string in the Liberty Resources<br>
LLC completions.<br>
Liberty Resources is committed to fracturing the Bakken and Three Forks formation without the use of a frac<br>
string. The 7" P-110 32#/ft. casing strength has yield strengths higher than we stimulate at, typically 9,300 psi.<br>
Liberty will be running the CBL and casing integrity log USIT to verify wall thickness prior to initiating any of<br>
the fracture treatments on all the wells we drill.<br>
Thanks you for your efforts.<br>
Cheers<br>

2. A detailed gas gathering pipeline system location map which depicts the following information.<br>
a. Name and location of the destination processing plant.<br>
Name: Tioga Gas Plant<br>
Location: Tioga, North Dakota<br>
b. Name of gas gatherer and location of lines for each gas gatherer in the map vicinity.<br>
Name of Gas Gatherer: HESS Corporation<br>
Location of Lines: Williams County, T158N, R95W. See Figure 1<br>
c. The proposed route and tie-in point to connect the subject wells to an existing gas line:<br>
Williams County, T158N, R95W. See Figure 2<br>
3. Information on the existing line, to which operator proposes to connect to, including:<br>
a. Maximum current daily capacity of the existing gas line or compressor:<br>
5 mmcfd; but with expansion project to increase to 30 mmcfd.<br>
b. Current throughput of the existing gas line or compressor:<br>
~5 mmcfd.<br>
c. Anticipated daily capacity of existing gas line or compressor at date of first gas sales:<br>
30 mmcfd with completion of planned line upgrade.<br>
d. Anticipated throughput of existing gas line or compressor at date of first gas sales:<br>
12 mmcfd ramping up to 24 mmcfd with completion of subject wells.<br>
e. Gas gatherer issues or expansion plans for the area:<br>
Recently expanded Tioga Gas Plant from 110 mmcfd to 250 mmcfd. Plans in place to<br>
expand system in T158N R95W area with additional line to increase capacity to 30<br>
mmcfd.<br>

4. A detailed flowback strategy including:<br>
a. Anticipated date of first production.<br>
June 23, 2015.<br>
b. Anticipated oil and gas rates and duration. If well is on a multi-well pad, include total<br>
for all wells being completed.<br>
Anticipated Oil and Gas Rates and Duration: Well production rates estimated as 1000<br>
bopd and 1.2 mmcfd initial production rate average for 30 days with oil rate declining at<br>
80% thereafter.<br>
Anticipated Oil and Gas Rates and Duration (Multi-Well Pad):<br>
Total production rate for ten wells on pad is 10,000 BOPD and 12 mmcfd expected initial<br>
production rate average for 30 days with oil rate declining at 80% thereafter .<br>
5. Amount of gas the company is currently flaring.<br>
a. Statewide percentage of gas flared (total gas flared/total gas produced) for existing<br>
wells producing from the Bakken petroleum system. Note the Commission's approved<br>
gas capture goals are to reduce flaring to 26% by October 1, 2014, 23% by January 1,<br>
2015, 15% by January 1, 2016, and 10% by October 1, 2020:<br>
Statewide percentage of gas flared for existing Liberty operated wells in June 2014 was<br>
9%.<br>
b. Field-wide percentage of gas flared:<br>
Field-wide (McGregor Field) percentage of gas flared for existing Liberty operated wells<br>
in June 2014 was 6%.<br>
6. Alternatives to flaring.<br>
a. Explain specific alternate systems available for consideration:<br>
We have evaluated alternative gas utilization schemes including gas fired power<br>
generation and pad processing to separate gas liquids.<br>
b. Detail expected flaring reductions if such plans are implemented:<br>
Based upon our existing and planned gas connections and proximity to gas gathering<br>
lines and the Tioga Gas Plant, we do not require additional options for flaring<br>
reductions.<br>

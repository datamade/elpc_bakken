HORIZONTAL WELL<br>
HOLSTEIN FEDERAL 11-25H2<br>
NESE Section 25-153N-94W<br>
McKenzie County<br>
Well File # 30345<br>
Dear Becky:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24888, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is granted on the<br>
condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft2">50' </span><span class="ft0">setback from the north boundary, </span><span class="ft2">200' </span><span class="ft0">setback<br>
from the south boundary and </span><span class="ft2">500' </span><span class="ft0">setback from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 13, 24,<br>
25 &amp; 36 T153N R94W. </span><span class="ft2">Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must<br>
be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and<br>
flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required<br>
surrounding the entire location. Two horizontal wells shall be drilled and completed in each &quot;1280&quot; in the standup 2560-acre<br>
spacing unit described as Sections 13, 24, 25, and 36 T153N R94W within 12 months of each other. If this condition is not met,<br>
the Commission shall schedule the matter for hearing to consider the appropriate spacing unit size. The number of wells in<br>
each &quot;1280&quot; in the standup 2560-acre spacing unit described as Sections 13, 24, 25, and 36, T153N R94W shall ultimately be<br>
equal, in no longer than a twelve-month period. If this condition is not met, the Commission shall schedule the matter for<br>
hearing to consider the appropriate spacing unit size. Two horizontal wells shall be drilled and completed in the standup 1280-<br>
acre spacing unit described as Sections 13 and 24 T153N R94W prior to completing any horizontal well in the standup 2560-acre<br>
spacing unit described as Sections 13, 24, 25, and 36 T153N R94W. CONTINENTAL RESOURCES must contact NDIC Field<br>
Inspector Samuel Skurupey at 701-770-1981 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion<br>
operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and<br>
freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized<br>
representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director<br>
prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The proposed directional<br>
plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 13159'N.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit<br>
on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following<br>
publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn<br>
affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and<br>
any other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit,<br>
the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that notification be given<br>
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The<br>
following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and<br>
time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-<br>
8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a certified copy<br>
of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a<br>
form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the<br>
survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one<br>
adobe document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90<br>
feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement<br>
utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones<br>
can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the<br>
presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production<br>
or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as<br>
one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a<br>
standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>

Re:<br>
Continental Resources standard CCL, CBL, 4-1/2" liner running and testing procedures<br>
Continental Resources' standard practice for running the cement bond log and casing<br>
caliper log is to run both logs immediately after coming out of the hole after TD, prior to running<br>
the 4-1/2" liner, to the deepest depth obtainable; however, if there are well control concerns that<br>
require us to run the liner sooner, only the CBL will be run and the CCL will be run after setting<br>
the liner.<br>
Based on the CCL results, we determine the actual API minimum burst allowance for the 7"<br>
casing. If the downgraded API burst pressure is below our minimum required frac pressures, we<br>
will run a 4-1/2" frac string; if severe wear or holes are found in the casing, we will run a 5"<br>
cemented, to surface, tie back string.<br>
The CBL log is run in order to determine the top of cement, as required by the NDIC.<br>
Our current 4-1/2" liner program for a 1280 unit is 30, evenly spaced, stages with 29 swellable<br>
packers. The liner shoe is set approximately 180 feet off bottom. The shoe stage below the last<br>
packer has 2 joints, a double valved float, one joint, and a ported guide shoe ­ appx 130 ft. The<br>
liner is run using a running tool on the end of 4" DP. The 7" packer/hanger is set about 40 ft<br>
above KOP between two casing collars but conditions occasionally occur that require setting<br>
higher, either through unexpected failure or in order to isolate casing wear close to KOP.<br>
Recently we have tried 40 stage liners and the trend to explore the optimum stage count will<br>
continue.. Once the liner is at depth, a ball is dropped through the DP, the ball is pressured up<br>
against the setting tool to approximately 2500 psi, and the 7" packer/hanger is set.<br>
A push pull test is done to confirm the hanger has set. Then, a 4500 psi pressure test is<br>
completed on the back side of the 4" DP to confirm the packer has set. The setting tool is then<br>
backed off and the 4" DP/running tool is laid down.<br>
Immediately after the rotary rig has been moved off the well location, the 7" csg and liner<br>
packer/ hanger are tested to the frac pressure. The testers will rig up and test the tubing head to<br>
5000 psi. Next a test plug will be run and set, using wire line, in the top of the 7" packer/hanger.<br>
Testers will pressure up to our frac pressure, typically 8500 psi, to confirm the 7" is ready for<br>
completion.<br>

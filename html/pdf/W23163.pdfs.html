RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>
Assistant Director<br>

NWSW Section 4-148N-95W<br>
Dunn County<br>
Well File # 23163<br>
Dear Joseph:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 17623, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is<br>
granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft4">500' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the<br>
north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft4">200' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 640 acre spacing unit consisting of<br>
N/2 Sections 5 &amp; 6 T148N R95W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must<br>
be provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property of the<br>
cuttings generated from drilling the wells into an offsite spacing unit. Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
MARATHON OIL CO must contact NDIC Field Inspector Joyce Eversvik at 701-202-1288 prior to location<br>
construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and<br>
completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of<br>
the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be<br>
inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized<br>
in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinates from the well head at casing point are: 745 N<br>
&amp; 497 W. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 10778 W.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved<br>
drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd<br>
business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.<br>
Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating<br>
circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that would allow the Director to<br>
conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given immediately<br>
upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The<br>
following information must be included:<br>
Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company<br>
representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time.<br>
Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall<br>
file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be<br>
submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional<br>
survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a<br>
timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a certification cover page to<br>
certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft1">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when<br>
sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is hereby<br>
granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing on the date the<br>
well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well records wherever<br>
located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall permit the Director and his<br>
representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or controlled by them, complying with all<br>
safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to have access at all times to any and all records of<br>
wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such<br>
wells shall be made available to them at any time upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be<br>
maintained in strict confidence and shall be available only to the Commission and its staff.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail<br>
cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or<br>
initiating tests.<br>
Logs NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of cement can be<br>
determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma Ray Log must be run from<br>
total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as one paper copy and one digital copy in<br>
LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs,<br>
Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a<br>
solution and establish a standard format for industry to follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval<br>
for the operator to submit an image log as a TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when<br>
the log cannot be produced in its entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a standard<br>
CD, or attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov </span><span class="ft1">Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

BOP EQUIPMENT<br>
Marathon Oil Company's minimum specifications for pressure<br>
control equipment are as follows:<br>
Ram Type:<br>
13 5/8" 5000 psi blind, pipe and annular.<br>
a. Due to Marathon's experience it is felt that the above<br>
referenced BOP equipment is adequate for drilling this well.<br>
The reduced permeability of the target zone along with<br>
Marathon's area experience of drilling over 150 horizontal<br>
wells indicate that a MASP of 3000 psi is more adjusted to<br>
the reality of the reservoir.<br>
BOP and other equipment testing:<br>
a. Floor valve, dart valve, kill valves, check valve, manual<br>
choke line valve, manual top drive valve, hydraulic top<br>
drive valve, HCR, choke house valves, choke manifold,<br>
choke hose, choke line, kill line, upper pipe rams, lower<br>
pipe rams, blind rams (Low Test: 250 psi x 5 min. High<br>
Test: 5000 psi x 10 min.)<br>
b. Annular Preventer (Low Test: 250 psi x 5 min. High Test:<br>
2500 psi x 10 min.)<br>
c. Rotating head and Orbit Valve (Low Test: 250 psi x 5 min.<br>
High Test: 1500 psi x 10 min.)<br>
Frequency:<br>
a. After initial installation (NU BOPE).<br>
b. Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken</span><span class="ft5">.<br>
c. After any repairs compromising seal</span><span class="ft5">.<br>
d. At 30-day intervals.<br>
All other equipment (upper and lower Kelly cocks, IBOP,<br>
etc) will be tested according to Onshore Oil and Gas<br>
Order No. 2.<br>

As per our conversation, Marathon will be adding the following information on all subsequent APD submittals <br>
and this email also covers all pending APD's<br>
Please note that prior to frac'ing, Marathon runs a casing caliper log on every well and if results indicate wear, <br>
either the frac stimulation pressures are reduced accordingly or a tieback liner is run.  If a tieback liner is <br>
used, it is 4 1/2&quot; P110 LTC with a burst of 10690 psi.  If a liner will not be run prior to frac, a sundry notice <br>
(Form 4) will be filed requesting a waiver from 43020321, which requires a flowing well to produce through <br>
tubing and packer.<br>
 <br>
Marathon is presently utilizing a 30 stage frac liner with sliding sleeves.<br>
If you require any additional information, please let us know.<br>
Thanks<br>

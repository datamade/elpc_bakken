Dear Mark:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24180, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval<br>
is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' setback<br>
from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit<br>
consisting of Sections 22 &amp; 27-T148N-R94W. </span><span class="ft4">Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: HRC may set conductor on permitted wells. HRC OPERATING, LLC must<br>
take into consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations<br>
on the above captioned location. Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) "No boiler, portable<br>
electric lighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank."<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be<br>
maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out,<br>
completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. HRC OPERATING, LLC must<br>
contact NDIC Field Inspector Allen Christensen at 701-989-9183 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling<br>
and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent<br>
pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are<br>
prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill<br>
cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal<br>
coordinates from the well head are: 9790 S &amp; 61 E.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be<br>
waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to<br>
evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that<br>
would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the<br>
applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that<br>
notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas<br>
Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit<br>
number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00<br>
p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours<br>
or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall<br>
file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be<br>
submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the<br>
directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the<br>
director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a<br>
certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or<br>
when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Conductors, Rat holes, and Mouse holes <br>
To protect near surface groundwater any conductor, rat, or mouse hole drilled must be constructed with a string of <br>
casing and cemented to ground level.  Any such string must be secured at the surface when not in use.  In addition, all rat <br>
and mouse holes must be plugged with cement and cut off at least 4' below final grade within a reasonable timeframe after <br>
the rig completes drilling operations on the pad. <br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours,<br>
and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the<br>
plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well<br>
bore, and (3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic<br>
cement evaluation log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior<br>
to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format)<br>
copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or<br>
attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft3">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>

RE: FORT BERTHOLD 148-94-22A-27-11H Frac information<br>
David, <br>
 <br>
We have been using a Hybrid as of late, with sliding sleeves at the toe ( 1</span><span class="ft5">st</span><span class="ft4"> 10 or so stages) and plug/perf the remainder.<br>
 <br>
The liner top is still set 100' above the KOP. <br>
 <br>
A frac string is utilized. <br>
 <br>

Subject: FORT BERTHOLD 148-94-22A-27-11H Frac information<br>
 <br>
Mark: Can you double check the basic frac information. The proposed drilling plan has a uncemented liner which means <br>
the frac may be something other than plug and perf. I have been using frac info that you emailed back in 2013 to add to <br>
the well file(see above attachment). <br>
 <br>
Bakken wells: <br>
(General) 4 ½" liner packer/frac port design? Sliding Sleeves, plug and perf, Hybrid of both or another method. <br>
Liner top placement in relation to KOP? <br>
Frac string utilized? <br>
 <br>
Thanks <br>

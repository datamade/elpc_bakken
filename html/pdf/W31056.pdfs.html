SESW Section 24-152N-101W<br>
McKenzie County<br>
Well File # 31056<br>
Dear Victoria:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 25998, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval<br>
is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' setback<br>
from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit<br>
consisting of Sections 13 and 24 T152N R101W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: DUE TO SURFICIAL WATER ADJACENT TO THE WELL SITE, A DIKE<br>
IS REQUIRED SURROUNDING THE ENTIRE LOCATION. THIS WELL IS LOCATED ON AN<br>
AQUIFER: AN ONSITE INSPECTION IS REQUIRED. CONTACT NDIC FIELD INSPECTOR FOR<br>
SITE SPECIFIC STIPULATIONS TO INCLUDE BUT NOT LIMITED TO: CLOSED MUD SYSTEM,<br>
NO DRILLING PIT, AND IMPERMEABLE LINER IS REQUIRED ON THE ENTIRE LOCATION<br>
AND A STRING OF CASING MUST BE PLACED IN THE RAT AND MOUSE HOLE AND<br>
CEMENTED TO GROUND LEVEL.<br>
FURTHERMORE, THE OPERATOR MUST TAKE INTO<br>
CONSIDERATION THE PRODUCTION FACILITY WHEN PLACING THE LINER ON LOCATION.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be<br>
maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out,<br>
completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must<br>
contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling<br>
and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent<br>
pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are<br>
prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill<br>
cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal<br>
coordinate from the well head is: 10107 N.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be<br>
waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to<br>
evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that<br>
would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the<br>
applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that<br>
notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas<br>
Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit<br>
number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00<br>
p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours<br>
or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall<br>
file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be<br>
submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the<br>
directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the<br>
director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a<br>
certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft1">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or<br>
when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Conductors, Rat holes, and Mouse holes <br>
To protect near surface groundwater any conductor, rat, or mouse hole drilled must be constructed with a string of <br>
casing and cemented to ground level.  Any such string must be secured at the surface when not in use.  In addition, all rat <br>
and mouse holes must be plugged with cement and cut off at least 4' below final grade within a reasonable timeframe after <br>
the rig completes drilling operations on the pad. <br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours,<br>
and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the<br>
plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well<br>
bore, and (3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic<br>
cement evaluation log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior<br>
to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format)<br>
copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or<br>
attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft3">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

Purpose of the Plan<br>
The purpose of the emergency plan is to prepare Oasis Operations and Regulatory<br>
Agencies in the event that an emergency will occur that would cause an interruption in<br>
operations or a potential release of hydrocarbons from the location due to an unforeseen<br>
emergency. Flooding is a unique type of potential emergency, although the contact<br>
information and general response procedure will not vary from this plan.<br>
The National Weather Service in Bismarck will issue warnings due to spring snow melt<br>
ice jams, flash floods, and main river flooding; they normally will indicate which areas<br>
have the flood warnings and the expected rise in height of water. The National Weather<br>
Service will normally issue first a Flood Watch next a Flood Warning.<br>
A Flood Watch is issued when the risk of a hazardous hydrologic event has increased<br>
significantly, but its occurrence, location, and/or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to<br>
provide enough lead time so those who need to set their plans in motion can do so.<br>
Watches evolve into warnings, advisories, or they are canceled.<br>
Page 3 of 7<br>
<hr>
<A name=49></a>A Flood Warning is issued when the risk of a hazardous hydrologic event is occurring,<br>
is imminent, or has a very high probability of occurrence. A warning is used for<br>
conditions posing a threat to life or property. The NWS is the single "official" voice<br>
when issuing warnings for life-threatening situations.<br>
A Flood Advisory is for less serious conditions that cause significant inconvenience and,<br>
if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property.<br>
Up to date tracking information can be obtained by monitor the NOAA website at<br>
http://www.noaawatch.gov/floods.php </span><span class="ft0">or </span><span class="ft2">NWS Advanced Hydrologic Prediction<br>
Service </span><span class="ft0">. Another useful site that gives links to NOAA, US Army Corp of Engineers, and<br>
NWS is the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services located:<br>
http://www.nd.gov/des/info/flood.html </span><span class="ft0">. This website also has a listing of local county<br>
emergency managers (click on "Local Resources") on the same site; for the area of<br>
concern which is both McKenzie and Williams County.<br>
This plan provides for Operational response should an emergency jeopardize the well site<br>
location. To be effective, the plan requires the cooperation and effort of each person and<br>
agency participating in the operation of the well. Each person must know his/her<br>
responsibilities and duties should the location face an emergency scenario. Each person<br>
and agency should familiarize themselves with the plan and make any suggestions that<br>
will improve the plan.<br>
It is the intention of Oasis Petroleum to make every effort to provide adequate safeguards<br>
against harm to persons or the environment in the event of an emergency or flood that<br>
may jeopardize this location. However, the initiative rests with the suggestions of the<br>
individuals involved in the operations of the well, who are welcomed to act as a<br>
fundamental tool for providing the safest working conditions possible in the event of an<br>
emergency by following the plan and providing adequate communication to those<br>
involved should the plan need modification. During potential flooding season the well<br>
site should be prepared to implement the plan under short notice.<br>
Operating Procedures<br>
The intent is to produce the well in a way that will not damage the reservoir nor result in<br>
the uncontrolled release of hydrocarbon on the surface. Any spills of hydrocarbons<br>
should be reported to the Production Superintendent and the appropriate governmental<br>
agencies. Operations clean up procedures should be implemented to minimize the impact<br>
to the environment and approved by the appropriate governmental agency.<br>
The complex job of producing oil and gas is a 24 hour around the clock job. Even with<br>
much of the work performed during daylight, oil and gas are being produced at all hours<br>
of the day and night. It is the job of the production operations people to keep the well<br>
safely producing and minimize any impact to the environment. The people involved in<br>
these operations will be the Lease Operator, Roustabouts, Production Foreman,<br>

Emergency Procedures<br>
Drilling Operations:<br>
Drilling operations will be conducted during the winter period when flood or ice jams<br>
severity potential is at a minimum. The drilling location should maintain a 24 inch berm<br>
around the location to contain fluids on location. The drilling will be completed using a<br>
closed loop mud system with no open earth pits. Once drilling and completion operations<br>
are finished the pad size should be shrunk and the disturbed area reclaimed. The<br>
Production pad should have a minimum of two foot diversion berm placed around the<br>
production location. The production facilities will be located on the neighboring Kestrel<br>
pad.<br>
Should the threat of potential flooding occur during drilling operations, then all fuel,<br>
lubricants, chemicals, mud, vehicles, and excess equipment should be moved out of the<br>
flood zone and temporarily stored on the nearest available location at an elevation outside<br>
of the potential flood level. A packer should be set in the deepest casing string and the<br>
drill pipe set on the slips and excess joints laid down. The operations should be shut<br>
down until the Flood Warning or Watch is canceled.<br>
Production Operations:<br>
Flood Watch: Issued for the Missouri River, McKenzie County North Dakota<br>
Page 5 of 7<br>
<hr>
<A name=51></a>Production Superintendent (Conrad Ellis) will confer with the NDIC (John Axtman),<br>
Production Manager (Andy Davison), and Operations General Manager (Eric Bayes) to<br>
determine the path forward and potential severity of the flood.<br>
The Production Superintendent will coordinate with transport trucks and the Lease<br>
Operator to reduce any excess chemicals from the location. The diversion berm (2')<br>
around the location should be repaired as necessary. The containment berms around the<br>
production equipment at the Kestrel location should be repaired. The location, wellhead,<br>
and production equipment should be cleaned if necessary of excess lubricants or oil. The<br>
access road will be monitored and additional construction equipment will be placed on<br>
standby to ensure continued access to the location. Should access be jeopardize the<br>
Production Superintendent will move to the next level of Emergency Response. The<br>
Production Superintendent will continue to monitor the Flood Warnings until they are<br>
canceled. Impacted Government Agencies should communicate any additional<br>
information or concerns to the Production Superintendent.<br>
Flood Warning: Issued for the Missouri River, McKenzie County North Dakota<br>
Production Superintendent (Conrad Ellis) will confer with the NDIC (John Axtman),<br>
Production Manager (Andy Davison), and Operations General Manager (Eric Bayes) to<br>
determine the path forward and potential severity of the flood. Impacted Government<br>
Agencies should communicate any additional information or concerns to the Production<br>
Superintendent.<br>
The Production Superintendent will coordinate with the Lease Operator to ensure the<br>
following:<br>
1. Shut the producing well in.<br>
2. Flush all flow lines of excess production fluids with fresh water.<br>
3. Place a minimum of 6 feet of produced water in all tanks and heater treaters.<br>
4. Remove all chemicals and lubricants from the location. Drain and flush all<br>
transfer lines with fresh water. Wells located in potential high flow flood water<br>
areas should have tank to ground tie downs installed.<br>
5. Isolate and shut in all valves.<br>
6. Tighten the pack off on the stuffing box to prevent communication; remove any<br>
self lubricator on the polished rod. Set the brake on the pumping unit. Steam<br>
clean wellhead and pumping unit as required, vacuum up cleaning fluids.<br>
7. Isolate all power to the location.<br>
8. Remove electrical motors or transfer pumps that may be submerged.<br>
9. The access road will be monitored and additional construction equipment will be<br>
placed on standby to ensure continued access to the location as appropriate. The<br>
diversion berm (2') should be in good repair.<br>
10.The Production Superintendent will continue to monitor the Flood Watch or<br>
Flood Warnings until they are canceled.<br>
11.The Production Superintendent will continue to communicate with impacted<br>
Governmental Agencies and modify the implementation of the plan as required.<br>

<A name=52></a>Procedure to Return well to Production post Flooding Event:<br>
Production Superintendent (Conrad Ellis) will confer with the NDIC (John Axtman),<br>
Production Manager (Andy Davison), and Operations General Manager (Eric Bayes) to<br>
make an initial inspection of the location. Impacted Government Agencies should<br>
communicate any additional information or concerns to the Production Superintendent.<br>
Based on this site inspection, a plan will be developed to safely return the well to<br>
production. An approved plan by the NDIC will be implemented and should consider the<br>
following:<br>
1. The Production Superintendent will continue to communicate with impacted<br>
Governmental Agencies and modify the implementation of the plan as required<br>
and modify the plan with any concerns or issues raised by the impacted parties.<br>
2. The access road should be inspected to ensure it stable enough to handle truck and<br>
equipment loads. Repairs should be completed as necessary.<br>
3. The production site should be cleared of excess water within the containment<br>
berm. The water should be tested to see if it can be used in Oasis Operations, or if<br>
safe diverted outside of the berm (this will require a permit from the<br>
NDIC).Otherwise dispose of the water in the proper facilities. After the excess<br>
water has been removed, the site should be allowed to dry. If the 2' containment<br>
berm has been damaged this should be repaired.<br>
4. Any water trapped within the production containment berm should be tested for<br>
use in operations or hauled to disposal as the volumes dictate. The site should be<br>
allowed to dry.<br>
5. Any excess soil or sediments deposited by the flooding event should be removed<br>
or added to the containment berm, the location should be leveled and have<br>
additional gravel base applied to allow safe operations. Correct drainage<br>
diversion, culverts, cattle guards should be cleaned or repaired as necessary.<br>
6. The production equipment should be evaluated to ensure that it is still stable and<br>
has not moved due to the flooding event. All footings and cement slabs should be<br>
inspect and ensure that they are still level.<br>
7. Electrical motors and transfer pumps should be reinstalled. A certified electrician<br>
should inspect wiring and repair damaged panels. The site should then have<br>
electricity restored.<br>
8. The pumping unit should be inspected for flood damage; repairs should be made<br>
to level the unit. Lubricants should be restored.<br>
9. All lines and valves should be inspected and retested as required. The Lease<br>
Operator, Field Foreman, and Production Superintendent should re-commission<br>
the well for production.<br>
10.Seek final approval from the NDIC that the well has tested and ready for<br>
production. Return well to Production.<br>

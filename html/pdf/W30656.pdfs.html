WRIGHT FEDERAL 21-5HU<br>
LOT3 Section 5-148N-99W<br>
McKenzie County<br>
Well File # 30656<br>
Dear Crissy:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 25405, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, shall be located<br>
approximately down the north-south axis (500' drilling corridor, per Commission policy) </span><span class="ft0">and no closer<br>
than </span><span class="ft2">200 feet to the north or south boundary </span><span class="ft0">within the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 5, 6, 7<br>
&amp; 8, T148N R99W. </span><span class="ft2">Tool error need not be considered except when deemed necessary by the<br>
Director pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: The heel perforation in the 4.5&quot; liner must be located within the 500 foot<br>
drilling corridor. Based on Whiting's proposed Directional Plan, the heel perforation must be no less<br>
than 12615MD or 1521W. Secondly, WHITING MUST HAVE A SPILL CONTINGENCY PLAN IN<br>
PLACE PRIOR TO SPUDDING THIS WELL. Also, Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof<br>
container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the<br>
well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration<br>
operations are conducted. In addition, CONDUCTOR MAY BE SET ON PERMITTED WELLS<br>
ONLY. WHITING OIL AND GAS CORP must contact NDIC Field Inspector Samuel Skurupey at<br>
701-770-1981 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum<br>
legal coordinate from the well head is: 9829' S.<br>

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft4">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>

PRESSURE CONTROL EQUIPMENT<br>
A. Type:<br>
Eleven (11) inch double gate hydraulic BOP with eleven (11) inch annular preventer<br>
with 5,000 psi Casinghead and 5,000 psi Tubinghead.<br>
B. Testing Procedure:<br>
The annular preventer will be pressure tested to 50% of stack rated working pressure for ten (10)<br>
minutes or until provisions of test are met, whichever is longer. The BOP, choke manifold, and<br>
related equipment will be pressure tested to approved BOP stack working pressure (if isolated from<br>
surface casing by a test plug) or to 70% of surface casing internal yield strength (if BOP is not<br>
isolated by a test plug). Pressure will be maintained for ten (10) minutes or until the requirements of<br>
the test are met, whichever is longer. At a minimum, the Annular and Blow-Out Preventer pressure<br>
tests will be performed:<br>
1.<br>
When the BOPE is initially installed;<br>
2.<br>
Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken;<br>
3.<br>
Following related repairs; and<br>
4.<br>
At thirty (30) day intervals.<br>
Annular will be function tested weekly, and pipe &amp; blind rams activated each trip, but not more than<br>
once per day. All BOP drills &amp; tests will be recorded in IADC driller's log.<br>
C. Choke Manifold Equipment:<br>
All choke lines will be straight lines whenever possible at turns, tee blocks will be used or will be<br>
targeted with running tees, and will be anchored to prevent whip and vibration.<br>
D. Accumulator:<br>
Accumulator will have sufficient capacity to open hydraulically-controlled choke line valve (if so<br>
equipped), close all rams plus annular preventer, and retain a minimum of 200 psi above precharge on<br>
the closing manifold without the use of closing unit pumps. The fluid reservoir capacity will be<br>
double accumulator capacity and the fluid level will be maintained at manufacturer's<br>
recommendations. Accumulator precharge pressure test will be conducted prior to connecting the<br>
closing unit to the BOP stack.<br>
E. Miscellaneous Information:<br>
Choke manifold and BOP extension rods with hand wheels will be located outside rig sub-structure.<br>
Hydraulic BOP closing unit will be located at least twenty-five (25) feet from the wellhead but readily<br>
accessible to the driller. Exact locations and configurations of the hydraulic BOP closing unit will<br>
depend upon the particular rig contracted to drill this hole.<br>
A flare line will be installed after the choke manifold with the discharge point of the flare line to a<br>
separate pit located at least 125 feet away from the wellbore and any existing production facilities.<br>

Productive Interval<br>
A marker joint system will be set at 12,615' MD/11,223' TVD on the eastern edge of the 500' swath straddling<br>
Sections 5 &amp; 6, T148N-R99W in the 4-1/2" liner. A collar locator will be used to mark that boundary joint as the final interval<br>
for fracturing and stimulation. The eastern interval in the 4-1/2" cemented liner running up to the 7" casing shoe will not be<br>
fracture stimulated. A plug and perf type program will be used to isolate the fracturing and stimulation in the allowed<br>
productive 500' strip as per NDIC Outlines.<br>

Typical Completion Procedure<br>
Bakken or Three Forks<br>
After Drilling Rig Moves Off Location<br>
1. MIRU wire line, RIH with gauge ring to at least 100 ft beyond liner top, POOH.<br>
2. RIH and set retrievable plug in liner hanger or in completion liner, POOH with wireline. Run<br>
CBL, CCL, GR and casing inspection tool from liner top to surface.<br>
3. Pressure test 7" (intermediate) casing and frac valve.<br>
4. MI and fill (with fresh water) a sufficient number of frac tanks to ensure there will be enough<br>
water for the designed frac job.<br>
5. MIRU flowback company, rig flowback separator (4 phase) and flowback iron from wellhead to<br>
pit.<br>
6. MIRU all frac company equipment, RU all equipment necessary to frac well.<br>
7. Pumping frac job as per design.<br>
8. Flowback crew returns to location, inspects and conducts pressure test on all flowback<br>
equipment/iron. Begin flowback of well - 24 hrs/day operation.<br>
9. After flowback testing, direct full well stream to production battery.<br>
10. RD and MO flowback equipment and crew.<br>
11. Turn well over to production department.<br>
Note:<br>
If casing inspection log or indicates excessive wear in 7" casing or other conditions require a frac<br>
string to be run, the CBL, GR, CCL and casing inspection tool will be run and the 7" casing<br>
pressure tested to a lower rating. After the frac string is run, a retrievable plug will be set and the<br>
frac string tested prior to fracing<br>

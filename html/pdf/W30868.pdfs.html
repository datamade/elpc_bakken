STATE 160-100-21-16-1H<br>
SWSE Section 21-160N-100W<br>
Divide County<br>
Well File # 30868<br>
Dear Terry:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 22213, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is granted on the<br>
condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' </span><span class="ft1">setback from the north &amp; south boundaries<br>
and </span><span class="ft3">1220' </span><span class="ft1">setback (per Commission policy) from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 16 &amp;<br>
21 T160N R100W. </span><span class="ft3">Tool error need not be considered except when deemed necessary by the Director pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must<br>
be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and<br>
flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required<br>
surrounding the entire location. This well is located on an aquifer: An onsite inspection is required. Contact NDIC Field<br>
Inspector for site specific stipulations to include but not limited to: Closed Mud System, no drilling pit, and impermeable liner<br>
is required on the entire location and a string of casing must be placed in the rat and mouse hole and cemented to ground level.<br>
Furthermore, the operator must take into consideration the production facility when placing the liner on location. NORTH<br>
PLAINS ENERGY LLC must contact NDIC Field Inspector Marc Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion<br>
operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and<br>
freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized<br>
representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director<br>
prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The proposed directional<br>
plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 10075'N.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit<br>
on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following<br>
publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn<br>
affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and<br>
any other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit,<br>
the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that notification be given<br>
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The<br>
following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and<br>
time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-<br>
8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a certified copy<br>
of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a<br>
form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the<br>
survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one<br>
adobe document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90<br>
feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement<br>
utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones<br>
can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the<br>
presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production<br>
or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as<br>
one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a<br>
standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>

SMOKY BUTTE FIELD <br>
STATE 16010021161H <br>
Divide County, ND<br>
 <br>
 <br>
OneOk Rockies Midstream, LLC (ORM) will gather and process North Plains Energy's (NPE) gas production <br>
from  its  operated  wells  in  the  Smoky  Butte  Field.   Gas  will  be  gathered  into  ORM's  Crosby  (Divide)  and <br>
Alamo (Divide/Williams) systems and processed at ORM's Stateline Plant in Williams County, S21T155N<br>
103W.  ORM installed LP gas gathering lines in the eastern standup units of Smoky Butte Field in 2013 to <br>
gather  and  process  gas  from  Baytexoperated  wells.   No  other  midstream  gas gathering lines exist in the <br>
immediate  area  at  present  other  than  ORM's.   ROW  acquisition  is  in  progress  for  buildout  of  the  Smoky <br>
Butte  Field  gas  gathering  system.   ORM  projects  tieing  in  NPE's  Smoky  Butte  producing  wells  starting  in <br>
November and December 2014 with anticipated completion in first quarter 2015.  The State 1601002116<br>
1H  pad  location  is  located  along  OneOk's  gathering  line  ROW  and  will  commence  gas  sales  upon  its <br>
completion in 2015. <br>
 <br>
ORM's nearest gas plant and compressor station design capacities and current throughput volumes as of <br>
October 2014 are described below.  ORM's Crosby Station will handle 20 MMcfd and have spare capacity by <br>
the  end  of  4Q14.   Their  Crosby  and  Alamo  gathering  systems  are  projected  to  handle  100%  of  NPE's gas <br>
production with new initial rates projected at 375 Mcfd peak production per well.</span><span class="ft9">    <br>

NPE  is  scheduled  to  drill  the State 16010021161H location in 2Q2015.  NPE completed the Amundson <br>
well (File No. 23707) in Sept2014 and is currently drilling the 2well Stevens pad (File Nos. 28519, 28520) <br>
with scheduled completion in Nov/Dec2014.  Well flowback commences during lateral cleanout, and the <br>
wells will be put on ESP after cleanout operations.  Anticipated average IP90 rates are 350 BOPD and 300 <br>
Mcfd.   NPE  utilizes  wellhead  gas  for  infield  electric  power  generation  for  artificial  lift  and  SWD  pump <br>
operations in Smoky Butte Field.   <br>
 <br>
NPE  currently  utilizes  20%  of  its  produced  gas  in  North  Dakota  for  electric  power  generation  for  its  7 <br>
producing wells and 3 SWD wells.  NPE presently produces ~800 Mcfd in total and flares approximately 80% <br>
of its gas production on a statewide basis.  All NPE wells are 1</span><span class="ft11">st</span><span class="ft8"> wells in spacing units.  NPE's flare % ratio is <br>
projected to decline to &lt;50% by 12/15/2014 and &lt;20% by 4/1/2015 with ORM's gas gathering installation in <br>
the T160/161R100 area completed through the 1</span><span class="ft11">st</span><span class="ft8"> quarter of 2015.  NPE currently operates 4 wells in the <br>
Smoky Butte Field with a flare rate of 80%.  All of NPE's Smoky Butte wells are scheduled to be tied into <br>
ORM's  sales  line  within  the  next  23  months,  with  the  two  new  4Q14  wells  to  be  tied  in  upon <br>
commencement of production.  No other alternatives to gas flaring (than current power generation use of <br>
gas) are considered economic at this time, given the forecast of gas sales commencing in 23 months.  <br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>
Assistant Director<br>

PERMIT STIPULATION<br>
Dear OPERATOR:<br>
The below stipulation is applicable to all of the permits on the enclosed list.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be<br>

Dunn County<br>
Well File # 19624<br>
Dear David :<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 15431, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft5">200' setback </span><span class="ft4">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft5">500' setback </span><span class="ft4">from the east &amp; west boundaries within<br>
the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 30 and 31, 148N, 93W. </span><span class="ft5">Note: Tool error is not required<br>
pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: CLOSED OR SEMI-CLOSED LOOP MUD SYSTEMS ARE REQUIRED<br>
ON MULTI-WELL DRILL PADS, ALTHOUGH THE SYSTEM IS SUBJECT TO NDIC<br>
INSPECTOR APPROVAL. IN CASES WHERE AN OFFSITE SPACING UNIT IS ACCESSED<br>
FROM A MULTI-WELL DRILL PAD, AN AFFIDAVIT MUST BE PROVIDED AFFIRMING THAT<br>
THE SURFACE OWNER OF THE MULTI-WELL PAD AGREES TO ACCEPT BURIAL ON<br>
THEIR PROPERTY OF THE CUTTINGS GENERATED FROM DRILLING THE WELL(S) INTO<br>
AN OFFSITE SPACING/DRILLING UNIT.<br>
New Policy<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given<br>
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division,<br>
Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,<br>
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.<br>
and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours<br>
or on the weekend.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey<br>
contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.<br>
Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director<br>
may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft1">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is<br>
hereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing<br>
on the date the well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well<br>
records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall<br>
permit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or<br>
controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to<br>
have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect<br>
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time<br>
upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and<br>
shall be available only to the Commission and its staff.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
Please be advised approval for use of a drilling reserve pit or drill cuttings pit on this site is contingent on<br>
site specific conditions and special pit closure requirements may apply.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of<br>
cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma<br>
Ray Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as<br>
one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image<br>
logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced<br>
in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to<br>
follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a<br>
TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its<br>
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a standard CD, or attached to an<br>
email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov </span><span class="ft1">Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

NOTE: A Gamma Ray log must be run to ground surface and a CBL must be run on intermediate or longstring casing string if set.<br>
Surveys are required at least every 30 feet in the build section and every 90 feet in the lateral section of a horizontal well. Measurement<br>
inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the<br>
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less and the well bore is within<br>
150 feet of the respective setback requirement; or 2) If industry standard methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field<br>
order for exceptions.<br>
If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well<br>
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.<br>
REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS: Certified surveyor's plat, horizontal section plat, estimated geological tops, proposed mud/cementing plan,<br>
directional plot/plan, $100 fee.<br>

COMMENTS, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, AND/OR LIST OF ATTACHMENTS<br>
This well is located on an existing well pad that will include 4 wells {two Bakken wells already approved and two Three Forks wells}. The Bakken wells are the Ethan Hall 6B-7-1H {File #18545} and the Ethan Hall<br>
6B-31-30-1H {File #18546}. Attachments include: Well plat, pad layout, location map, mud/cement plant, directional plot/plan, section breakdown plat, and a request for a logging waiver {Form 4}. Per NDIC<br>
requirements for multi-well pads, Enerplus will be using a semi-closed loop system.<br>

Cementing Program<br>
Surface Casing: 9 5/8-inch surface pipe would be cemented back to the surface with 55%<br>
excess using:<br>
· Lead Slurry: 401 sacks of Econocem System + 0.125 lb/sk Poly-E-Flake (12.0<br>
ppg/2.39 ft</span><span class="ft5">3</span><span class="ft4">/sk)<br>
· Tail Slurry: 250 sacks of Swiftcem System + 0.125 lb/sk Poly-E-Flake (14.3 ppg/1. 46<br>
ft</span><span class="ft5">3</span><span class="ft4">/sk)<br>
Wait-on-Cement (WOC) time minimum of 12 hours or until stabilized. Surface casing should<br>
be allowed to stand under pressure until the tail cement has reached a compressive strength of<br>
500 pounds per square inch (psi).<br>
Intermediate Casing: 7-inch intermediate casing would be cemented back to the surface with<br>
30% excess using:<br>
· Scavenger: 125 sacks Poz Scavenger Slurry (9.0 ppg / 9.08 ft</span><span class="ft5">3</span><span class="ft4">/sk)<br>
· Lead Slurry: 102 sacks Premium Lite + Additives (12.0 ppg / 2.34 ft</span><span class="ft5">3</span><span class="ft4">/sk)<br>
· Tail #1 Slurry: 248 sacks Class "G" with silica flour + Additives (15.6 ppg / 1.58<br>
ft</span><span class="ft5">3</span><span class="ft4">/sk)<br>
· Tail #2 Slurry: 444 sacks Class "G" + Additives (15.6 ppg / 1.59 ft</span><span class="ft5">3</span><span class="ft4">/sk)<br>
WOC time minimum of 24 hours, or until stabilized. Intermediate casing should be allowed to<br>
stand under pressure until the tail cement has reached a compressive strength of 500 psi.<br>

<A name=36></a>Enerplus Anna G. Baker 6B-30-2H TF Exploratory Well -- Mud and Cementing Plan<br>
Stimulation:<br>
The well would be fracture-stimulated down 4 ½-inch frac string.<br>
The evaluation program could change at the discretion of the well-site geologist.<br>
5.<br>
Surveys<br>
Measure-while-drilling (MWD) surveys would be recorded every 100 feet in the vertical hole,<br>
a minimum of every 30 feet while building the curve, and every 90 feet while drilling the<br>
lateral section. MWD GR would be run from the kick-off point (KOP) to lateral total depth.<br>

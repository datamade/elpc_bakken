Dear Mike:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 22420, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft4">500' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft4">200' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the<br>
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 26 &amp; 27 T148N R93W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must<br>
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are<br>
conducted. KODIAK OIL &amp; GAS (USA) INC must contact NDIC Field Inspector Allen Christensen at<br>
701-989-9183 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum<br>
legal coordinate from the well head is: 9878' west.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft1">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft4">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

D. Choke Manifold Equipment:<br>
All choke lines will be straight lines unless turns use tee blocks or are targeted with<br>
running tees, and will be anchored to prevent whip and vibration. A 4" 10M flex hose<br>
may be used from the well head to the choke manifold.<br>
E. Accumulator:<br>
The accumulator will have sufficient capacity to open the hydraulically-controlled gate<br>
valve (if so equipped), close all rams plus the annular preventer, and retain a minimum<br>
of 200 psi above precharge on the closing manifold without the use of the closing unit<br>
pumps. The fluid reservoir capacity will be double the usable fluid volume of the<br>
accumulator system capacity and the fluid level of the reservoir will be maintained at the<br>
manufacturer's recommendations.<br>
The BOP system will have two (2) independent power sources available for powering<br>
the closing unit pumps. Sufficient nitrogen bottles are suitable as a backup power<br>
source only, and shall be recharged when the pressure falls below manufacturer's<br>
specifications. The accumulator precharge pressure test will be conducted prior to<br>
connecting the closing unit to the BOP stack and at least once every six (6) months<br>
thereafter. The accumulator pressure will be corrected if the measured precharge<br>
pressure is found to be above or below the maximum or minimum limits specified in<br>
Onshore Oil &amp; Gas Order Number 2 (only nitrogen gas may be used to precharge).<br>
A manual locking device (i.e., hand wheels) or automatic locking device will be<br>
installed. A valve will be installed in the closing line as close as possible to the annular<br>
preventer to act as a locking device. This valve will be maintained in the open position<br>
and will be closed only when the power source for the accumulator system is<br>
inoperative.<br>
Remote controls shall be readily accessible to the driller. Remote controls for 5M or<br>
greater systems will be capable of both opening and closing all preventers. Master<br>
controls will be at the accumulator and will be capable of opening and closing all<br>
preventers and the choke line valve (if so equipped).<br>
F. Miscellaneous Information:<br>
The Blow-Out Preventer and related pressure control equipment will be installed, tested<br>
and maintained in compliance with the specifications in and requirements of Onshore<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Order Number 2. The hydraulic BOP closing unit will be located at least<br>
twenty-five (25) feet from the well head but readily accessible to the driller. Exact<br>
locations and configurations of the hydraulic BOP closing unit will depend upon the<br>
particular rig contracted to drill this hole.<br>
A flare line will be installed after the choke manifold, extending 100 feet (minimum)<br>
from the center of the drill hole to a separate flare pit.<br>

The 7" intermediate casing will be landed in the horizontal section of the Bakken Formation before<br>
commencement of drilling the lateral.<br>
3<br>
Kodiak may elect to have the liner isolated with swell packers or equivalent.<br>
The surface casing will have centralizers on the bottom three (3) joints with a stop ring<br>
utilized midway on the shoe joint. Then every third joint for a total of 17 centralizers.<br>
Casing string(s) will be pressure tested to 0.22 psi/foot of casing string length or 1,500<br>
psi, whichever is greater (not to exceed 70% of the internal yield strength of the casing),<br>
after cementing and prior to drilling out from under the casing shoe.<br>
The 7" intermediate casing string has been designed for service in a sour gas (H</span><span class="ft4">2</span><span class="ft0">S) and<br>
salt environment. The intermediate casing will have turbolizers on the bottom three (3)<br>
joints, then every other joint to 45 degrees. Centralizers will be used every other jt from<br>
45 degrees to KOP, then every fourth joint to the top of the Dakota sands.<br>
The 4½" liner will be centralized with standoff bands on every other joint.<br>
B. Cementing Program:<br>
Surface Casing<br>
- Lead with approximately 500 sx Econocem W1 + 0.25 pps Poly<br>
E Flake cement mixed at 11.5 ppg (yield = 2.98 ft</span><span class="ft4">3</span><span class="ft0">/sx).<br>

Flake mixed at 14.2 ppg (yield = 1.49 ft</span><span class="ft4">3</span><span class="ft0">/sx). Cement will be<br>
circulated back to surface with 40% excess. Top out if<br>
necessary.<br>

0.25 pps Poly E Flake + 35% SSA-1 mixed at 15.6 ppg (yield =<br>
1.56 ft</span><span class="ft3">3</span><span class="ft0">/sx).<br>
Lead cement will be circulated half way into the 9 5/8" shoe,<br>
about 1200' MD.<br>
Liner Casing-<br>
Tail with approximately 550 sx EXTENDACEM + 0.55% HR-5<br>

ppg (yield = 1.77 ft</span><span class="ft3">3</span><span class="ft0">/sx). TOC above the PBR.<br>
The above cement volumes are approximate and were calculated under the assumption that a<br>
gauge hole will be achieved with a 10% excess factor. Actual cement volumes may vary due to<br>
variations in the actual hole gauge and may be determined by running a caliper log on the drilled<br>
hole.<br>
All waiting on cement (WOC) times will be adequate to achieve a minimum of 500 psi<br>
compressive strength at the casing shoe prior to drilling out.<br>

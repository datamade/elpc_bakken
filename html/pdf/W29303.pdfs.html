INTRODUCTION<br>
Continental Resources, Inc. drilled the Frisco 2-31H1 as a two-section lateral targeting the first<br>
bench of the interbedded silty, argillaceous dolomite and shale of the Upper Devonian Three<br>
Forks formation in McKenzie County, North Dakota within the Grass Bluff Field. This is the<br>
second vertical and curve drilled of a two well pad, and the first lateral to be completed. Below<br>
the Pronghorn Member and conformably overlying the Birdbear Formation, the Three Forks<br>
carbonate sequence was deposited in a shallow epeiric sea paleoenvironment during supra tidal<br>
conditions. The surface hole location is in the Southeast one-quarter of the Southeast one-quarter<br>
of Section 31, Township 152 North, Range 102 West (395' FSL &amp; 898' FEL). The well then<br>
traverses North to a final bottom hole location 230' from the North section line and 1322' from<br>
the East section line (230' FNL &amp; 1322' FEL) of Section 30, Township 152 North, Range 102<br>
West.<br>
PLAN<br>
The vertical portion of the Frisco 2-31H1 was planned to be drilled to a kick-off point of<br>
10591'MD, within the Mississippian Lodgepole Formation. Build rates of 12 degrees per 100'<br>
were required to land the curve with the bit inclined approximately 90 degrees within the<br>
targeted interval, 16' below the top of the Three Forks (6' below the base of the Pronghorn),<br>
according to prognosis. Intermediate casing would then be set and cemented at 11270'MD<br>
(10845'TVD), prior to drilling the lateral portion of the well. The horizontal well would be<br>
drilled to a planned total depth of 20729'MD, within the Northeast one-quarter of the Northeast<br>
one-quarter of Section 30, Township 152 North, Range 102 West (200' FNL &amp; 1320' FEL).<br>
OFFSET WELLS<br>
The primary offset used was the vertical Iverson 1-31H, situated Northeast of the Frisco 2-31H1<br>
surface hole location. The Iverson 1-31H gamma ray type log data in addition to several other<br>
offset wells (Frisco 3-31H, Frisco 1-31H, Miramar 2-31H, Miramar 3-31H1) were used to<br>
facilitate formation thicknesses in the area as well as lithology, estimated zones of porosity, and<br>
an accurate projection of a curve landing target depth throughout the vertical and build sections<br>
of the Frisco 2-31H1. These data, in conjunction with Mission Canyon structural isopachs<br>
(thought to be conformable to the Three Forks Formation), were utilized to predict the local<br>
structure to be encountered during the lateral section of the Frisco 2-31H1 and to aid in<br>
geosteering decisions. The Frisco 1-31H was a north-bearing lateral well drilled parallel to the<br>
Frisco 2-31H1 within the Middle Bakken pool. Its completed geosteering cross section,<br>
interpreted with the use of gamma ray logging and borehole data during the lateral portion of the<br>
Frisco 1-31H, was used as an additional type log for geosteering purposes.<br>

ENGINEERING OPERATIONS<br>
Vertical<br>
Continental Resources began drilling operations using H&amp;P rig 320 on December 1, 2014. 36<br>
weight P110 9.625&quot; diameter surface casing was cemented in place at 2175' prior to the arrival<br>
of H&amp;P 320. NorAm Wellsite Services began geological supervision at 8550' MD on December<br>
3, 2014. Vertical operations were completed with 2 8.75&quot; bits at a total depth of 10220'MD on<br>
December 6, 2014. Diesel based drilling mud weighing 9.6-9.9 ppg was used throughout the<br>
vertical section.<br>
Curve Build<br>
The build section began early on the morning of December 6, 2014 at 10220'MD with a fixed<br>
2.38 degree mud motor and 8.75&quot; PDC bit. The curve was drilled to a measured depth of 11320';<br>
a total of 1100' in 15.4 hours. Necessary build rates were achieved and the bit was landed at<br>
10830' TVD, 22' into the targeted first bench of the Upper Devonian Three Forks formation. 32<br>
weight LTC 7" diameter intermediate casing was installed and cemented in place at 11308'<br>
(11308' MD &amp; 10830' TVD) on the morning of December 8, 2014.<br>
Lateral<br>
The active drilling fluid system was switched to saltwater based brine for the lateral portion of<br>
the Frisco 2-31H1, with a mud weight 9.8-10.2 ppg. Lateral drilling resumed along a general 0-<br>
degree North azimuth on December 9, 2014, after drilling out of the 7&quot; intermediate casing shoe<br>
with a 6&quot; Smith PDC bit and a fixed 1.5 degree mud motor at 11308'MD, 10830'TVD. The north<br>
bearing Frisco 2-31H1 lateral was then drilled to a depth of 17039'MD on December 12, 2014<br>
for a total of 5731' drilled in 49.58 circulating hours, at which time the decision was made to<br>
come out of the hole to replace the bottom hole assembly due to an increasingly consistent low<br>
penetration rate (&lt;75'/hour). At this time MWD tools were reprogrammed and a new 6&quot; bit and<br>
1.5 degree fixed bend mud motor were subsequently tripped into the hole. Total depth was<br>
reached on December 15, 2014 with a final projection to bit at 20595'MD, 10843.3'TVD,<br>
concluding the 7 day, 9287'MD Frisco 2-31H1 lateral well. The bottom hole location (BHL) is<br>
approximately 230' from the North line (FNL) and 1322' from the East line (FEL) of Section 30,<br>
Township 152 North, Range 102 West.<br>

GEOLOGIC EVALUATION<br>
Methods<br>
NorAm Wellsite Services provided wellsite geologic supervision for the Frisco 2-31H1. A two-<br>
person team of geologists provided geosteering services while logging drill cuttings and<br>
monitoring gas from 8550'MD until the well was drilled to completion and production liner was<br>
set. Lagged total gas, calibrated to a one percent Methane in air standard, and chromatography<br>
data were monitored and recorded using a NorAm Wellsite Services Advanced Gas Detector<br>
(AGD 08), including a Continental Laboratories MP2300 total gas detector and Varian<br>
chromatograph. Geosteering and borehole guidance were accomplished with the aid of lagged<br>
total gas data, lagged geological samples, a RigSense EDR Workstation, and gamma ray logging<br>
coupled with directional drilling survey data from Phoenix Technology Services. Rock cuttings<br>
were collected by H&amp;P 320 rig crews in 30' intervals throughout the vertical and build sections,<br>
and 100' intervals throughout the lateral, under the supervision of the wellsite geologists. The<br>
cuttings were then examined both wet and dried using a 10x-25x zoom binocular stereo<br>
microscope with 10x oculars. Examination of hydrocarbon cut fluorescence was conducted until<br>
the completion of the lateral well, and was described as a slow, weak, yellow green diffuse cut<br>
for the majority of the lateral, although many sections of the targeted zone showed no<br>
hydrocarbon cut fluorescence. These data, in conjunction with the previously mentioned<br>
methods, were utilized to provide Phoenix directional drillers with optimal TVD targets,<br>
ensuring a wellbore within the 14' targeted Upper Devonian Three Forks drilling interval.<br>
Prospective Pay Zones<br>
Logging and sample collection began at the base of the interbedded clastics of the Kibbey<br>
Formation (Big Snowy Group) at 8550'MD. A complete listing of sample descriptions is<br>
provided in the appendix of this report.<br>
The Charles Formation of the Mississippian Madison Group was intercepted at a true vertical<br>
depth of 8566' (-6327'). The Base of the Last Charles Salt was drilled at 9261' (-7022'), 1' higher<br>
than prognosis. This unit records a major marine regression and contains interbedded Evaporites<br>
and Limestones deposited in a restricted marine environment. Samples were described as:<br>
SALT: white to clear, transparent to translucent, hard, crystalline, no visible porosity, scattered<br>
ANHYDRITE: off white to cream, buff gray, soft to slightly firm, amorphous, chalky, slightly<br>
calcareous, no visible porosity, occasional SILTSTONE: red brown, hard to very firm, fine to<br>
very fine grained, slightly calcareous<br>
LIMESTONE: buff to light gray, medium gray, slightly mottled, firm, microcrystalline, earthy<br>

<A name=13></a>GEOLOGICAL SUMMARY &amp; CONCLUSIONS (CONT.)<br>
The Mission Canyon, also of the Madison Group, was intercepted at a true vertical depth of<br>
9473' (-7233'). This formation records a regressive sequence, and historically has produced more<br>
oil than any other lithologic unit in the Williston Basin. Samples from the Mission Canyon were<br>
described as:<br>
LIMESTONE: light gray brown to brown gray, occasional cream, tan in part, hard to firm,<br>
brittle in part, microcrystalline, lithographic, silty, carbonaceous, ANHYDRITE: white to cream,<br>
soft, calcareous, amorphous, chalky, rare visible porosity<br>
LIMESTONE: light to medium gray, cream, trace dark gray, slightly mottled in part, firm to<br>
hard, brittle to friable, microcrystalline, slightly earthy, silty, occasional anhydrite, rare visible<br>
porosity<br>
Conformably overlying the Bakken Formation, the Mississippian Lodgepole was intercepted at a<br>
true vertical depth of 9990' (-7751'). This unit typically consists of argillaceous limestones<br>
deposited in marine to restricted shelf environments. Locally, the Lodgepole exhibits potential<br>
fracture porosity and a general absence of oil staining. Samples are described as:<br>
LIMESTONE: medium to gray to gray brown, trace off white to light gray, trace dark gray,<br>
mottled in part, very firm to hard, brittle in part, microcrystalline, lithographic to slightly earthy,<br>
silty, argillaceous<br>
LIMESTONE: light gray to medium gray, firm to hard, microcrystalline, slightly earthy, silty,<br>
slightly argillaceous, slightly carbonaceous<br>
The Mississippian to Devonian Bakken Formation, although not the Frisco 2-31H1 targeted<br>
interval, has shown to be an excellent source rock for hydrocarbons within the Williston Basin.<br>
This unit is thought to record an offshore marine environment, although marine swamp<br>
paleoenvironment models have also been considered.<br>
The organic-rich Upper Shale member of the Bakken Formation was intercepted at a true vertical<br>
depth of 10763.5' (-8524.5'). This unit is characterized by a black, sub blocky to sub platy,<br>
petroliferous shale. No visible porosity was observed, but samples showed even live oil staining.<br>
Increased gas shows and a high gamma ray signature are also of note.<br>
The Lower Mississippian-Upper Devonian Middle Bakken Member was intercepted at a true<br>
vertical depth of 10776.5' (-8537.5'). Samples were described as:<br>
SILTSTONE: grey to grey brown, slightly firm to friable, argillaceous, calcareous to dolomitic,<br>
poor intergranular porosity<br>
The Devonian Lower Bakken Shale was intercepted at a true vertical depth of 10802.4' (-<br>
8563.4'). Samples in this member are similar to the Upper Bakken Shale Member, with earthy<br>
porosity, poor permeability, and light brown live even oil staining, also accompanied by a high<br>
gamma ray signature and increase in gas shows.<br>

<hr>
<A name=14></a>GEOLOGICAL SUMMARY &amp; CONCLUSIONS (CONT.)<br>
Conformably overlying the Birdbear Formation, the Devonian Three Forks carbonates were<br>
intercepted at a true vertical depth of 10808' (-8569'). While drilling the lateral portion of the<br>
Frisco 2-31H1, samples varied slightly throughout the targeted zone. The majority of the target<br>
interval, from the top of zone and down to the hot gamma peaks at markers 1 and 2:<br>
DOLOMITE: buff to light gray, cream, tan, microcrystalline, silty to argillaceous, rare fine<br>
crystalline pyrite, poor intercrystalline porosity, scattered SHALE: light blue gray, slightly blue<br>
green, sub blocky to sub platy, dolomitic<br>
A clean gamma zone, common throughout the area, was observed at the base of the target zone.<br>
Type logs suggested this zone to be slightly thicker than what was seen throughout the Frisco 2-<br>
31H1 lateral. This clean, resistant Dolomite bed was also characterized by slow drilling (down to<br>
80'/hour). Samples were described as:<br>
DOLOMITE: cream to buff, tan to light pink, occasional light gray, occasional translucent,<br>
microcrystalline, silty to argillaceous, rare disseminated pyrite, poor intercrystalline porosity,<br>
occasional SHALE: light gray to blue gray, sub blocky to sub platy, dolomitic<br>
Just below the targeted interval, where the Internal 1 Shale member of the upper Three Forks<br>
was intercepted, was described as:<br>
DOLOMITE: buff to cream, slightly orange in part, slightly translucent in part, microcrystalline,<br>
slightly sparry, silty to argillaceous, poor intercrystalline porosity, scattered SHALE: medium<br>
gray to blue gray, trace light blue gray to blue green, rare disseminated pyrite, sub blocky to sub<br>
platy, dolomitic<br>
Oil staining was rarely seen throughout the entirety of the targeted Three Forks zone and poor<br>
intergranular porosity was observed.<br>
Hydrocarbon Shows<br>
Please see the Total Gas Data section for hydrocarbon shows throughout the vertical and build<br>
section of the Frisco 2-31H1.<br>
Hydrocarbon shows steadily increased throughout the duration of the lateral portion of the Frisco<br>
2-31H1. Out of the 7&quot; intermediate casing shoe, background gas averaged around 75 units and<br>
eventually increased to a maximum background gas of 850 units at the well's total depth. The<br>
largest gas show observed within the targeted interval, 16'-30' into the first bench of the Three<br>
Forks Formation, was 1155 units at 20264'MD (~1' above the top of target zone). Also of note, a<br>
trip gas of 1995 units was observed at 17040'MD, following the trip for bottom hole assembly at<br>
17039'MD.<br>

<A name=15></a>GEOLOGICAL SUMMARY &amp; CONCLUSIONS (CONT.)<br>
GEOSTEERING<br>
Directional and MWD equipment and personnel were provided by Phoenix Technology Services<br>
for the duration of the Frisco 2-31H1. NorAm Wellsite Services wellsite geologists worked<br>
together with Phoenix crews and the Continental Resources, Inc. operations geologist to make<br>
decisions ensuring maximum wellbore exposure within the targeted zone.<br>
The potential pay zone for the Frisco 2-31H1 was determined by evaluating electric logs from<br>
offset wells in the area, including neutron density logs from the Iverson 1-31H. It was<br>
determined the ideal target would be approximately 14' thick, and begin 16' into the first bench<br>
of the Three Forks Formation, and extend to 2' above the Internal 1 Shale Member. The 90<br>
degree curve landing target was projected to be 20' below the base of the Lower Bakken Shale, in<br>
the upper-middle portion of the 14' target zone.<br>
As stated previously, data from the Frisco 1-31H and Frisco 3-31H, whose surface hole locations<br>
are situated West and East, respectively, of the Frisco 2-31H1 surface hole location, were also<br>
used as offsets. The base of the last Charles Salt and upper Lodgepole markers and formation<br>
thicknesses suggested the landing TVD for the build section be set at 10835'TVD (20' into the<br>
Three Forks, Bench 1), in accordance with prognosis. This landing target held until the Upper<br>
and Middle Bakken were intercepted 4' higher than expected, followed by the Three Forks being<br>
intercepted 7' high. The landing target was adjusted accordingly to 10828'TVD, and the bit was<br>
landed at 10830' TVD, 22' into the first bench of the Upper Devonian Three Forks formation.<br>
The gamma signature for the target zone (see figure below) was defined by two hotter peaks<br>
(~100-130 API), 5' and 8', respectively, into zone, accompanied by a basal dolomite bed<br>
exhibiting clean gamma (~60-80 API). To avoid the Pronghorn Member above and the Internal 1<br>
Shale Member below, it was necessary to keep the wellbore within the 14' targeted zone. The 2<br>
hot gamma markers in the upper-middle portion of zone as well as the clean gamma marker at<br>
the base of zone were used to interpret geologic structure throughout the Frisco 2-31H1 lateral.<br>
Electric type log from Iverson 1-31H depicting the Three Forks targeted zone.<br>

<A name=16></a>GEOLOGICAL SUMMARY &amp; CONCLUSIONS (CONT.)<br>
Based on Mission Canyon structural isopachs, thought to be conformable to the Three Forks<br>
Formation, the lateral portion of the Frisco 2-31H1 was projected to show structure down-<br>
dipping ~89.7 degrees out of the intermediate casing shoe until ~13500'MD, after which point<br>
structure was expected to gradually flatten out and turn slightly upward (~90.1 degrees) toward<br>
the end of the lateral (~18000'MD). An overall dip around 89.9 degrees was anticipated. These<br>
projections also took data from the Frisco 1-31H (north bearing horizontal Middle Bakken well<br>
west of Frisco 2-31H1) and the Iverson 1-31H (vertical well northeast of Frisco 2-31H1 surface<br>
hole location) into account.<br>
After drilling out of the 7" intermediate casing shoe, formation generally followed Mission<br>
Canyon structural isopachs in the area, dipping an average of 89.7 degrees, until formation<br>
turned over to ~90.4 around 16000'MD. Structure exhibited a general upward trend (averaging<br>
90.3 degrees) until 18500'MD, where it flattened out to ~90 degrees. Formation held close to flat<br>
for ~1800', briefly rolling over (~89.8 degrees) until the well's total depth (20595'MD,<br>
10843.3'TVD). The overall apparent formation dip was calculated at 89.8 degrees, with a TVD<br>
gain of -18' over the course of the lateral well.<br>
NorAm Wellsite Services was released following getting bottoms up lagged gas readings after<br>
setting production liner.<br>

<A name=17></a>GEOLOGICAL SUMMARY &amp; CONCLUSIONS (CONT.)<br>
SUMMARY<br>
1. The Frisco 2-31H1 is a Three Forks horizontal well spudded with H&amp;P320 on December 1,<br>
2014, and was successfully drilled in the Grass Bluff Field in 7 days, reaching a total depth of<br>
20595'MD at 17:50 CST on December 15, 2014.<br>
2. The wellbore was within the targeted zone 88% of the 9287', 7 day lateral well, exposing a<br>
total of 8183' of open hole within the prospective pay zone.<br>
3. Diesel based invert drilling fluid during the vertical and curve build sections, and salt water<br>
based brine during the lateral, maintained stable hole conditions and permitted adequate analysis<br>
of gas concentrations.<br>
4. Samples throughout the course of the lateral varied from a grey, cream, and tan (top of target<br>
zone down to gamma marker 2) to a cream, light pink, and translucent (clean dolomite bed just<br>
above internal 1 shale), microcrystalline, silty, argillaceous Dolomite with disseminated pyrite<br>
throughout and poor intercrystalline porosity, interbedded with light blue grey to blue green, sub<br>
blocky, sub platy, dolomitic Shale. Pyrite was most abundant closest to the Pronghorn Member<br>
of the upper Three Forks.<br>
5. Background gas values consistently increased throughout the lateral, starting around 50 units<br>
(average connection gas 80 units) out of the intermediate casing shoe, eventually averaging 850<br>
units (average connection gas 900 units) by the well's total depth. The highest gas show observed<br>
was 1155 units at 20264'MD, ~1' above the top of the 14' targeted interval.<br>
6. Geosteering and borehole guidance were accomplished with the aid of lagged total gas data,<br>
lagged geological samples, a RigSense EDR Workstation, and gamma ray logging coupled with<br>
directional drilling survey data from Phoenix Technology Services. The overall apparent dip of<br>
the Frisco 2-31H1 was approximately 89.8 degrees.<br>
7. The Frisco 2-31H1 is currently awaiting completion operations.<br>

Well File # 29303<br>
Dear Becky:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 22091, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is<br>
granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' </span><span class="ft1">setback from<br>
the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' </span><span class="ft1">setback from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting<br>
of Sections 30 &amp; 31 T152N R102W. </span><span class="ft3">Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock<br>
disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during<br>
clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. Due to drainage adjacent to<br>
the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location.<br>
CONTINENTAL RESOURCES must contact<br>
NDIC Field Inspector Caitlin Simpkins at 701-770-9609 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and<br>
completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of<br>
the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be<br>
inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized<br>
in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate<br>
from the well head is: 9960'N.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved<br>
drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd<br>
business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.<br>
Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating<br>
circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that would allow the Director to<br>
conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given immediately<br>
upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The<br>
following information must be included:<br>
Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company<br>
representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time.<br>
Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall<br>
file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be<br>
submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional<br>
survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a<br>
timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a certification cover page to<br>
certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when<br>
sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is hereby<br>
granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing on the date the<br>
well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well records wherever<br>
located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall permit the Director and his<br>
representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or controlled by them, complying with all<br>
safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to have access at all times to any and all records of<br>
wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such<br>
wells shall be made available to them at any time upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be<br>
maintained in strict confidence and shall be available only to the Commission and its staff.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail<br>
cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or<br>
initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>

Re:<br>
Continental Resources standard CCL, CBL, 4-1/2" liner running and testing procedures<br>
Continental Resources' standard practice for running the cement bond log and casing<br>
caliper log is to run both logs immediately after coming out of the hole after TD, prior to running<br>
the 4-1/2" liner, to the deepest depth obtainable; however, if there are well control concerns that<br>
require us to run the liner sooner, only the CBL will be run and the CCL will be run after setting<br>
the liner.<br>
Based on the CCL results, we determine the actual API minimum burst allowance for the 7"<br>
casing. If the downgraded API burst pressure is below our minimum required frac pressures, we<br>
will run a 4-1/2" frac string; if severe wear or holes are found in the casing, we will run a 5"<br>
cemented, to surface, tie back string.<br>
The CBL log is run in order to determine the top of cement, as required by the NDIC.<br>
Our current 4-1/2" liner program for a 1280 unit is 30, evenly spaced, stages with 29 swellable<br>
packers. The liner shoe is set approximately 180 feet off bottom. The shoe stage below the last<br>
packer has 2 joints, a double valved float, one joint, and a ported guide shoe ­ appx 130 ft. The<br>
liner is run using a running tool on the end of 4" DP. The 7" packer/hanger is set about 40 ft<br>
above KOP between two casing collars but conditions occasionally occur that require setting<br>
higher, either through unexpected failure or in order to isolate casing wear close to KOP.<br>
Recently we have tried 40 stage liners and the trend to explore the optimum stage count will<br>
continue.. Once the liner is at depth, a ball is dropped through the DP, the ball is pressured up<br>
against the setting tool to approximately 2500 psi, and the 7" packer/hanger is set.<br>
A push pull test is done to confirm the hanger has set. Then, a 4500 psi pressure test is<br>
completed on the back side of the 4" DP to confirm the packer has set. The setting tool is then<br>
backed off and the 4" DP/running tool is laid down.<br>
Immediately after the rotary rig has been moved off the well location, the 7" csg and liner<br>
packer/ hanger are tested to the frac pressure. The testers will rig up and test the tubing head to<br>
5000 psi. Next a test plug will be run and set, using wire line, in the top of the 7" packer/hanger.<br>
Testers will pressure up to our frac pressure, typically 8500 psi, to confirm the 7" is ready for<br>
completion.<br>

INTRODUCTION<br>
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 7T2 [Lot 2 Section 19,<br>
T153N, R100W] is located approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston in McKenzie<br>
County, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 7T2 is a horizontal Three Forks second bench<br>
well within the Williston Basin consisting of one 9,557' lateral drilled toward the east. The<br>
vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,368'. The curve would be built at 12<br>
degrees per 100' to land within the Three Forks. This well is a two section lateral which<br>
originates in the northwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the northeast quarter of<br>
section 20. Directional drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the<br>
Three Forks reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.<br>
<hr>
<A name=4></a>OFFSET WELLS<br>
Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the `Control<br>
Data' section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to<br>
successfully land within the Three Forks. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray<br>
signatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in<br>
order to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was<br>
periodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.<br>
GEOLOGY<br>
The Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 8,535' MD 8,534' TVD (-<br>
6,458' SS). Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation consisted of a limestone<br>
mudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, off white in color. It was microcrystalline,<br>
friable, laminated, with an earthy texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity, as was rare spotty<br>
light brown oil stain Occasionally noted was a dolomite mudstone, which was light brown, light<br>
gray brown in color. It was microcrystalline, friable-firm, laminated, with an earthy texture. Also<br>
noted was a trace of intercrystalline porosity, and occasional spotty light brown oil stain. Rarely<br>
noted was anhydrite, which was off white, cream in color. It was soft, microcrystalline, and<br>
massive with an earthy to amorphous texture. Following connections or periods of non-<br>
circulation, gas peaks of 49 to 56 units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 30 to 59 units</span><span class="ft3">.<br>
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,430' MD 9,429'<br>
TVD (-7,353' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was<br>
described as light gray, light brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime mudstone<br>
was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some intervals<br>
contained a trace of black-brown algal material, a trace of fossil fragments, and traces of<br>
disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light<br>
gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The<br>
argillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture.<br>
Some intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. Following connections or periods of<br>
non-circulation, gas peaks of 57 to 125 units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 58 to 130<br>
units. Rare intercrystalline porosity was noted as well as traces to occasional spotty light brown<br>
oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission Canyon Formation.<br>

<A name=5></a>The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,767' MD<br>
10,724' TVD (-8,648' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated<br>
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and<br>
petroliferous shale was hard with a splintery to smooth texture. Fracture porosity was noted, and<br>
trace minerals were observed to include disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill.<br>
Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 357 units drilling gas, with a<br>
directional survey gas of 435 units.<br>
The Middle Bakken Member [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,792'<br>
MD 10,740' TVD (-8,664' SS). Samples in the Middle Bakken Member were predominantly silty<br>
sandstone which was described as light gray brown, light brown, trace light gray in color. It was<br>
very fine grained, friable, subround, smooth, moderately sorted, with calcite cement, moderately<br>
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was fair intergranular<br>
porosity. Also noted was occasional light brown spotty oil stain. Hydrocarbons evaluated in this<br>
interval reached a maximum of 403 units drilling gas, with a directional survey gas of 314 units.<br>
The Lower Bakken Shale [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,864' MD 10,782'<br>
TVD (-8,706' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by high gamma, elevated<br>
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black, black gray shale is<br>
petroliferous, hard, splintery, smooth and exhibits possible fracture porosity. Trace minerals<br>
included disseminated pyrite.<br>
The<br>
Pronghorn<br>
Member<br>
[Devonian-Bakken<br>
Formation] was reached at 10,883' MD 10,790'<br>
TVD (-8,714' SS). Entry into this interval was<br>
characterized by lower gamma then the Lower<br>
Bakken Shale, and slightly slower penetration<br>
rates.<br>
Samples<br>
from<br>
the<br>
Pronghorn<br>
were<br>
described as siltstone which was dark gray trace<br>
gray black, friable to firm, subblocky to subsplit.<br>
This<br>
siltstone<br>
was<br>
moderately<br>
dolomite<br>
cemented and included disseminated and nodular<br>
pyrite. Also noted was a trace of spotty light<br>
brown oil stain. Drilling gas in this interval<br>
reached a maximum of 322 units with a<br>
directional survey gas of 669 units.<br>

The Three Forks Formation [Devonian] was reached at 10,918' MD 10,810' TVD (-8,734') SS.<br>
Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower penetration rates.<br>
Samples from the predominately dolomitic Three Forks were described as mudstone, which was<br>
light brown to light brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink gray in color. It was firm, laminated, with<br>
a microsucrosic texture, and contained rare disseminated pyrite. It contained occasional<br>
intercrystalline porosity, and a trace of spotty light brown oil stain. Thinly bedded with the<br>
<hr>
<A name=6></a>dolomite was light green to light gray green shale which was firm, subblocky, with an earthy<br>
texture. Occasional disseminated pyrite and possible intergranular porosity were also noted.<br>
The Three Forks second bench [Devonian] was reached at 11,043' MD 10,853' TVD (-8,777') SS<br>
which was -5' low to Chalmers 5300 21-19 8T. The target zone of the Three Forks was to be<br>
drilled in a predominately dolomite twenty two foot zone beginning four feet into the Three<br>
Forks second bench formation.<br>
Samples in the Three Forks second bench were predominantly dolomite which was described as<br>
peach pink-buff, rare light brown, trace light gray brown pink in color. It was very fine<br>
crystalline, firm, with a sucrosic texture. A trace of disseminated pyrite was noted as was<br>
occasional intercrystalline porosity. Also noted was rare spotty light brown oil stain. Also<br>
observed was light green, light gray green shale that was firm, with an earthy texture. A trace of<br>
disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.<br>

Hydrocarbon Shows<br>
Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during<br>
the drilling of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 7T2. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples<br>
were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained<br>
near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the<br>
Chalmers 5300 21-19 7T2 varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which<br>
may have reflected increased porosity. During the vertical, connection gas peaks of 40 to 125<br>
units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 15 to 130 units, against a 9.8-11.1 lb/gal diesel-<br>
invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 24 to 130 units, against<br>
a 9.7-10 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Connection peaks of 75 to 300 units were observed,<br>
coinciding with the best shows. A trip at 15,319' MD' yielded a trip gas of 138 units.<br>
Chromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations of methane, characteristic of Three Forks<br>
gas.<br>

Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling<br>
(MWD) services. The RP directional drillers and MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel<br>
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to<br>
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of<br>
the formation.<br>
The 862' curve was drilled in 18 hours with a bottom hole assembly (BHA) consisting of bit #4,<br>
a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV 7/8 6.4 motor and MWD<br>
tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,230' MD and 10,873' TVD, approximately 20'<br>
into the Three Forks second bench formation. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 casing was set<br>
to 11,170' MD.<br>
Geologic structure maps of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 7T2 and surrounding control wells had<br>
estimated formation dip to be a down dip at approximately -0.5º down to the TD of the lateral.<br>
The preferred drilling interval of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 7T2 consisted of a twenty two foot<br>
zone located approximately four feet into the Three Forks second bench formation. Penetration<br>
rates, gas shows, gamma ray data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in<br>
the preferred stratigraphic position in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis<br>
representatives, projected porosity zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.<br>
Figure 8. Offset Well Target Definition, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).<br>
Steering decisions were made by using target points and letter markers provided by Oasis<br>
personnel. As the well-bore moved through formation the letter markers were identified and the<br>
well-bore was guided accordingly. Near the top of marker (B) there appeared to be a tight streak<br>
that would deflect the well-bore when encountered. Due to these deflections the well-bore did<br>
not move above this marker. Another tight streak located near marker (D) tended to deflect the<br>
well-bore up when encountered at low angles of approach. The well-bore was able to penetrate<br>
this tight streak a few times during the drilling, and marker (E) was noted. At one point the well-<br>
bore moved below marker (E) into the underlying second claystone moving toward marker (F)<br>
before being maneuvered back up into the target zone. Samples collected higher in the target<br>
<hr>
<A name=9></a>zone near marker (B) tended to have a greater concentration of the off white to light gray, gray<br>
brown dolomite than did samples collected lower in formation. The TD of 20,727' MD was<br>
achieved at 23:50 hours CT December 20, 2014. The well site team worked together to maintain<br>
the well bore in the desired target interval for 97% of the lateral, opening 9,557' of potentially<br>
productive reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The Chalmers 5300 21-19 7T2 is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum's horizontal Three Forks<br>
development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD in 20<br>
days. The TD of 20,727' MD was achieved at 23:50 hours CT December 20, 2014. The well site<br>
team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval for 97% of the<br>
lateral, opening 9,557' of potentially productive reservoir rock.<br>
Samples in the Three Forks second bench were predominantly dolomite which was described as<br>
peach pink-buff, rare light brown, trace light gray brown pink in color. It was very fine<br>
crystalline, firm, with a sucrosic texture. A trace of disseminated pyrite was noted as was<br>
occasional intercrystalline porosity. Also noted was rare spotty light brown oil stain. Also<br>
observed was light green, light gray green shale that was firm, with an earthy texture. A trace of<br>
disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.<br>
Gas on the Chalmers 5300 21-19 7T2 varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration<br>
rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon shows were<br>
encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Three Forks.<br>
The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Chalmers 5300 21-19 7T2 awaits completion<br>
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.<br>

Rig crews caught 30' sample intervals, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, from 8,240' to the<br>
TD of the lateral at 20,727'. Formation tops and lithologic markers have been inserted into the sample<br>
descriptions below for reference. Sample descriptions begin in the Kibbey Formation just prior to the<br>
Kibbey Lime. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. Sample fluorescent<br>
cuts are masked by invert mud through intermediate casing. Quantifiers in order of increasing abundance<br>
are trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant.<br>

McKenzie County<br>
Well File # 28635<br>
Dear Brandi:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft4">500' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft4">200' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the<br>
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 19 &amp; 20 T153N R100W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must<br>
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are<br>
conducted. Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the<br>
entire location. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-<br>
770-3554 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum<br>
legal coordinate from the well head is: 9971' east.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft1">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft4">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>
Assistant Director<br>

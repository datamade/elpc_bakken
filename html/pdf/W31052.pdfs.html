NWNE Section 16-149N-98W<br>
McKenzie County<br>
Well File # 31052<br>
Dear Shawn:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24592, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is<br>
granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' </span><span class="ft1">setback from<br>
the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' </span><span class="ft1">setback from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting<br>
of Sections 16 &amp; 21 T149N R98W. </span><span class="ft3">Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock<br>
disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during<br>
clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. Due to drainage adjacent to<br>
the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location. WHITING OIL AND GAS CORP must contact<br>
NDIC Field Inspector Joyce Kohut at 701-202-1288 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and<br>
completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of<br>
the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be<br>
inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized<br>
in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate<br>
from the well head is: 9974'S.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved<br>
drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd<br>
business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.<br>
Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating<br>
circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that would allow the Director to<br>
conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that<br>
notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas<br>
Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,<br>
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00<br>
p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a<br>
certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as<br>
one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be<br>
filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner.<br>
Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when<br>
sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Conductors, Rat holes, and Mouse holes <br>
To protect near surface groundwater any conductor, rat, or mouse hole drilled must be constructed with a string of casing <br>
and cemented to ground level.  Any such string must be secured at the surface when not in use.  In addition, all rat and mouse <br>
holes must be plugged with cement and cut off at least 4' below final grade within a reasonable timeframe after the rig completes <br>
drilling operations on the pad. <br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail<br>
cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or<br>
initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the<br>
well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS<br>
(log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>

PRESSURE CONTROL EQUIPMENT<br>
A. Type:<br>
Eleven (11) inch double gate hydraulic BOP with eleven (11) inch annular preventer<br>
with 5,000 psi Casinghead and 5,000 psi Tubinghead.<br>
B. Testing Procedure:<br>
The annular preventer will be pressure tested to 50% of stack rated working pressure for ten (10)<br>
minutes or until provisions of test are met, whichever is longer. The BOP, choke manifold, and<br>
related equipment will be pressure tested to approved BOP stack working pressure (if isolated from<br>
surface casing by a test plug) or to 70% of surface casing internal yield strength (if BOP is not<br>
isolated by a test plug). Pressure will be maintained for ten (10) minutes or until the requirements of<br>
the test are met, whichever is longer. At a minimum, the Annular and Blow-Out Preventer pressure<br>
tests will be performed:<br>
1.<br>
When the BOPE is initially installed;<br>
2.<br>
Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken;<br>
3.<br>
Following related repairs; and<br>
4.<br>
At thirty (30) day intervals.<br>
Annular will be function tested weekly, and pipe &amp; blind rams activated each trip, but not more than<br>
once per day. All BOP drills &amp; tests will be recorded in IADC driller's log.<br>
C. Choke Manifold Equipment:<br>
All choke lines will be straight lines whenever possible at turns, tee blocks will be used or will be<br>
targeted with running tees, and will be anchored to prevent whip and vibration.<br>
D. Accumulator:<br>
Accumulator will have sufficient capacity to open hydraulically-controlled choke line valve (if so<br>
equipped), close all rams plus annular preventer, and retain a minimum of 200 psi above precharge on<br>
the closing manifold without the use of closing unit pumps. The fluid reservoir capacity will be<br>
double accumulator capacity and the fluid level will be maintained at manufacturer's<br>
recommendations. Accumulator precharge pressure test will be conducted prior to connecting the<br>
closing unit to the BOP stack.<br>
E. Miscellaneous Information:<br>
Choke manifold and BOP extension rods with hand wheels will be located outside rig sub-structure.<br>
Hydraulic BOP closing unit will be located at least twenty-five (25) feet from the wellhead but readily<br>
accessible to the driller. Exact locations and configurations of the hydraulic BOP closing unit will<br>
depend upon the particular rig contracted to drill this hole.<br>
A flare line will be installed after the choke manifold with the discharge point of the flare line to a<br>
separate pit located at least 125 feet away from the wellbore and any existing production facilities.<br>

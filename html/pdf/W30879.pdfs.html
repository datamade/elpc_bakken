Well File # 30879<br>
Dear Shawn:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23328, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft4">500' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the north &amp; south boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 18 &amp;<br>
19 T147N R91W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must<br>
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are<br>
conducted. WHITING OIL AND GAS CORP must contact NDIC Field Inspector Ashleigh Day at 701-<br>
290-3277 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing<br>
point is: 48' north. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the<br>
well head is: 9580' north.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft1">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft4">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>

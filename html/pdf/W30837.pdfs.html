Well File # 30837<br>
Dear Shawn:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 25007, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is granted on the<br>
condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' </span><span class="ft1">setback from the north &amp; south boundaries<br>
and </span><span class="ft3">500' </span><span class="ft1">setback from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 27 &amp; 34 T155N R99W. </span><span class="ft3">Tool<br>
error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be<br>
maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-<br>
back whenever filtration operations are conducted.<br>
In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an<br>
affidavit must be provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property of the<br>
cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling unit. Whiting may set conductor on permitted wells<br>
only. Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location. WHITING OIL AND GAS<br>
CORP must contact NDIC Field Inspector Jessica Gilkey at 701-770-7340 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion<br>
operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and<br>
freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized<br>
representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director<br>
prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The proposed directional<br>
plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is: 560'N. Also, based on the azimuth of the<br>
proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 10717'N.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit<br>
on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following<br>
publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn<br>
affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and<br>
any other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit,<br>
the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that notification be given<br>
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The<br>
following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and<br>
time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-<br>
8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a certified copy<br>
of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a<br>
form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the<br>
survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one<br>
adobe document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90<br>
feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement<br>
utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones<br>
can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the<br>
presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production<br>
or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as<br>
one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a<br>
standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

EVALUATION PROGRAM<br>
Logs<br>
: The logging program will be run by Schlumberger and will consist of their<br>
Platform Express plus BHC Sonic from 11593</span><span class="ft3">' </span><span class="ft0">to 2470</span><span class="ft3">'</span><span class="ft0">. The Gamma Ray<br>
and resistivity log will be pulled back to surface.<br>
The evaluation program may change at the discretion of the well site geologist.<br>
COMPLETION<br>
The planned top of the 4.5" 11.6" production liner will be 50-100 ft above the kick off point.<br>
This liner will be cemented throughout the lateral and a wet shoe sub will be set at the toe of the<br>
liner. The frac string will be 12.75# P-110 with TSHP threads and stung into a PBR run with the<br>
liner hanger prior to the fracturing treatment. Current plans are for 28 stages using a plug and<br>
perf approach.<br>
No diesel fuels, as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency<br>
(USEPA), will be used in the hydraulic fracturing of this well.<br>
USEPA identifies diesel fuels as any compound identified with the following Chemical<br>
Abstract Service Registry Numbers:<br>
68334-30-5 (Primary Name: Fuels, diesel)<br>
68476-34-6 (Primary Name: Fuels, diesel, No. 2)<br>

8/21/2014<br>
Estimated 1st Production: 4 wells 1/1/16 &amp; 4 wells 3/1/16<br>
Flowback Strategy: Gas pipeline installation prior to flow back operations. 4 wells will be completed at a time. Each well will be<br>
flowed through flowback test units for 3-7 days per well for wellbore clean up, then turned to permanent<br>
production facilities. Two flow back test units will be used on the set of 4 wells. Gas will be sold from the<br>
flow back test units with the aid of gas coolers. Individual well IP rates should average 1 MMCFPD per well<br>
for 3-7 days, and 0.67 MMCFPD average for 1st Month. Maximum total pad gas production 3.5 MMCFPD,<br>
and 3 MMCFPD average for 1st Month. When 2nd set of 4 wells are completed maximum will be<br>
4.5MMCFPD.<br>
Gathering Information<br>
Gas Gatherer: ONEOK<br>
Address:<br>
100 W. Fifth Street Tulsa, OK 74103<br>
Processing Plant Name: Stateline<br>
Location:<br>
SEC10-T155N-R102W<br>
Current Daily Capacity: 200 MMCFPD<br>
Anticipated Daily Capacity:<br>
200 MMCFPD<br>
Current Throughput: 180 MMCFPD<br>
Anticipated Throughput:<br>
170 MMCFPD (including all 8 wells)<br>
Tie-in point: Existing 14&quot; gathering line is near to location.<br>
Expansion Plans: A new 30MM compressor station will be coming on end of 2014. 50MMCFPD additional compression 6-<br>
2015. The Stateline facility is currently taking approximately 50 MMCFPD from McKenzie County.<br>
Additional capacity will be available when this gas is diverted back when the Garden Creek Plant II (100MM,<br>
Q3 2014), and Garden Creek III (100MM, Q1 2015) as they are put online. Garden Creek plants are near<br>
Watford City. ONEOK will balance capacity between plants.<br>

Current Flaring Information:<br>
Field:<br>
Stockyard Creek<br>
Field Flare%:<br>
20% (Jun-14)<br>
North Dakota Flare %:<br>
30% (Jun-14)<br>
Alternatives to Flaring: This location will be connected to pipeline prior to production. Flaring will be reduced, when required, by<br>
utilizing NGL recovery units, natural gas generators, and to run other equipment. Gas coolers are also<br>
utilized to cool the temperature of the initial gas production that is above the temperature of the pipeline<br>
specification, so it can be sold. Currently, Kodiak Oil and Gas has NGL recovery in place and operating on 24<br>
Wells (6 Pads) where pipeline has been delayed due to ROW issues. In addition, Kodiak has contracted 2<br>
drilling rigs in Q3 2014 that can run on dry natural gas that is a product of the NGL recovery effort.<br>
Additional measures to limit flaring will include scheduling wellwork and initial production testing to limit<br>
peak gas production.<br>

SWSW Section 32-150N-104W<br>
McKenzie County<br>
Well File # 30118<br>
Dear Scott :<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 22722, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is<br>
granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' setback </span><span class="ft1">from<br>
the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 640 acre spacing unit consisting<br>
of All Sections 30 &amp; 31-T150N-104W. </span><span class="ft3">Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock<br>
disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during<br>
clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. THIS WELL IS LOCATED<br>
ON AN AQUIFER: AN ONSITE INSPECTION IS REQUIRED. CONTACT NDIC FIELD INSPECTOR<br>
FOR SITE SPECIFIC STIPULATIONS TO INCLUDE BUT NOT LIMITED TO: CLOSED MUD SYSTEM,<br>
NO DRILLING PIT, IMPERMEABLE LINER IS REQUIRED UNDER THE DRILLING RIG AND A<br>
STRING OF CASING MUST BE PLACED IN THE RAT &amp; MOUSE HOLE CEMENTED TO GROUND<br>
LEVEL. FURTHERMORE, WHITING MUST PLACE A LINER UNDER ANY ADDITIONAL TANKAGE<br>
NEEDED FOR THE PRODUCTION FACILITY. ALSO, DUE TO THE PROXIMITY TO THE MISSOURI<br>
RIVER, A PERIMETER LOCATION DIKE IS REQUIRED. IN ADDITION, AUTOMATIC SHUTOFFS ARE<br>
REQUIRED ON ALL EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS HIGH/LOW INDICATORS ON ALL TANKS. LASTLY,<br>
WHITING OIL AND GAS CORP must contact NDIC Field Inspector Caitlin Simpkins at 701-770-9609 to set up<br>
an on-site prior to setting conductor.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and<br>
completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of<br>
the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be<br>
inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized<br>
in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is: 700W.<br>
Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 9879N &amp; 700W.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved<br>
drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd<br>
business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.<br>
Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating<br>
circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that would allow the Director to<br>
conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that<br>
notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas<br>
Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,<br>
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00<br>
p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a<br>
certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as<br>
one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be<br>
filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner.<br>
Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft2">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when<br>
sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail<br>
cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or<br>
initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>

PRESSURE CONTROL EQUIPMENT<br>
A. Type:<br>
Eleven (11) inch double gate hydraulic BOP with eleven (11) inch annular preventer<br>
with 5,000 psi Casinghead and 5,000 psi Tubinghead.<br>
B. Testing Procedure:<br>
The annular preventer will be pressure tested to 50% of stack rated working pressure for ten (10)<br>
minutes or until provisions of test are met, whichever is longer. The BOP, choke manifold, and<br>
related equipment will be pressure tested to approved BOP stack working pressure (if isolated from<br>
surface casing by a test plug) or to 70% of surface casing internal yield strength (if BOP is not<br>
isolated by a test plug). Pressure will be maintained for ten (10) minutes or until the requirements of<br>
the test are met, whichever is longer. At a minimum, the Annular and Blow-Out Preventer pressure<br>
tests will be performed:<br>
1.<br>
When the BOPE is initially installed;<br>
2.<br>
Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken;<br>
3.<br>
Following related repairs; and<br>
4.<br>
At thirty (30) day intervals.<br>
Annular will be function tested weekly, and pipe &amp; blind rams activated each trip, but not more than<br>
once per day. All BOP drills &amp; tests will be recorded in IADC driller's log.<br>
C. Choke Manifold Equipment:<br>
All choke lines will be straight lines whenever possible at turns, tee blocks will be used or will be<br>
targeted with running tees, and will be anchored to prevent whip and vibration.<br>
D. Accumulator:<br>
Accumulator will have sufficient capacity to open hydraulically-controlled choke line valve (if so<br>
equipped), close all rams plus annular preventer, and retain a minimum of 200 psi above precharge on<br>
the closing manifold without the use of closing unit pumps. The fluid reservoir capacity will be<br>
double accumulator capacity and the fluid level will be maintained at manufacturer's<br>
recommendations. Accumulator precharge pressure test will be conducted prior to connecting the<br>
closing unit to the BOP stack.<br>
E. Miscellaneous Information:<br>
Choke manifold and BOP extension rods with hand wheels will be located outside rig sub-structure.<br>
Hydraulic BOP closing unit will be located at least twenty-five (25) feet from the wellhead but readily<br>
accessible to the driller. Exact locations and configurations of the hydraulic BOP closing unit will<br>
depend upon the particular rig contracted to drill this hole.<br>
This well will be drilled from an existing pad location. A production facility is in-place and a gas tie-<br>

1.1<br>
Regulatory Overview [40 CFR 112.1; 40 CFR 112.7; 40 CFR 112.9]<br>
In January of 1974, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) adopted 40 CFR Part 112 as the<br>
Oil Pollution Prevention Program, which was most recently amended on November 13, 2009.<br>
These oil pollution prevention regulations require the preparation of a Spill Prevention Control<br>
and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan for facilities engaged in drilling, producing, gathering,<br>
storing, processing, refining, transferring, distributing, using, or consuming oil and oil products,<br>
and which due to their location, could reasonably be expected to discharge oil in harmful<br>
quantities into or upon the navigable waters of the United States (40 CFR Part 112.1(b)).<br>
The regulation has several specific exemptions:<br>
· Any equipment or facilities that are subject to the authority of the U.S. Department of<br>
Transportation, the U.S. Department of the Interior, or the Minerals Management Service.<br>
· Any facility with a completely buried storage capacity of 42,000 gallons or less of oil and<br>
an aggregate aboveground storage capacity of 1,320 gallons or less of oil.<br>
The<br>
completely buried storage capacity excludes the following: tanks that are subject to 40<br>
CFR Part 280 or Part 281, tanks that supply emergency diesel generators at nuclear<br>
power generation facilities, and any container with a capacity of less than 55 gallons of<br>
oil. The aggregate aboveground capacity excludes the following: permanently closed<br>
containers, motive power containers, hot-mix asphalt containers, containers for heating<br>
oil used solely at a single-family residence, pesticide application equipment and related<br>
mix containers, and any container with a capacity of less than 55 gallons of oil.<br>
· Any facility or part thereof used exclusively for wastewater treatment.<br>
· Any intra-facility gathering lines subject to 49 CFR Part 192 or Part 195.<br>
The owner or operator of a SPCC-regulated facility is required to prepare a written, site-specific<br>
spill prevention plan, which details how a facility's operations comply with the requirements of<br>
40 CFR Part 112. The November 13, 2009, regulations state that plans must be completed by<br>
November 10, 2010.<br>
An amendment to the rule has extended the compliance and<br>
implementation date to November 10, 2011. To be in compliance, the facility's SPCC plan must<br>
satisfy all of the applicable requirements for drainage, bulk storage tanks, tank car and truck<br>
loading and unloading, transfer operations (intra-facility piping), inspections and records, and<br>
training. Most importantly, the facility must fully implement the SPCC plan and train personnel<br>
in its execution.<br>
The content of this SPCC Plan has been prepared in accordance with good engineering practices<br>
to prevent and mitigate damage to the environment from a potential oil spill. This plan does not<br>
serve as a site safety or regulatory compliance audit.<br>
The Plan is certified by a registered<br>
Professional Engineer and has the full approval of Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation (WOGC)<br>
management at a level with authority to commit the necessary resources to implement the Plan.<br>

SPCC Plan<br>
Kuykendall 34-31-1H<br>
March 2013<br>
<hr>
<A name=53></a>This Plan is designed to satisfy the requirements of the 2002 rule revision and the following<br>
2006, 2008 and 2009 amendments.<br>
In 1993, the SPCC regulations were expanded to require the preparation and submittal of<br>
contingency plans for all facilities that can cause &quot;substantial harm&quot; due to potential oil spills.<br>
Each owner/operator is to review the EPA's guidelines in determining whether the facility meets<br>
the applicable substantial harm criteria, and if necessary, prepare a contingency plan in<br>
accordance with 40 CFR Part 112.20.<br>
This SPCC Plan is supported by three appendices:<br>
· Appendix A Tables<br>
· Appendix B Procedures<br>
· Appendix C Spill Trailer Equipment Lists and Contacts<br>
1.2<br>
Regulatory Requirements for Production Facility [40 CFR 112.7(a)(1); 40 CFR<br>
112.9(a)]<br>
WOGC maintains oil and gas production wells in McKenzie County, North Dakota. WOGC is<br>
required by 40 CFR Part 112 to develop and implement a SPCC Plan for these facilities. Each<br>
facility has a total aboveground oil storage capacity exceeding 1,320 gallons and could<br>
reasonably be expected to discharge oil in harmful quantities into or upon the navigable waters<br>
of the United States. Oil management activities at the facilities include wellhead production,<br>
liquids separation, and storage. This document is intended to satisfy the requirements for a<br>
SPCC plan for production facilities as set forth in 40 CFR Part 112.<br>
1.3<br>
Plan Review and Amendment [40 CFR 112.4; 40 CFR 112.5]<br>
A responsible official of WOGC will review and evaluate this SPCC Plan at least once every five<br>
years. As a result of this review, non-technical changes will be made to the plan to ensure that<br>
the document is current and up-to-date.<br>
Such non-technical changes may include updating<br>
contact names, phone numbers, or addresses, and these changes do not require recertification by<br>
a Professional Engineer. In addition to non-technical changes, this SPCC Plan will be amended<br>
within six months of the review to include more effective prevention and control technology if<br>
the technology has been field-proven at the time of the review and will significantly reduce the<br>
likelihood of a discharge. Any such amendment will be implemented as soon as possible, but not<br>
later than six months after the amendment. This 5-year management review will be documented<br>
on Table 1 in Appendix A.<br>
In addition to the general 5-year review, this SPCC Plan shall be amended and recertified by a<br>
Professional Engineer within six months after any change in facility design, construction,<br>
operation, or maintenance that materially affects the facility's potential to discharge oil.<br>
Examples of changes that may require amendment of the Plan include, but are not limited to:<br>
· commissioning or decommissioning containers;<br>

· reconstruction, replacement, or installation of piping systems;<br>
· construction or demolition that might alter secondary containment structures;<br>
· changes of product or service; or<br>
· revision of standard operation or maintenance procedures at the facilities.<br>
In addition, the EPA or the State oil pollution control agency may require that this SPCC Plan be<br>
amended following reportable spills (40 CFR Part 112.4). As required, any such non-five-year-<br>
review amendments to this SPCC Plan shall be noted on Table 1 in Appendix A of this SPCC<br>
Plan.<br>
All technical (non-administrative) changes and amendments to this SPCC Plan require the Plan<br>
to be reviewed by a Professional Engineer. Following such a review, a new certification page<br>
will be signed, sealed, and inserted into this plan to complete the amendment process.<br>

Conformance with State Requirements [40 CFR 112.7(j); NDAC 43-02-03-30.1;<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-49; NDAC 43-02-03-53]<br>
At no time shall any spill or leak be allowed to flow over, pool, or rest on the surface of the land<br>
or infiltrate the soil. Discharge fluids must be properly removed and may not be allowed to<br>
remain standing within or outside of diked areas, although the remediation of such fluids may be<br>
allowed onsite if approved by the director. Operators must respond with appropriate resources to<br>
contain and clean up spills.<br>
Storage of oil in underground or partially buried tanks or containers is prohibited. Surface oil<br>
tanks and production equipment must be devoid of leaks and in good condition. Unused tanks<br>
and production equipment must be removed from the site or placed into service, within a<br>
reasonable time period, not to exceed one year.<br>
Dikes must be erected and maintained around oil tanks at any production facility built or rebuilt<br>
on or after July 1, 2000. Dikes must be erected around oil tanks at any new production facility<br>
within thirty days after the well has been completed. Dikes must be erected and maintained<br>
around oil tanks at production facilities built prior to July 1, 2000, when deemed necessary by<br>
the director. Dikes as well as the base material under the dikes and within the diked area must be<br>
constructed of sufficiently impermeable material to provide emergency containment. Dikes must<br>
be of sufficient dimension to contain the total capacity of the largest tank plus one day's fluid<br>
production. The required capacity of the dike may be lowered by the director if the necessity<br>
therefor can be demonstrated to the director's satisfaction.<br>
Numbered metal security seals shall be properly utilized on all oil access valves and access<br>
points to secure the tank or battery of tanks.<br>

processed, stored, and disposed of without pollution of freshwater supplies. Underground<br>
injection of saltwater liquids and brines shall be in accordance with NDAC Chapter 43-02-05.<br>
Surface facilities are acceptable provided that:<br>
· They are devoid of leaks and constructed of materials resistant to the effects of produced<br>
saltwater liquids, brines, or chemicals that may be contained therein. The above materials<br>
requirement may be waived by the director for tanks presently in service and in good<br>
condition. Unused tanks and injection equipment must be removed from the site or placed<br>
into service, within a reasonable time period, not to exceed one year.<br>
· Dikes must be erected and maintained around saltwater tanks at any saltwater handling<br>
facility built or rebuilt on or after July 1, 2000. Dikes must be erected around saltwater<br>
tanks at any new facility within thirty days after the well has been completed. Dikes must<br>
be erected and maintained around saltwater tanks at saltwater handling facilities built<br>
prior to July 1, 2000, when deemed necessary by the director. Dikes as well as the base<br>
material under the dikes and within the diked area must be constructed of sufficiently<br>
impermeable material to provide emergency containment. Dikes must be of sufficient<br>
dimension to contain the total capacity of the largest tank plus one day's fluid production.<br>
The required capacity of the dike may be lowered by the director if the necessity therefor<br>
can be demonstrated to the director's satisfaction. Discharged saltwater liquids or brines<br>
must be properly removed and may not be allowed to remain standing within or outside<br>
of any diked areas.<br>
The operator shall take steps to minimize the amount of solids stored at the facility. Any salable<br>
crude oil recovered from a saltwater handling facility shall be reported on a form 5 SWD.<br>

Spill Response [40 CFR 112.7(a)(3)(iv)]<br>
The following steps would be taken to reduce the magnitude of the spill and to initiate<br>
containment and cleanup:<br>
1. </span><span class="ft1">Account for personnel, assure their safety, and evacuate if a fire, explosion, or exposure<br>
hazard exists.<br>
2. </span><span class="ft1">Remove all sources of ignition. Position fire suppression equipment. Alert the local Fire<br>
Department if necessary.<br>
3. </span><span class="ft1">Shut off pumps and close valves that allow oil to flow to the segment of the system<br>
causing the spill. Plug or patch leak/discharge if possible.<br>
4. </span><span class="ft1">Alert adjacent property owners/operators as warranted by the incident.<br>
5. </span><span class="ft1">As safety allows - attempt to contain the spill.<br>
Prevent or divert spilled oil from<br>
approaching structures or draining towards water or storm drains. Absorbent material,<br>
spark-proof shovels, brooms, neoprene gloves, and other spill response materials will be<br>
stored at the nearest field office.<br>
6. </span><span class="ft1">The Primary WOGC contact will conduct a safety assessment and determine additional<br>
cleanup actions as needed.<br>
Whiting maintains emergency spill trailers stocked with various types of booms, absorbents,<br>
safety equipment, personnel protection equipment, air monitoring equipment, instruments, and<br>
miscellaneous equipment at the Whiting Fairfield Office and the Whiting Robinson Lake Spill<br>
Trailer. Lists of available equipment maintained in these trailers are presented in Appendix C of<br>
this Plan and are on file at the Whiting Fairfield Office and the Whiting Robinson Lake Spill<br>
Trailer. In addition, Whiting is a member of a business co-op that maintains a Wibosco Leak<br>
Trailer and 14-foot Big John work boat that is stored at 116 9th Street SW, Watford City, ND. A<br>
list of materials available in the Wibosco Leak Trailer and contractors who have access to the<br>
trailer are included in Appendix C. Whiting personnel in Montana and North Dakota that are<br>
listed in this Plan and in the Whiting Emergency Response and Oil Spill Contingency Plan have<br>
access to this equipment.<br>
For all occurrences, the Primary WOGC contact will evaluate the incident and determine if<br>
notification is necessary. If a reportable spill occurs, the SPCC Plan will be amended to include<br>
a description of the spill, equipment changes, and/or operations changes required to prevent<br>
recurrence.<br>
3.5<br>
Disposal of Recovered Materials [40 CFR 112.7(a)(3)(v)]<br>
The disposal of waste oil and oily material recovered from spill cleanup operations will, in every<br>
case, be disposed of in a manner approved by the local, state, and federal agencies. Permits<br>
required for disposal vary on a case-by-case basis depending on type, volume, and condition of<br>
the material to be disposed. The designated person accountable for oil spill prevention at this<br>
facility is responsible for arranging the disposal of all recovered oil, contaminated absorbents,<br>

4.1<br>
Containment [40 CFR 112.7(a)(3)(iii); 40 CFR 112.7(c)]<br>
Oil-filled items, except qualified oil-filled operational equipment and flowlines and intra-facility<br>
gathering lines, must have appropriate containment and/or diversionary structures or equipment<br>
to prevent a discharge as described in 40 CFR Part 112.1(b). The entire containment system,<br>
including the walls and floor, must be capable of containing oil and must be constructed so that<br>
any discharge from a primary containment system, such as a tank, will not escape the<br>
containment system before cleanup occurs. As described in Section 6.0 of this Plan, storage<br>
tanks, equipment, and loading areas are provided with adequate spill containment.<br>
Spill containment methods include dikes, berms, or retaining walls sufficiently impervious to<br>
contain oil; curbing or drip pans; sumps and collection systems; culverting, gutters, or other<br>
drainage systems; weirs, booms, or other barriers; spill diversion ponds; retention ponds; or<br>
sorbent materials.<br>
In addition, shop-fabricated, double-walled aboveground storage tanks<br>
equipped with adequate technical spill and leak prevention options provide sufficient equivalent<br>
secondary containment as that required by 40 CFR Part 112.7(c).<br>
All double-walled tanks<br>
include overfill alarms, flow shutoff or restrictor devices, and constant monitoring of product<br>
transfers.<br>
4.2<br>
Demonstration of Impracticability [40 CFR 112.7(a)(2); 40 CFR 112.7(d)]<br>
If it is not practicable to install secondary containment as required, then additional<br>
prevention/response measures must be implemented.<br>
No required secondary containment<br>
systems at this facility were determined to be impracticable.<br>
Piping is present at this facility that is not located within containment. WOGC has developed an<br>
Oil Spill Contingency/Emergency Response Plan that is maintained at the nearest field office and<br>
with a WOGC Supervisor/Foreman.<br>
4.3<br>
Inspections, Tests, and Records [40 CFR 112.7(e)]<br>
All inspections and tests required by 40 CFR Part 112 are conducted in accordance with written<br>
procedures that WOGC developed. Daily visual observations are conducted by facility personnel<br>
who observe the condition of tanks, piping, valves, pumps, other oil storage equipment, ground<br>
surface, secondary containment, areas for drips, corrosion and fatigue which could indicate the<br>
potential for leaks. This is done on an on-going basis. All signs of leakage or potential leakage<br>
(i.e., visible staining) are reported to the Supervisor or his designee immediately. Items identified<br>
during the daily visual observations that require corrective action are reported to the Supervisor<br>
or his designee, who will ensure that corrective measures are implemented/completed.<br>
In addition to daily inspections, WOGC conducts comprehensive annual inspections at their<br>
facilities to ensure compliance with SPCC regulations, as well as other applicable local, state and<br>
federal regulations. Annual inspections are documented on Table 4 in Appendix A, and records<br>
are kept for a period of three years.<br>

Personnel, Training, and Discharge Prevention Measures [40 CFR 112.7(f)]<br>
All oil-handling personnel participate in a formal training session at least annually. Newly hired<br>
employees will be formally trained on spill prevention and response procedures before<br>
participating in any oil-related activities. Employee training will be documented on the form<br>
presented as Table 2 in Appendix A, and records will be maintained for a period of three years.<br>
At a minimum, oil-handling personnel will be trained in the operation and maintenance of<br>
equipment to prevent discharges; discharge procedure protocols; applicable pollution control<br>
laws, rules, and regulations; general facility operations; and, the contents of the facility SPCC<br>
Plan.<br>
4.5<br>
Brittle Fracture Evaluation [40 CFR 112.7(i)]<br>
There are no field-constructed tanks at these facilities.<br>
4.6<br>
Qualified Oil-filled Operational Equipment [40 CFR 112.7(k)]<br>
These facilities contain qualified oil-filled operational equipment (i.e., equipment that include an<br>
oil storage container in which the oil is present solely to support the function of the device and<br>
that have not had a single discharge exceeding 1,000 gallons or two discharges exceeding 42<br>
gallons within a twelve month period in the three years preceding this Plan). These items are not<br>
equipped with secondary containment.<br>
The qualified oil-filled operational equipment are included in the facility inspection program<br>
discussed in Section 4.3 of this Plan to detect equipment failure and/or discharges. An Oil Spill<br>
Contingency Plan/Emergency Response Plan following the provisions of 40 CFR Part 109 has<br>
been prepared by WOGC under separate cover, and Section 2.2 of this Plan contains a written<br>
commitment of manpower, equipment, and materials required to expeditiously control and<br>
remove any quantity of oil discharged that may be harmful.<br>

5.1<br>
Onshore Production Facility Requirements [40 CFR 112.9(a)]<br>
The general requirements listed in 40 CFR Part 112.7 are addressed as listed in the SPCC Cross<br>
Reference Summary in the preface of this Plan. The specific requirements listed in 40 CFR Part<br>
112.9 for production facilities are addressed below.<br>
5.2<br>
Facility Drainage [40 CFR 112.9(b)]<br>
The diked areas at the facilities may be equipped with manual drainage valves that are kept<br>
closed and sealed during normal operations to prevent unauthorized personnel from improperly<br>
discharging accumulated rainfall. No flapper-type drain valves or manually activated pumps are<br>
used to drain diked areas. Precipitation that accumulates within diked areas is visually inspected<br>
for sheen, and if none is present, the water is either allowed to evaporate or the drainage valve is<br>
opened by authorized personnel. The drainage valve releases the water to an oil/water separator<br>
if one is present at the facility. If sheen is evident, absorbent mats are used to trap the oil, and<br>
then the water is re-inspected.<br>
If no sheen is visible, the water is released.<br>
If there is a<br>
considerable amount of oil, the water is removed using a vacuum truck. Removed water is<br>
disposed of in accordance with applicable local, state, and federal regulations.<br>
Prior to the release of water from diked areas, the responsible personnel visually inspect the<br>
water in the containment structure and note the appearance of the water in the Secondary<br>
Containment Drainage Log included in Appendix A, Table 3 of this SPCC Plan. This log is also<br>
used to record the name of the employee draining the containment, as well as the date, time, and<br>
approximate quantity of water removed.<br>
Field drainage systems such as drainage ditches, oil traps, sumps, and skimmers are inspected as<br>
a part of the annual visual inspection. Any accumulations of oil are promptly removed.<br>
5.3<br>
Bulk Storage Tanks [40 CFR 112.7(a)(3)(ii); 40 CFR 112.7(e); 40 CFR 112.7(i); 40<br>
CFR 112.9(c)]<br>
(1)<br>
All tank materials and construction are compatible with the materials stored in the tanks,<br>
accounting for temperature and pressure.<br>
(2)<br>
All bulk storage tanks, separation, and treatment facilities, except flow-through process<br>
vessels, have a secondary means of containment for the entire capacity of the largest<br>
single container and sufficient freeboard to contain precipitation expected from a 25 year,<br>
24 hour rainfall event and the average daily fluid production (flow ­through rate). All<br>
diked areas are sufficiently impervious to contain discharged oil for the length of time<br>
required to clean up spilled material.<br>
The undiked areas of the facility with the potential for a discharge include sections of<br>
aboveground piping, oil-filled operational equipment, and tank-side loading/unloading<br>
areas.<br>
In the event of a discharge, the pumper will use spill cleanup materials and<br>
equipment to contain the discharge. Additional spill cleanup materials and equipment are<br>

WOGC has a daily and annual inspection procedure for all sites. Daily observations are<br>
conducted by facility personnel who observe the condition of the tanks, piping, valves,<br>
pumps, other oil storage equipment, ground surface and secondary containment areas for<br>
drips, corrosion and fatigue which could indicate the potential for leaks. The annual<br>
inspection procedures are presented in Appendix A, Table 4. In addition to the<br>
observations noted above, personnel visually inspect the outside of all tanks for signs of<br>
deterioration and maintenance needs. All tanks, tank supports, and foundations undergo<br>
a visual inspection for integrity. The annual inspections are documented on Table 4 in<br>
Appendix A, and records are kept for a period of three years. If a field-constructed,<br>
aboveground container undergoes a repair, an alteration, a reconstruction, or a change in<br>
service that might materially affect the risk of a discharge or failure due to brittle fracture<br>
or other catastrophe, or has discharged oil or failed due to brittle fracture failure or other<br>
catastrophe, the container is evaluated for risk of discharge or failure due to brittle<br>
fracture or other catastrophe, and as necessary, appropriate action is taken.<br>
(4)<br>
Overfill protection methods are described in detail in Section 6.0 of this Plan. In general,<br>
all tanks have adequate capacity to assure that they will not overfill if a pumper is<br>
delayed in making regularly scheduled rounds, and most tanks have overflow equalizing<br>
lines between containers so that a full tank can overflow to an adjacent tank. In addition,<br>
some tanks are equipped with a head switch or pump cutoff device. Liquid level sensing<br>
devices are tested during the annual inspection to ensure proper operation.<br>

Facility Transfer Operations [40 CFR 112.7(a)(3)(ii); 40 CFR 112.9(d)]<br>
(1)<br>
All aboveground pipes, valves, and appurtenances are inspected as a part of the daily and<br>
annual visual inspection. The inspection includes an assessment of the general condition<br>
of flange joints, valve glands and bodies, drip pans, pipeline supports, pumping well<br>
polish rod stuffing boxes, bleeder and gauge valves, and other such items. These annual<br>
visual inspections are documented on the form in Appendix A, Table 4, and records are<br>
kept for a period of three years.<br>

All flowlines and intra-facility gathering lines and associated valves and equipment are<br>
compatible with the type of production fluids, their potential corrosivity, volume, and<br>
pressure, and other conditions expected in the operational environment.<br>
The<br>
aboveground flowlines, intra-faciltiy gathering lines, and associated appurtenances are<br>
inspected for leaks, oil discharges, corrosion, or other conditions that could lead to a<br>
discharge on a regular schedule as part of the external visual inspection. Corrective<br>
actions or repairs identified during the inspection will be taken, and any accumulations of<br>
oil will be promptly removed or stabilization and remediation actions will be initiated.<br>
The flow line maintenance program is specifically implemented to maintain the integrity<br>
of the flow lines to minimize releases of oil from this portion of the production facility.<br>
The facility's flow lines are configured, are inspected daily and annually for leaks and for<br>
corrosion (pitting, flaking) at connections and at each joint, and are maintained to<br>
minimize the potential for a discharge as summarized below. Flow lines are inspected<br>
daily. Additionally, flow lines are inspected according to the annual inspection program<br>
presented in Appendix A, Table 4.<br>
· Configuration: Flow lines are identified on facility maps to facilitate access and<br>
inspection by facility personnel. With the exception of underground flow line<br>
sections, the flow lines and appurtenances (valves, flange joints, and supports) can<br>
be visually observed for signs of leakage, deterioration, or other damage.<br>
· Inspection: Lines are visually inspected for leaks and corrosion as part of the<br>
annual tank and berm inspection by field personnel. The buried portions of the<br>
flow lines are visually observed for damage or coating condition whenever they<br>
are repaired, replaced, or otherwise exposed.<br>
Copies of inspections are<br>
maintained at the facility.<br>
· Maintenance: Any leak in the flow line or appurtenances is promptly addressed<br>
by isolating the damaged portion and repairing or replacing the faulty piece of<br>
equipment.<br>

Kuykendall 34-31-1H is a crude oil production facility that consists of three wells, twelve crude<br>
oil storage tanks, eight produced water storage tanks, three heater/treaters, two recycle pumps<br>
and associated piping/flow lines. The following three wellheads are associated with the<br>
Kuykendall 34-31-1H tank battery: Kuykendall 34-31-1H, Voll 14-32-1H and Voll 14-32-2H. In<br>
this section, the bulk storage tanks and equipment are summarized in Table 6.1.1; any identified<br>
deficiencies are presented in Table 6.1.2. A Site Location Map is provided in Figure 6.1.1, and a<br>
Site Plot Plan is provided in Figure 6.1.2.<br>
6.1.2<br>
Operation [40 CFR 112.7(a)(3)]<br>
The facility operates twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week. This facility is attended<br>
by an onsite Supervisor and/or Foreman, or their designee, described in Section 2.1 of this Plan,<br>
who checks the facility daily and performs all routine maintenance.<br>
6.1.3<br>
Products Handled [40 CFR 112.7(a)(3)(i); 40 CFR 112.7(b)]<br>
This facility handles crude oil and produced water. Worst case spill scenarios, a tank inventory,<br>
and a containment summary can be found in Table 6.1.1.<br>
6.1.4<br>
Bulk Storage Tanks [40 CFR 112.7(a)(3)(i)]<br>
This facility has twenty above ground storage tanks located within a single berm. The tanks<br>
store crude oil and produced water. The tanks are gauged by hand and are connected by an<br>
overflow equalizing line.<br>
6.1.5<br>
Oil-filled Operational Equipment [40 CFR 112.7(k)]<br>
The facility contains three pump jack pumping units associated with the three wells (Kuykendall<br>
34-31-1H, Voll 14-32-1H and Voll 14-32-2H), located in the center of the site. The facility also<br>
contains two recycle pumps.<br>
6.1.6<br>
Flow-through Process Vessels [40 CFR 112.9(c)(5)]<br>
The facility contains three 100-barrel vertical heater/treaters located in the eastern portion of the<br>
site.<br>
6.1.7<br>
Loading Operations [40 CFR 112.9(d)]<br>
Crude oil and produced water are removed from the site via contracted tank trucks. The truck<br>
driver supervises all loading operations. The trucks park next to the tank battery area, and the<br>
loading operations follow a standard procedure.<br>
A copy of this procedure can be found in<br>

Piping Systems [40 CFR 112.7(a)(3)]<br>
Above ground piping is restricted to areas directly around the wellheads, heater/treaters, and<br>
twenty storage tanks. All other piping is underground. Figure 6.1.2 shows the location of all<br>
connecting lines at the site.<br>
For piping that is located outside of containment, WOGC has<br>
prepared an Oil Contingency/Emergence Response Plan. This Plan is maintained at the nearest<br>
field office and with the site Supervisor/Foreman.<br>

Spill Containment [40 CFR 112.7(a)(3)(iii)]<br>
Spill containment is provided for the twenty storage tanks. The twenty storage tanks are located<br>
within a single, lined, earthen berm that is sized to hold the volume of the largest tank plus<br>
sufficient freeboard to contain a 25 year, 24 hour rainfall event and the average daily fluid<br>
production (flow-through rate). The bermed areas are not equipped with drainage valves. Spill<br>
containment is summarized in Table 6.1.1.<br>
Spill containment is also provided for the heater/treaters. The heater/treaters are located within a<br>
single, lined, earthen berm that is sized to hold the volume of the largest tank plus sufficient<br>
freeboard to contain a 25 year, 24 hour rainfall event. The bermed areas are not equipped with<br>

From Containment Structure in North Dakota<br>
Facility Name:<br>
Discharge Location:<br>
Procedure for draining water from containment after a rain event:<br>
1. Drain lines must have a manual valve and a lock. Drains must be locked in the closed<br>
position when not in use.<br>
2. Prior to draining the containment, the water must be inspected for the absence of a sheen.<br>
Should a sheen be present, use a vacuum truck and haul off for proper disposal.<br>
3. The draining event must be recorded on the log sheet below and signed by the inspector or<br>
supervisor.<br>
4. When discharge is complete the drain must be closed and locked. Keep this record for three<br>
years in the site Environmental File 2.1.<br>

PROCEDURES<br>
Truck Loading/Unloading Procedures<br>
LOADING/UNLOADING OF FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS<br>
AND COMPRESSED GASES FOR TANK CARS AND TRUCKS<br>
All tank cars and tank trucks must be loaded in accordance with the safety procedures delineated<br>
below and with any additional applicable federal, state, or local regulations.<br>
1. A qualified loader shall be present throughout the loading/unloading process.<br>
2. The loader must be aware of what procedures are to be followed if an emergency occurs<br>
while loading/unloading.<br>
3. The loader is authorized to stop the loading/unloading process whenever he feels the<br>
conditions warrant discontinuation.<br>
4. The tank car(s) or truck tanker(s) must be compatible for the product being loaded. The tank<br>
truck must also have valid and proper permit numbers and letters affixed to its tank. The<br>
tank car or truck shall be placarded for the material being loaded.<br>
5. The truck's hand brake must be engaged in addition to chocking the rear wheels of truck<br>
before loading.<br>
6. Prior to filling and departure, closely inspect the lowermost drain and all outlets for<br>
discharges, and if necessary, ensure that they are tightened, adjusted, or replaced to prevent a<br>
discharge of liquid during transit.<br>
7. Prior to connecting the fill line, the tank car or truck shall be bonded from the fill line to the<br>
tank, and the tank car or truck shall be grounded/bonded. Metal to metal contact for these<br>
connections must be made. After loading is complete, the cable should remain connected for<br>
a few minutes to dissipate accumulation of static charges before disconnecting.<br>
8. At facilities having separate pumps, the truck's engine, lights, radio, etc. must be turned off<br>
before loading begins. The driver and passengers must remain out of the cab at all times<br>
during the loading/unloading process.<br>
9. The maximum fill level of the tank shall never be exceeded, and thermal expansion<br>
characteristics of the liquids shall be considered.<br>
41<br>
<hr>
<A name=93></a>10. Loading must be halted during electrical storms.<br>
11. The tank cars and tank trucks must be empty when beginning to load to prevent possible<br>
contamination of our product with a lower quality product and to prevent overloading.<br>
12. Smoking shall not be permitted within 150 feet of the loading area<br>
13. If a spill occurs during loading, do not start the truck or allow other possible sources of<br>
ignition within 150 feet until the area is gas tested and determined to be safe.<br>
14. Loading hoses with quick connect fittings shall have levers secured prior to pumping.<br>

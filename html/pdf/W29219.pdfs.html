2. Well Summary<br>
The CCU Golden Creek 44-23TFH is an extended reach single lateral production well in the Upper Three<br>
Forks Formation in Dunn County, North Dakota. The lateral well was drilled south to north, crossing from<br>
the SHL at 455' FSL &amp; 253' FEL of section 23, T147N, R95W into section 14, T147N, R95W, and<br>
followed an approximate azimuth of 357.62 degrees until reaching total depth BHL at 51' FNL &amp; 663'<br>
FEL of section 14, T147N, R95W. The drilling target pay zone was approximately a 24 feet thick zone<br>
(~28-52' below the Lower Bakken Shale). The overall dip rate of this lateral was approximately 0.43' per<br>
100' or 89.76 degree down dip.<br>
The well has a total lateral length of 9,563' with the following in-zone statistics:<br>

3. Vertical &amp; Build Curve Well Section<br>
The vertical was drilled with a tangent of 3 degrees, with the build started at 2,589' MD to 5200'<br>
MD. The vertical hole was drilled with no build to a KOP of 10,752' MD; from this depth the curve<br>

build section was initiated. The build section was initiated with a planned curve of 14.0 degrees per<br>
hundred feet, for a total of 634 feet. The tops came in slightly higher than the well prognosis (see<br>
chart below) and the landing remained to 11168' TVD. Landing was made at 11,386' MD,<br>
11,166.09' TVD, and 7" casing was set at 11376' MD, (11165.6 TVD, -8737' SSTVD), at Coord:<br>
342.66' N, -273.8' E, Legal: 798' FSL, 527' FEL, S23 T147N-R95W. The curve was completed in 34<br>
drilling hours.<br>

4. Gas and Oil Shows<br>
4.1. Uphole and Build Shows Table:<br>
The first noteworthy gas show appeared while drilling the vertical portion of the well when we<br>
were in the Lodgepole formation at 11051' MD. It showed up as a 520 unit formation gas. The next gas<br>
shows occurred in the curve portion of the well when we drilled through the Upper Bakken Shale at<br>
approximately 11079' MD, and Lower Bakken Shale, 11166' MD, showing up as a 1252 unit formation<br>
gas. After this peak, gas leveled out and we were recording background gas of 400-1000 units until we<br>
TD'd the curve at 11,386' MD.<br>

5. Lithology<br>
Samples: See mud log and horizontal logs for full sample descriptions. All samples were taken at<br>
30' lagged intervals from the shakers, cleaned, labeled, and bagged for shipment to the state of North<br>
Dakota. The samples collected with the best quality were within the first 2000' of the lateral just outside<br>
the casing shoe. After this, samples were returned ground up into fine sand and were extremely fine<br>
grained at the tail end of the lateral.<br>

Well File # 29219<br>
Dear DONNA :<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 18849, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft5">200' setback </span><span class="ft4">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft5">500' setback </span><span class="ft4">from the east &amp; west boundaries within<br>
the CORRAL CREEK-BAKKEN UNIT.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must<br>
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are<br>
conducted. BURLINGTON RES O&amp;G CO must contact NDIC Field Inspector Ashleigh Devenberg at<br>
701-290-3277 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum<br>
legal coordinate from the well head is: 9906N.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,<br>
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.<br>
and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours<br>
or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey<br>
contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.<br>
Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director<br>
may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is<br>
hereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing<br>
on the date the well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well<br>
records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall<br>
permit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or<br>
controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to<br>
have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect<br>
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time<br>
upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and<br>
shall be available only to the Commission and its staff.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft3">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>
Assistant Director<br>

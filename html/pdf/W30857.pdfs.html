DETAILS OF WORK<br>
EOG Resources, Inc. requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-55. EOG Resources, Inc. intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set<br>
surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth<br>
pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the<br>
drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical<br>
seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of<br>
drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing<br>
plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance<br>
with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings<br>
and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not<br>
intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with<br>
acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. EOG Resources, Inc. understands<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced<br>
immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 &amp; 19.1). EOG Resources, Inc.<br>
will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days<br>
after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.<br>

HORIZONTAL WELL<br>
WAYZETTA 66-2536H<br>
NWSW Section 25-153N-90W<br>
Mountrail County<br>
Well File # 30857<br>
Dear Jennifer:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 25771, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is granted on<br>
the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than 500' to the boundary of the spacing unit the lateral<br>
is most nearly parallel to and 200' to the boundary of the spacing unit the lateral is most nearly perpendicular to within the 1280 acre<br>
spacing unit consisting of Sections 25 &amp; 36 T153N R90W. Based on the proposed directional plan the setbacks are: 200' from the north &amp;<br>
south, and 500' from the east &amp; west boundary. </span><span class="ft2">Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be<br>
maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-<br>
back whenever filtration operations are conducted.<br>
Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding<br>
the entire location. EOG RESOURCES, INC. must take into consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when<br>
contemplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned location. Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation)<br>
"No boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank."<br>
EOG RESOURCES INC must contact NDIC Field Inspector Robert Garbe at 701-720-3262 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion<br>
operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and<br>
freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized<br>
representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director<br>
prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The proposed directional<br>
plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is: 59'E. Also, based on the azimuth of the<br>
proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 6879'S.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit<br>
on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following<br>
publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn<br>
affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and<br>
any other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit,<br>
the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given immediately upon the<br>
spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information<br>
must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.<br>
Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a certified<br>
copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or<br>
in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the<br>
survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one<br>
adobe document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90<br>
feet in the lateral.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is hereby granted. Such<br>
information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing on the date the well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well records wherever located.<br>
Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall permit the Director and his representatives to come<br>
upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and<br>
operation of such wells and to have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect<br>
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time upon request. The<br>
information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and shall be available only to the Commission and<br>
its staff.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement<br>
utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones<br>
can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the<br>
presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production<br>
or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as<br>
one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a<br>
standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov </span><span class="ft0">Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>
Assistant Director<br>

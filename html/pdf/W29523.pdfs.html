Well File # 29523<br>
Dear Meghan:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24947, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, </span><span class="ft3">shall be located<br>
approximately down the east-west axis </span><span class="ft1">(500' drilling corridor per Commission policy) and be no closer than the<br>
200' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 1, 2, 11 &amp;<br>
12, T150N R95W. </span><span class="ft4">*Sections 1, 2, and 12 are within the Spotted Horn Field.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter<br>
sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site<br>
during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. APPROVAL OF<br>
THE REMOTE PRODUCTION FACILITY IS DEPENDENT UPON FURTHER NDIC REVIEW. QEP<br>
ENERGY CO must contact NDIC Field Inspector Joyce Kohut at 701-202-1288 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing<br>
point is: 693 S. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well<br>
head is: 9727 E.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft3">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

NOTES ON 9-5/8" SURFACE CASING DESIGN:<br>
The key point in designing surface casing is to extend the shoe of the surface casing beyond the top of<br>
the Pierre Shale. This ensures that all potable or usable water zones are covered. At this point in the well<br>
design, the drilling fluid is changed to oil base mud to contend with salt sections that occur at<br>
approximately 6,700' TVD and 9,100' TVD. The 36 ppf J55 casing accomplishes these criteria easily.<br>
A higher burst rating is not necessary based on industry standards throughout the Williston Basin.<br>
In the event the surface casing burst rating was increased, the normally pressured and sub normally<br>
pressured zones all the way thru the Madison Group at approximately 8,350' TVD has the potential to<br>
break down. Therefore the increased pressure rating of surface casing is not warranted. It is not feasible<br>
to set the surface casing point at a greater depth because the shut in surface pressures would not<br>
appreciably increase. The Dakota formation (5,000' TVD) is frequently weak. Typically, we drill the<br>
intermediate section with 10.5 ppg OBM to the 7" casing point. In the event we lost circulation in the<br>
exposed intermediate interval, the wellbore will not be entirely evacuated and the surface casing can be<br>
shut in without compromising the pressure rating of the 36 ppf J-55.<br>
Calculations for the Surface Casing Design:<br>
3,520 psi/ (5,904 psi (Reservoir Pressure) ­ (10,814 ft x 0.22 psi/ft)) = safety factor of 1.0<br>

Additional Information For Oil Base Mud<br>
A. Oil-base mud will be mixed in the closed circulating system and transferred to 500-bbl tanks on<br>
location for storage prior to and after drilling operations. Drip pans will be installed below the<br>
rotary beams on the substructure and can be viewed on site from the cellar area. As the intermediate<br>
and production section of the hole is drilled, the cuttings transported to the surface with the drilling<br>
fluid will be mechanically separated from the drilling fluid as waste by shale-shakers and then<br>
cleaned/dried via a mud cleaner and/or centrifuge. These separated cuttings will be transferred to a<br>
container, dried and stabilized, and then transported to an approved disposal site or, if a cuttings pit<br>
is approved, the solidified and dried cuttings will be stored in the pit.<br>
B. Plastic material will underlay the rig, oil base mud/diesel storage tanks and mud pits. All tanks on<br>
location will be placed inside of berms. Any oily waste fluids and sediments generated at the work<br>
site during drilling operations or when cleaning the fluid containment system after drilling will also<br>
be stabilized and then transported to an approved disposal site or, if a cuttings pit is approved, it will<br>
be solidified and stored in the cuttings pit.<br>

C. All rig ditches will be lined and directed to a lined sump for fluid recovery. A drip pan will be<br>
installed on the BOP stack, a mud bucket will be utilized as needed on connections and a vacuum<br>
system will be used on the rig floor for fluid recovery in those areas.<br>

D. If a cuttings pit is deemed necessary and acceptable due to unforeseen circumstances and/or<br>
complications with the disposal method described in 10.A above, drill solids and excess cement will<br>
be placed in the cuttings pit and the oilfield waste management consultant Soli-Bond (or a similar<br>
company) will mobilize equipment and personnel to the site to perform the cement based<br>
solidification/stabilization process in-situ for encapsulation with cement kiln dust or flyash prior to<br>
placement in the cuttings pit. Once the drilling operation is complete, the lined cuttings pit will be<br>
reclaimed to grade elevation.<br>

1.  Affidavit:  attached as a part of this gas capture plan.  <br>
2.  Detailed gas gathering pipeline system location map <br>
Oneok Rockies Midstream ("OKRM") <br>
 <br>
Name and Location of gas processing plant:  </span><span class="ft3">Garden Creek, Sect 35T151NR98W</span><span class="ft2"> <br>
Name of gas gatherer and location of lines for each gas gatherer in the vicinity:  </span><span class="ft3">OKRM 16" poly <br>
highlighted in red, pending ROW acquisition and construction <br>
Proposed Route and Tiein point for well connection: </span><span class="ft3">See above gathering system map</span><span class="ft2"> <br>
3.  Detailed information for Blue Buttes/Grail/Sandstone compression capacity (circled in blue): <br>
Maximum current daily capacity:  </span><span class="ft3">Total: 95 MMcfd (Sandstone: 60; Blue Buttes: 35; Grail: 0) Note:  Grail <br>
station expected to startup in midSeptember 2014 <br>

Grail: 35) <br>
Gas gatherer issues or expansion plans for the area:  </span><span class="ft1">Beginning September, 2014, OKRM has adequate <br>
pipeline, processing plant and compression capacity for QEP's current and forecasted gas through mid<br>
2015.  These midstream facilities were designed to handle approximately 70 MMcfd of QEP's gas.  <br>
Should future iterations of QEP's volume forecast exceed 70 MMcfd, QEP will require another OKRM <br>
expansion for compression and pipelines and has alerted OKRM of this possibility.</span><span class="ft2">  <br>

5.  QEP flaring amounts: <br>
Statewide percentage of gas flared for existing wells in the Bakken petroleum system: </span><span class="ft1">53% for the most <br>
recent month of July 2014 (28.0 MMcfd flared /52.5 MMcfd produced) <br>
Field wide percentage of gas flared for this well: </span><span class="ft1">0% in the Spotted Horn field for the most recent month <br>
of July 2014 (0.0 MMcfd flared/0.7 MMcfd produced); 3% in the Blue Buttes field for the most recent <br>
month of July 2014 (0.03 MMcfd flared/0.95 MMcfd produced) <br>
6.  QEP Alternatives to flaring: <br>
Specific alternative systems available for consideration: </span><span class="ft1">When OKRM is at capacity or not connected, <br>
QEP has considered and implemented JT conditioning skids for its flaring wells.  QEP has done this on 3 <br>
pads in Sections 33, 34 &amp; 35 of T149NR95W (vendor MontanaDakota).  QEP also is looking at site usage <br>
for a number of applications to include powering wellhead equipment, drilling rigs, gas lift, etc.  Further, <br>
<hr>
<A name=32></a>QEP is installing gaspowered generators on our pads in the Mandaree field (FBIR) instead of using diesel <br>
fuel (second half of 2014).   <br>
Details of flaring reductions if such alternative plans are implemented:</span><span class="ft2"> </span><span class="ft0">No significant flaring reductions <br>
have been achieved from our implemented or planned alternative systems thus far.  However, the <br>
MontanaDakota JT skids do reduce our VOCs by 85% where they are installed.  <br>

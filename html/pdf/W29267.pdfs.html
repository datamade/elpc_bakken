HORIZONTAL WELL<br>
HARRIER 5401 44-23 5B<br>
LOT1 Section 23-154N-101W<br>
Williams County<br>
Well File # 29267<br>
Dear Brandi:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 21978, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft4">200' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft4">1220' setback </span><span class="ft2">(per Commission policy) from the east &amp;<br>
west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 26 &amp; 35 T154N R101W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: In order to justify the spacing unit, the HARRIER 5401-44-23 5B must be<br>
the first well drilled, or the wells may be drilled back-to-back. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-<br>
proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning<br>
when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever<br>
filtration operations are conducted.<br>
DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS WELL IS LOCATED<br>
WITHIN A MUNICIPALITY AND ON AQUIFER AN ONSITE INSPECTION IS REQUIRED.<br>
CONTACT NDIC FIELD INSPECTOR FOR SITE SPECIFIC STIPULATIONS TO INCLUDE BUT<br>
NOT LIMITED TO: CLOSED MUD SYSTEM, NO DRILLING PIT, AN IMPERMEABLE<br>
SYNTHETIC LINER IS REQUIRED ON THE ENTIRE LOCATION, LOCATION FENCED, A 3'<br>
PERIMETER DIKE AROUND ENTIRE LOCATION, A STRING OF CASING MUST BE PLACED<br>
IN THE RAT AND MOUSE HOLE AND CEMENTED TO GROUND LEVEL. OASIS PETRO NO<br>
AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector John Axtman at 701-770-2564 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinates from the well head at casing<br>
point are: 838' south and 576' west.<br>
Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal<br>
coordinate from the well head is: 10995' south.<br>

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft1">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft4">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>

Purpose of the Plan<br>
The purpose of the emergency plan is to prepare Oasis Operations and Regulatory<br>
Agencies in the event that an emergency will occur that would cause an interruption in<br>
operations or a potential release of hydrocarbons from the location due to an unforeseen<br>
emergency. Flooding is a unique type of potential emergency, although the contact<br>
information and general response procedure will not vary from this plan.<br>
The National Weather Service in Bismarck will issue warnings due to spring snow melt<br>
ice jams, flash floods, and main river flooding; they normally will indicate which areas<br>
have the flood warnings and the expected rise in height of water. The National Weather<br>
Service will normally issue first a Flood Watch next a Flood Warning.<br>
A Flood Watch is issued when the risk of a hazardous hydrologic event has increased<br>
significantly, but its occurrence, location, and/or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to<br>
Page 3 of 7<br>
<hr>
<A name=59></a>provide enough lead time so those who need to set their plans in motion can do so.<br>
Watches evolve into warnings, advisories, or they are canceled.<br>
A Flood Warning is issued when the risk of a hazardous hydrologic event is occurring,<br>
is imminent, or has a very high probability of occurrence. A warning is used for<br>
conditions posing a threat to life or property. The NWS is the single "official" voice<br>
when issuing warnings for life-threatening situations.<br>
A Flood Advisory is for less serious conditions that cause significant inconvenience and,<br>
if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property.<br>

<A href="http://www.nd.gov/des/info/flood.html">http://www.nd.gov/des/info/flood.html </a>. This website also has a listing of local county<br>
emergency managers (click on "Local Resources") on the same site; for the area of<br>
concern which is both McKenzie and Williams County.<br>
This plan provides for Operational response should an emergency jeopardize the well site<br>
location. To be effective, the plan requires the cooperation and effort of each person and<br>
agency participating in the operation of the well. Each person must know his/her<br>
responsibilities and duties should the location face an emergency scenario. Each person<br>
and agency should familiarize themselves with the plan and make any suggestions that<br>
will improve the plan.<br>
It is the intention of Oasis Petroleum to make every effort to provide adequate safeguards<br>
against harm to persons or the environment in the event of an emergency or flood that<br>
may jeopardize this location. However, the initiative rests with the suggestions of the<br>
individuals involved in the operations of the well, who are welcomed to act as a<br>
fundamental tool for providing the safest working conditions possible in the event of an<br>
emergency by following the plan and providing adequate communication to those<br>
involved should the plan need modification. During potential flooding season the well<br>
site should be prepared to implement the plan under short notice.<br>
Operating Procedures<br>
The intent is to produce the well in a way that will not damage the reservoir nor result in<br>
the uncontrolled release of hydrocarbon on the surface. Any spills of hydrocarbons<br>
should be reported to the Production Superintendent and the appropriate governmental<br>
agencies. Operations clean up procedures should be implemented to minimize the impact<br>
to the environment and approved by the appropriate governmental agency.<br>
The complex job of producing oil and gas is a 24 hour around the clock job. Even with<br>
much of the work performed during daylight, oil and gas are being produced at all hours<br>
of the day and night. It is the job of the production operations people to keep the well<br>
Page 4 of 7<br>
<hr>
<A name=60></a>safely producing and minimize any impact to the environment. The people involved in<br>
these operations will be the Lease Operator, Roustabouts, Production Foreman,<br>
Production Superintendent, Production Manager, Operations Management, Transport<br>
Companies, and Governmental Agencies.<br>

Emergency Procedures<br>
Drilling Operations:<br>
Drilling operations will be conducted during the winter period when flood or ice jams<br>
severity potential is at a minimum. The drilling location should maintain a 24 inch berm<br>
around the location to contain fluids on location. The drilling will be completed using a<br>
closed loop mud system with no open earth pits. Once drilling and completion operations<br>
are finished the pad size should be shrunk and the disturbed area reclaimed. The<br>
Production pad should have a minimum of two foot diversion berm placed around the<br>
production location. The production facilities will be located on the neighboring Kestrel<br>
pad.<br>
Should the threat of potential flooding occur during drilling operations, then all fuel,<br>
lubricants, chemicals, mud, vehicles, and excess equipment should be moved out of the<br>
flood zone and temporarily stored on the nearest available location at an elevation outside<br>
of the potential flood level. A packer should be set in the deepest casing string and the<br>
drill pipe set on the slips and excess joints laid down. The operations should be shut<br>
down until the Flood Warning or Watch is canceled.<br>
Production Operations:<br>
Flood Watch: Issued for the Missouri River, Williams County North Dakota<br>
Page 5 of 7<br>
<hr>
<A name=61></a>Production Superintendent (Conrad Ellis) will confer with the NDIC (John Axtman),<br>
Production Manager (Andy Davison), and Operations General Manager (Eric Bayes) to<br>
determine the path forward and potential severity of the flood.<br>
The Production Superintendent will coordinate with transport trucks and the Lease<br>
Operator to reduce any excess chemicals from the location. The diversion berm (2')<br>
around the location should be repaired as necessary. The containment berms around the<br>
production equipment at the Kestrel location should be repaired. The location, wellhead,<br>
and production equipment should be cleaned if necessary of excess lubricants or oil. The<br>
access road will be monitored and additional construction equipment will be placed on<br>
standby to ensure continued access to the location. Should access be jeopardize the<br>
Production Superintendent will move to the next level of Emergency Response. The<br>
Production Superintendent will continue to monitor the Flood Warnings until they are<br>
canceled. Impacted Government Agencies should communicate any additional<br>
information or concerns to the Production Superintendent.<br>
Flood Warning: Issued for the Missouri River, Williams County North Dakota<br>
Production Superintendent (Conrad Ellis) will confer with the NDIC (John Axtman),<br>
Production Manager (Andy Davison), and Operations General Manager (Eric Bayes) to<br>
determine the path forward and potential severity of the flood. Impacted Government<br>
Agencies should communicate any additional information or concerns to the Production<br>
Superintendent.<br>
The Production Superintendent will coordinate with the Lease Operator to ensure the<br>
following:<br>
1. Shut the producing well in.<br>
2. Flush all flow lines of excess production fluids with fresh water.<br>
3. Place a minimum of 6 feet of produced water in all tanks and heater treaters.<br>
4. Remove all chemicals and lubricants from the location. Drain and flush all<br>
transfer lines with fresh water. Wells located in potential high flow flood water<br>
areas should have tank to ground tie downs installed.<br>
5. Isolate and shut in all valves.<br>
6. Tighten the pack off on the stuffing box to prevent communication; remove any<br>
self lubricator on the polished rod. Set the brake on the pumping unit. Steam<br>
clean wellhead and pumping unit as required, vacuum up cleaning fluids.<br>
7. Isolate all power to the location.<br>
8. Remove electrical motors or transfer pumps that may be submerged.<br>
9. The access road will be monitored and additional construction equipment will be<br>
placed on standby to ensure continued access to the location as appropriate. The<br>
diversion berm (2') should be in good repair.<br>
10.The Production Superintendent will continue to monitor the Flood Watch or<br>
Flood Warnings until they are canceled.<br>
Page 6 of 7<br>
<hr>
<A name=62></a>11.The Production Superintendent will continue to communicate with impacted<br>
Governmental Agencies and modify the implementation of the plan as required.<br>
Procedure to Return well to Production post Flooding Event:<br>
Production Superintendent (Conrad Ellis) will confer with the NDIC (John Axtman),<br>
Production Manager (Andy Davison), and Operations General Manager (Eric Bayes) to<br>
make an initial inspection of the location. Impacted Government Agencies should<br>
communicate any additional information or concerns to the Production Superintendent.<br>
Based on this site inspection, a plan will be developed to safely return the well to<br>
production. An approved plan by the NDIC will be implemented and should consider the<br>
following:<br>
1. The Production Superintendent will continue to communicate with impacted<br>
Governmental Agencies and modify the implementation of the plan as required<br>
and modify the plan with any concerns or issues raised by the impacted parties.<br>
2. The access road should be inspected to ensure it stable enough to handle truck and<br>
equipment loads. Repairs should be completed as necessary.<br>
3. The production site should be cleared of excess water within the containment<br>
berm. The water should be tested to see if it can be used in Oasis Operations, or if<br>
safe diverted outside of the berm (this will require a permit from the<br>
NDIC).Otherwise dispose of the water in the proper facilities. After the excess<br>
water has been removed, the site should be allowed to dry. If the 2' containment<br>
berm has been damaged this should be repaired.<br>
4. Any water trapped within the production containment berm should be tested for<br>
use in operations or hauled to disposal as the volumes dictate. The site should be<br>
allowed to dry.<br>
5. Any excess soil or sediments deposited by the flooding event should be removed<br>
or added to the containment berm, the location should be leveled and have<br>
additional gravel base applied to allow safe operations. Correct drainage<br>
diversion, culverts, cattle guards should be cleaned or repaired as necessary.<br>
6. The production equipment should be evaluated to ensure that it is still stable and<br>
has not moved due to the flooding event. All footings and cement slabs should be<br>
inspect and ensure that they are still level.<br>
7. Electrical motors and transfer pumps should be reinstalled. A certified electrician<br>
should inspect wiring and repair damaged panels. The site should then have<br>
electricity restored.<br>
8. The pumping unit should be inspected for flood damage; repairs should be made<br>
to level the unit. Lubricants should be restored.<br>
9. All lines and valves should be inspected and retested as required. The Lease<br>
Operator, Field Foreman, and Production Superintendent should re-commission<br>
the well for production.<br>
10.Seek final approval from the NDIC that the well has tested and ready for<br>
production. Return well to Production.<br>

<A name=68></a>GENERAL<br>
DESCRIPTION OF HYDROGEN SULFIDE GAS<br>
H2S is a colorless gas, which smells similar to rotten eggs in low concentrations.<br>
In large concentrations or over long periods of exposure, the sense of smell may be<br>
paralyzed. H2S is an extremely toxic gas that must be treated with extreme care to<br>
prevent injury to people. H2S is heavier than air (specific gravity =1.19) and on still<br>
days tends to accumulate in low places. This accumulation could build up and lead to<br>
dangerous concentrations. However, if the H2S gas is warmer than air, it will tend to<br>
rise until cooled off and could affect workers above the escaping source.<br>
TOXICITY<br>
Hydrogen sulfide is extremely toxic (poisonous). It is almost as toxic as<br>
hydrogen cyanide. It produces irritation to the eyes, throat and respiratory tract. The<br>
sense of smell can be lost in 2-15 minutes in low concentrations due to paralysis to the<br>
olfactory nerves. The sense of smell can be lost in 60 seconds or less in higher<br>
concentrations. Susceptibility to H2S poisoning varies to the number of exposures.<br>
The second exposure being more dangerous than the first.<br>
The results of inhalation of H2S may be strangulation in a few seconds of<br>
exposure to high H2S concentrations. This produces symptoms such as panting, pallor,<br>
cramps, paralysis of the pupil, and loss of speech. This is generally followed by<br>
immediate loss of consciousness. Death may occur quickly from respiratory and<br>
cardiac paralysis. One quick sniff of high concentration can cause death. Coughing,<br>
eye burning and pain, throat irritation, and sleepiness come from exposure to low<br>
concentrations.<br>
The two following charts list some of the toxic characteristics of H2S. (See<br>
following page).<br>

<A name=72></a>HYDROGEN SULFIDE CONTINGENCY PLAN<br>
OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA, LLC<br>
This plan provides for personal safety programs, precautionary measures, safety<br>
equipment and emergency procedures, and sets forth responsibilities and duties<br>
pertaining to drilling in a sour gas area.<br>
To be effective, the plan requires the cooperation and effort of each person<br>
participating in the drilling of an H2S well. Each person must know his/hers<br>
responsibilities and duties in regard to normal drilling operations as well as emergency<br>
and safety procedures. He or She should thoroughly understand and be able to use<br>
with accuracy all safety equipment while performing their normal duties, if the<br>
circumstances should arise. He or She should therefore, familiarize themselves with<br>
the location of all safety equipment and check to see that it is properly stored, easily<br>
accessible at all times, and routinely maintained.<br>
It is the intention of OASIS PETROLEUM and the drilling contractor to make every effort<br>
to provide adequate safeguards against harm to persons on the rig and in the<br>
immediate vicinity from the effects of hydrogen sulfide, which may be released into the<br>
atmosphere under emergency conditions. However, the initiative rest with the<br>
suggestions of the individuals involved in the drilling of these wells are highly welcomed<br>
and act as a fundamental tool for providing the safest working conditions possible.<br>
The drilling foreman is required to enforce these procedures. They are set up for<br>
your safety and the safety of all others.<br>
PURPOSE<br>
It is OASIS PETROLEUM intent to provide a safe work place, not only for its<br>
employees, but also for those other firms who are aiding in the drilling of this well.<br>
There is a possibility of encountering toxic hydrogen sulfide gas. Safety<br>
procedures must be adhered to in order to protect all personnel connected with the<br>
operation, as well as people living within the area.<br>
OASIS PETROLEUM foreman must enforce what may seem to be stringent<br>
requirements. This job will become easier. Carefully study the following pages<br>
and use COMMON SENSE.<br>

<A name=73></a>OPERATING PROCEDURES<br>
GENERAL<br>
Before this H2S contingency plan becomes operational, the drilling contractor's<br>
personnel, necessary service company personnel, and the operator's personnel shall be<br>
thoroughly trained in the use of breathing equipment, emergency procedures, and H2S<br>
procedures. Initial H2S training shall be completed and all H2S related safety<br>
equipment shall be installed, tested and operational when drilling reaches a depth of<br>
500 feet above, or three days, whichever is sooner, prior to penetrating the first zone<br>
containing or reasonably expected to contain H2S. OASIS PETROLEUM shall keep a<br>
list of all personnel who have been through the special training programs on the drill<br>
site. The Safety Company shall supply this list as the personnel are trained.<br>
THROUGHOUT THIS CONTINGENCY PLAN, BREATHING APPARATUS SHALL BE<br>
UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN:<br>
1) Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (Scott IIA or equivalent)<br>

e. Mud Hopper and Bulk Hopper<br>
f. Any hazardous location will be accessible by hose and work pack.<br>
All service companies to be used on the drill site will be notified of the potential<br>
hazard and will furnish safety equipment for their personnel. No service company<br>
employee will be allowed to work on the drill site without having breathing equipment<br>
and training.<br>
The OASIS PETROLEUM drilling foreman will be responsible for hiring a<br>
qualified SAFETY COMPANY to install the H2S continuous gas monitor detection<br>
system. In the event that H2S is detected, or when drilling in a zone containing H2S,<br>
the units will be tested every 12 hours. This monitor will be maintained and tested as<br>
required by the qualified SAFETY COMPANY.<br>
10<br>
<hr>
<A name=75></a>DRILLS<br>
Drills will be held as often as necessary to acquaint the crews and service<br>
company personnel with their responsibilities and the proper procedures to shut-in a<br>
well. After the OASIS PETROLEUM drilling foreman is satisfied with the drilling<br>
procedures, a drill will be conducted weekly for all personnel in each working crew.<br>
The initial training sessions shall include a review of the drilling operations plan.<br>
A qualified SAFETY COMPANY will be on duty when drilling begins or as<br>
otherwise deemed necessary. He will conduct safety talks and instructions of the<br>
drilling foreman. All personnel allowed on the drill site during drilling or testing<br>
operations will be instructed in the use of breathing equipment until supervisory<br>
personnel are satisfied that they are capable of using it.<br>
After familiarization, each rig crew should perform a drill with breathing<br>
equipment. The drill should include getting the breathing equipment, putting it on, and a<br>
short work period. A record shall be kept of the crew members drill in the driver's log or<br>
equivalent.<br>
Proper protective breathing apparatus shall be readily accessible to all essential<br>
personnel. Escape and pressure demand type working equipment shal be provided for<br>
essential personnel in the H2S environment to maintain or regain control of the well.<br>
Rig crews and service company personnel shall be made aware of the location of spare<br>
air bottles, the resuscitation equipment, portable fire extinguishers, and H2S detectors.<br>
Knowledge of the location of the H2S monitor is vital in determining a sour gas location<br>
and the severity of the emergency situation. In addition, key personnel shall be trained<br>
in the use of a resuscitator.<br>
Personal H2S detection devices shall be available for use by all working<br>
personnel. After any device has initially detected H2S, periodic inspections of areas of<br>
poor ventilation shall be made with a portable H2S detection instrument.<br>

SAFETY PROGRAM<br>
DRILL SITE<br>
1. The drilling rig should be located to allow prevailing winds to blow across the<br>
rig toward the reserve pit.<br>
2. Two briefing areas shall be designed for assembly of personnel during<br>
emergency conditions. The briefing areas will be located a minimum of 150<br>
feet<br>
from the well bore and one of the briefing areas shall be upwind of<br>
the well at all times. The briefing area located most normally upwind shall be<br>
designated as the &quot;Briefing Area&quot;. Personnel will assemble at the most<br>
upwind station under alarm conditions, or when so ordered by OASIS<br>
PETROLEUM foreman or the qualified SAFETY COMPANY. Windsocks shall<br>
be installed at prominent locations and shall be visible from all principal<br>
working areas at all times so that wind direction can easily be determined.<br>
3. Warning signs will be posted on the access road to the location. "No<br>
Smoking" signs will be posted as well. The condition sign shall be placed a<br>
minimum of 200 feet but no more than 500 feet from the well site. When H2S<br>
is detected in excess of 10 PPM at any detection point, a red flag shall be<br>
displayed, and all personnel shall wear a Breathing Apparatus.<br>
4. Swabbing or drillstem testing fluids containing H2S will flow through a<br>
separator to permit flaring of gas. There will be a pilot light for any possible<br>
flared gas.<br>
5. One multi-channel automatic H2S monitor will be provided by Oilind Safety<br>
the detector heads will be at the shale shaker, bell nipple, rig floor, and other<br>
hazardous areas. The H2S continuous monitor system shall automatically<br>
activate visible and audible alarms when the ambient air concentration H2S<br>
reaches limits of 10 and 20 PPM in the air, respectively. Should the alarm be<br>
shut off to silence the siren, the blinker light must continue to warn of H2S<br>
presence. The safety representative will continuously monitor the detectors<br>
and will reactivate the alarms if H2S concentrations increase to a dangerous<br>
level.<br>
6. An escape road should be provided which is to be used only in an<br>
emergency.<br>
7. Explosion proof electric fans (bug blowers) will be positioned to insure<br>
adequate circulation at all critical locations if necessary.<br>

<A name=82></a>IGNITING THE WELL<br>
RESPONSIBILITY<br>
1. The decision to ignite the well is the responsibility of OASIS PETROLEUM<br>
foreman. In his/her absence or incapacity, the contractor's Tool Pusher<br>
assumes his/her responsibilities. In their absence or incapacity, the Contract<br>
Driller will be in charge.<br>
2. The decision to ignite the well is to be made as a last resort when it is clear<br>
that;<br>
A. There is a definite threat to human life and property.<br>
B. There is no hope of containing the well under prevailing conditions.<br>
C. Time and circumstances permitting, an attempt should be made to notify<br>
the area office. If human life is threatened, the decision must not be<br>
delayed.<br>
INSTRUCTIONS FOR IGNITING THE WELL<br>
1. Two people are required for the actual igniting operation. Both people will<br>
wear self-contained breathing units and will have 200 foot retrieval ropes tied<br>
around their waist. One person is responsible for checking the atmosphere<br>
for explosive gases with an explosion meter. The other is assigned special<br>
duties within the &quot;Safe Briefing Area&quot;. Those in the &quot;Safe Briefing Area&quot; will<br>
be on alert to the needs of the two people assigned to ignite the well. Should<br>
fumes overcome either of these people, they will immediately pull him to<br>
safety by the retrieval ropes.<br>
2. The primary method for igniting the well is a 25mm meteor type flare gun. It<br>
has a range of approximately 500 feet. If this method fails or well conditions<br>
are such that a safer or better method is apparent, then the alternate method<br>
should be used.<br>
3. If the well is ignited, the burning hydrogen sulfide will be converted to sulfur<br>
dioxide which is also poisonous. Therefore, DO NOT ASSUME THAT THE<br>
AREA IS SAFE AFTER THE GAS IS IGNITED. CONTINUE TO OBSERVE<br>
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS OF<br>
YOUR SUPERVISORS.<br>

Well File # 29176<br>
Dear Richard:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23021, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft5">200' setback </span><span class="ft4">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft5">500' setback </span><span class="ft4">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the<br>
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 17 &amp; 20 T150N R100W. </span><span class="ft6">Tool error is not required pursuant to<br>
order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to a drainage adjacent to the wellsite, an onsite inspection is required.<br>
Contact NDIC Field Inspector for site specific stipulations. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof<br>
container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the<br>
well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration<br>
operations are conducted. XTO ENERGY INC must contact NDIC Field Inspector Caitlin Simpkins at<br>
701-770-9609 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum<br>
legal coordinates from the well head are: 10025 N &amp; 1760 E.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given<br>
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division,<br>
Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,<br>
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.<br>
and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours<br>
or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey<br>
contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.<br>
Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director<br>
may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft1">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is<br>
hereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing<br>
on the date the well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well<br>
records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall<br>
permit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or<br>
controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to<br>
have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect<br>
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time<br>
upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and<br>
shall be available only to the Commission and its staff.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft3">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

Logging, DST and Coring Program<br>
1. A mud log will be run from Base of Last Salt to TD &amp; on all laterals: Mudlog to include: total gas chromatograph and sample cuttings -<br>
30' sample intervals in vertical hole &amp; 30' intervals in laterals. A CBL/GR log will be run from deepest free-fall depth in 7 inch casing to<br>
surface. An MWD GR/ROP log will also be run from KOP (where the CBL will tie into) to TD of lateral.<br>
2. </span><span class="ft11">Open hole logs are not anticipated for this well .<br>
3. No DST's are planned at this time.<br>
H2S </span><span class="ft13">All H2S related safety equipment must be installed, tested and operational at a depth of 500 feet above, or 3 days prior to penetrating the first zone expected to<br>
contain H2S (whichever comes first). H2S may be present in Mission Canyon formation. H2S trailer will be rigged up prior to penetrating the Mission Canyon<br>
through running and cementing the 7&quot; casing.<br>
Maximum Formation Pressure and Temp<br>
1. Normal formation pressure gradient is expected (up to 0.5 psi/ft or 9.6 ppg) from surface to the Bakken Shale. The Bakken Shale, Bakken<br>
Middle Member, and Three Forks may be over pressured up as much as 0.66 psi/ft (12.8 ppg).<br>
2. The maximum anticipated BHST is </span><span class="ft3">260 </span><span class="ft4">degrees F. or less.<br>
BOP Equipment Requirements<br>
See attached diagram detailing BOPE specifications.<br>
1. Rig will be equipped with upper and lower kelly cocks with handles available.<br>
2. Inside BOP and TIW valves will be available to use on all sizes and threads of DP used on well.<br>
3. BOP accumulator will have enough capacity to close HCR valve, close all rams plus annular preventer &amp; retain minimum of 200 psi<br>
above precharge on the closing manifold without the use of closing pumps. The fluid reservoir capacity shall be at least double the usable<br>
fluid volume of the accumulator system capacity &amp; the fluid level shall be mainatained at manufacturer's recommendation. There will be 2<br>
additional sources of power for the closing pumps (electric and air). Sufficient N2 bottles will be available and will be recharged when<br>
pressure falls below manufacturer's minimum<br>
4. BOP ram preventers will be tested to 5,000 psi for 10 minutes using a test plug when initially installed and after 7 inch casing is nippled up<br>
and at 30 day intervals. Test BOP &amp; casing strings to .22 psi/ft (or 1500 psi minimum) for 30 minutes, prior to drilling out<br>
9-5/8&quot; and 7&quot; casing. Function test rams and hydraulically operated remote choke line valve daily (preferably at every crew change).<br>
5. Remote valve for BOP rams, HCR &amp; choke shall be placed in a location that is readily available to Driller. The remote BOP valve shall<br>
be capable of closing and opening the rams.<br>
6. Hand wheels on BOP shall be equipped with locking devices. A locking device shall be placed on annular preventer line valve &amp; must be<br>
locked in the open position. This lock shall only be removed when the closing unit is inoperative.<br>
7. BOP shall be tested when - a.) Initially installed b.) Any seal is broken or BOP is repaired c.) Previous test exceeds 30 days<br>
Drilling Fluid and Related Equipment<br>
1. Pumps shall be equipped with stroke counters with displays located in dog house. Slow pump speed shall be recorded on drilling report<br>
daily after mudding up.<br>
2. A Pit Volume Totalizer will be installed and the readout will be displayed in the dog house.<br>
3. Gas detecting equipment (for a chromatagraph) will be installed at shaker. Readouts will be available in dog house and in geologist trailer.<br>
4. In the event gas flow becomes an issue. A flare pit shall be constructed not less than 100' from wellhead &amp; 50' from cuttings handling area.<br>
Lines to the flare pit will be straight runs (staked down) and turns will utilize targeted tees. Flare pit will be located down wind as much as<br>
possible. An electronic ignitor will be used along with a propane line to provide for a continuous flare pilot.<br>

Cherry Creek 40 MMCFD; Garden Creek 35 MMCFD; NW MCK 30 MMCFD<br>
3d. Est. Thru-put 1st Sales<br>
Cherry Creek &amp; Garden Creek Area 95 MMCFD total forecasted based on known wells<br>
3e. Gas Gatherer Area Plans<br>
The Lonesome Creek plant (online Q4 2015) will add 200 MMCFD processing capacity to this area.<br>
NW McKenzie station expected to start up mid 2015.<br>
4a. Est. 1st Prod Date<br>
5/15, 5/17, 5/19, 5/20/2015 for the D, H, C, G wells respectively<br>
4b. Est. Flowback Rates/Times<br>
3 days at 3000mcfd+2200bopd for each well<br>
44% for XTO in June 2014 . Note: XTO has 96% of wells in ND connected to gas pipeline. The<br>
5a. State Flare %<br>
remaining 4% have approved exemptions or extensions.<br>
5b. Field Flare %<br>
49% XTO in June 2014 (8 XTO Wells in Arnegard field)<br>
If the wells are not connected to a gas pipeline within field or NDIC specified time limit of first<br>
production, and it is economical based in gas composition and contract terms, a temporary gas<br>
liquefaction unit will be installed until such time that a gas line is in place.<br>
6a. Flaring Alternatives<br>
Approx. 16% by volume (source: ProGas Services Simulation, Sorkness State 34x-36 well, Dec 2013)<br>

Dunn County<br>
Well File # 30145<br>
Dear Rebecca:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 25107, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval<br>
is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' setback<br>
from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit<br>
consisting of Sections 28 &amp; 33 T143N R96W. </span><span class="ft4">Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit<br>
must be provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their<br>
property of the cuttings generated from drilling the wells into an offsite spacing unit. OXY may set<br>
conductor on permitted wells only. OXY USA Inc. must ensure the drilling pit is not constructed in fill dirt.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be<br>
maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out,<br>
completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. OXY USA INC must contact NDIC<br>
Field Inspector Nicole Nelson at 701-290-1527 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling<br>
and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent<br>
pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are<br>
prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill<br>
cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is:<br>
607 N. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 10764<br>
N.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be<br>
waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to<br>
evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that<br>
would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the<br>
applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that<br>
notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas<br>
Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit<br>
number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00<br>
p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours<br>
or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall<br>
file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be<br>
submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the<br>
directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the<br>
director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a<br>
certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or<br>
when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours,<br>
and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the<br>
plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well<br>
bore, and (3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic<br>
cement evaluation log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior<br>
to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format)<br>
copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or<br>
attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft3">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

<A name=25></a>Pad<br>
The six wells that will be located on the William Sadowsky NENE 4 Pad are shown in the table<br>
below.<br>
This gas capture plan will be for the wells that will be connected to ONEOK's low pressure<br>
gathering system.<br>
Pipeline Notification<br>
The wells that will be connected to ONEOK's low pressure gathering system in Dunn County,<br>
North Dakota are the Schneider 8-33-28H-143-96, Schneider 9-33-28H-143-96 and Schneider<br>
10-33-28H-143-96. Oxy's acreage that comprises the spacing unit (SU) for the Schneider 8-33-<br>
28H-143-96, Schneider 9-33-28H-143-96 and Schneider 10-33-28H-143-96 is dedicated to<br>
ONEOK. Under terms of the contract, ONEOK is obligated to install the facilities that are<br>
required to connect these wells to its gathering system. Oxy provides (on a monthly basis) to<br>
ONEOK a drilling, completion and estimated first production date for all wells that are<br>
scheduled to be drilled in the foreseeable future. In addition, Oxy and ONEOK have conference<br>
calls, usually bi-weekly, to discuss connection status of wells and changes to Oxy's drilling and<br>
completion schedules.<br>
Gathering System<br>
ONEOK's gathering system in this area is a dynamic system that has multiple compressor<br>
stations with common suction lines. Gas produced from this pad will have a primary flow path<br>
to ONEOK's Lodgepole compressor station and secondary flow paths to ONEOK's Killdeer and<br>
Little Knife compressor stations. The actual flow of the gas will be based on compression<br>
operating parameters and gathering system pressures. Gas gathered on this part of ONEOK's<br>
gathering system is processed at ONEOK's Grassland Processing Plant located in Section 36,<br>
T146N, R105W, McKenzie County, North Dakota.<br>
In addition to ONEOK, Hiland will have a low pressure gathering line connected to facilities on<br>
the William Sadowsky NENE 4 Pad location. Hiland's lines, along with ONEOK's, are shown<br>
on the attached map.<br>

<hr>
<A name=26></a>The production facilities for the Schneider 8-33-28H-143-96, Schneider 9-33-28H-143-96 and<br>
Schneider 10-28-33H-143-96 will be located approximately 500' south of ONEOK's existing<br>
12.75" outside diameter (OD) low pressure gathering system. The connection to ONEOK will<br>
require approximately 500' of either 4.50" or 6.625" OD low pressure gathering line and related<br>
facilities.<br>
Existing Lines<br>
At the terminus of the metering, associated piping at each well's production facilities and the<br>
500' of 4.50" or 6.625" OD low pressure gathering line noted above, a connection will be made<br>
to an existing 12.75" OD gathering line. This 12.75" OD gathering line traverses approximately<br>
1.5 miles before connecting to a 16" OD gathering line. The gas then travels approximately 27.0<br>
miles before being compressed at ONEOK's Lodgepole compressor station. This will be the<br>
primary flow path of gas delivered to ONEOK from this pad.<br>
As noted under "Gathering<br>
System", above, the gas will have secondary flow paths due to the dynamics of ONEOK's<br>
gathering system.<br>
The table below shows the capacities and current flows of the primary<br>
gathering lines connecting this well.<br>
ONEOK's low pressure gathering system is near capacity in this area due to continuing<br>
development of the fields in this area. It is projected that the system will have capacity when<br>
these wells are ready for production due to decline on the existing wells gathered on this segment<br>
of the system and ONEOK's continuing efforts to maximize flow on its gathering system(s).<br>
ONEOK is in the process of adding compressors at its Lost Bridge compressor station in Section<br>
14, T147N, R96W, Dunn County and installing a 16" OD low pressure gathering line that will<br>
start in T145N, R94W, Dunn County (Dunn Center) and end at the inlet of the Lost Bridge<br>
compressor station. Construction of these facilities will redirect gas that currently flows on the<br>
primary and secondary flow paths of the William Sadowsky NENE 4 Pad (ONEOK) to flow on<br>
the new facilities. Although this does not directly increase the capacity of the primary and<br>
secondary flow paths of the William Sadowsky NENE 4 Pad (ONEOK), it redirects gas that<br>
currently flows on the same pipelines to a different compressor station, in essence reducing<br>
volumes transported on the flow paths for this well. ONEOK is also planning on constructing a<br>
new discharge line from its Lost Bridge compressor station that will deliver some of the gas<br>
currently processed at ONEOK's Grasslands Processing Plant to ONEOK's Garden Creek<br>
Processing Plant(s).<br>
4<br>
<hr>
<A name=27></a>ONEOK has announced plans to construct the Bear Creek natural gas processing plant and<br>
related natural gas and natural gas liquids infrastructure in Dunn County, North Dakota. The<br>
Bear Creek natural gas processing plant and related facilities are expected to be operation during<br>
the second quarter of 2016. In addition, ONEOK Demicks Lake natural gas processing plant,<br>
located in McKenzie County, North Dakota, is expected to be operational during the third quarter<br>
of 2016.<br>
Flowback Strategy<br>
After the fracture treatment, these wells will be flowed through a choke to test production tanks.<br>
Choke size will depend on final shut in pressure post frac and well pressure prior to opening the<br>
choke. The choke will be adjusted up or down based on flowing pressure, liquid rates and sand<br>
returns, to prevent clogging manifold chokes. During flowback, the water chlorides and sand<br>
content will be monitored. When the water chlorides are greater than 100,000 ppm and the<br>
produced fluids contain no sand, the wells will be turned to production facilities. Since the<br>
pipeline is already at the location of the pad and Oxy will have its production facilities<br>
constructed before flowback starts, and gas sales should start as soon as the wells start flowing<br>
through the production facilities, unless there are capacity issues on ONEOK's system at that<br>
time. Based on current information, it is our belief the system can take this gas upon completion<br>
of the three wells.<br>
The typical well on this pad will initially flow 445 barrels of oil and 200 thousand cubic feet of<br>
gas per day based on Oxy's production type curve of this area. Based on current drilling and<br>
completion plans, these wells will be completed in the same timeframe. For the three wells that<br>
will be connected to ONEOK's gathering system, Oxy projects a peak oil rate of 1,335 barrels<br>
and a peak gas rate of 600 thousand cubic feet per day from the pad. It is anticipated these wells<br>
will decline sharply after initial production as do the majority of horizontal wells in the Williston<br>
Basin.<br>
Current Flaring<br>
The table below shows gas produced and sold by Oxy per Gas Production Report - Form 5B that<br>
was filed by Oxy for August 2014 reporting period. The percent sold and percent flared are also<br>
shown in the table.<br>
5<br>
<hr>
<A name=28></a>Flaring<br>
Wells on this pad will be connected to a pipeline prior to production and Oxy does not expect to<br>
flare gas. Below are three alternatives that Oxy considered from a conceptual standpoint to<br>
reduce the amount of gas flared. More generally, Oxy is continuing to review the possible<br>
impact of implementing one or more of these alternatives as appropriate in our operations.<br>
1) NGL Removal ­ On Lease<br>
Captures highest value components in gas stream<br>
Plants are expensive<br>
Uneconomical to operate when volume declines<br>
Residue gas is still flared<br>
2) Power Generation ­ On Lease<br>
Savings if current generation's fuel supply is diesel<br>
Only a portion of gas is consumed operating the generator, remainder of gas will<br>
be flared<br>
Due to gas quality, high NGL content, preference is to purchase power from the<br>
grid and not operate generation on site<br>
3) Compressed Natural Gas ­ On lease<br>
Well site compressors are required to fill CNG trailers<br>
Large capital outlay for equipment and operating cost, includes trucking of<br>
products, are expensive<br>
No gas would be flared, but might be uneconomical to operate when gas volume<br>
declines<br>

I, William H. Dolinar, Professional Land Surveyor, ND. RLS #6550, hereby certify that (in accordance with a request from Cody Dennison with Oxy USA, Inc., 3239 Highway<br>
22, Dickinson, North Dakota 58601) I and/or personnel under my direction made a survey on the 6th day of August 2014, for the Surface Hole Location and Elevation of platted<br>
well, being located within Lot 1 of Section 4, T142N, R96W of the 5th P.M., Dunn County, State of North Dakota.<br>
Notes: All Azimuths are based on the North line of the Northeast Quarter of Section 4, T142N, R96W of the 5th P.M., being an Azimuth of 269°46'41&quot; using GPS<br>
observations, occupying a WHS control point (5/8" rebar) and having the Location and Elevation derived from an OPUS Solution and GEOID 09. Azimuths shown have been<br>
rotated 1°43'25.54678&quot; West from SPC Grid bearings to Geodetic North, based on convergence angle provided by a conversion using Corpscon.<br>
Project elevations are held on the control point located 173°54'36&quot;, 4.48 feet from the Northwest Corner of Section 4, T142N, R96W of the 5th P.M. having a NAVD 88<br>
elevation of 2421.44 feet.<br>
Distances shown are Ground Distances using a combined scale factor of 1.000161758.<br>
Location shown here on is not an "ASBUILT" location.<br>

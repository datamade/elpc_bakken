RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>
Assistant Director<br>

PERMIT STIPULATION<br>
Dear OPERATOR:<br>
The below stipulation is applicable to all of the permits on the enclosed list.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be<br>
maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out,<br>
completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted.<br>

Well File # 23158<br>
Dear William:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 15720, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the<br>
200' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft2">500' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280<br>
acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 17 &amp; 20 T146N R92W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: IN CASES WHERE A SPACING UNIT IS ACCESSED FROM AN OFF-SITE<br>
DRILL PAD, AN AFFIDAVIT MUST BE PROVIDED AFFIRMING THAT THE SURFACE OWNER OF<br>
THE MULTI-WELL PAD AGREES TO ACCEPT BURIAL ON THEIR PROPERTY OF THE CUTTINGS<br>
GENERATED FROM DRILLING THE WELL(S) INTO AN OFFSITE SPACING/DRILLING UNIT.<br>
MARATHON OIL CO MUST CONTACT NDIC FIELD INSPECTOR DENA BERGSTEDT AT 701-202-<br>
4114 PRIOR TO LOCATION CONSTRUCTION.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling<br>
and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent<br>
pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are<br>
prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill<br>
cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing<br>
point is: 500' north. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well<br>
head is: 10618' north.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary<br>
to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information<br>
that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit,<br>
the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
<hr>
<A name=17></a>Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given<br>
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division,<br>
Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,<br>
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and<br>
1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours or on the<br>
weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey<br>
contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.<br>
Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft1">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or<br>
when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is<br>
hereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing on<br>
the date the well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well records<br>
wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall permit the<br>
Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or controlled by<br>
them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to have access at all<br>
times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect producing and drilling<br>
wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time upon request. The<br>
information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and shall be available only to<br>
the Commission and its staff.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours,<br>
and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling<br>
the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of cement<br>
can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma Ray Log must<br>
be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as one paper copy and<br>
one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image logs that include, but are<br>
not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced in their entirety as LAS<br>
(Log ASCII) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to follow when submitting image<br>
logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The<br>
TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file<br>
format. The digital copy may be submitted on a standard CD, or attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft1">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

BOP EQUIPMENT<br>
Marathon Oil Company's minimum specifications for pressure<br>
control equipment are as follows:<br>
Ram Type:<br>
13 5/8" 5000 psi blind, pipe and annular.<br>
a. Due to Marathon's experience it is felt that the above<br>
referenced BOP equipment is adequate for drilling this well.<br>
The reduced permeability of the target zone along with<br>
Marathon's area experience of drilling over 150 horizontal<br>
wells indicate that a MASP of 3000 psi is more adjusted to<br>
the reality of the reservoir.<br>
BOP and other equipment testing:<br>
a. Floor valve, dart valve, kill valves, check valve, manual<br>
choke line valve, manual top drive valve, hydraulic top<br>
drive valve, HCR, choke house valves, choke manifold,<br>
choke hose, choke line, kill line, upper pipe rams, lower<br>
pipe rams, blind rams (Low Test: 250 psi x 5 min. High<br>
Test: 5000 psi x 10 min.)<br>
b. Annular Preventer (Low Test: 250 psi x 5 min. High Test:<br>
2500 psi x 10 min.)<br>
c. Rotating head and Orbit Valve (Low Test: 250 psi x 5 min.<br>
High Test: 1500 psi x 10 min.)<br>
Frequency:<br>
a. After initial installation (NU BOPE).<br>
b. Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken</span><span class="ft5">.<br>
c. After any repairs compromising seal</span><span class="ft5">.<br>
d. At 30-day intervals.<br>
All other equipment (upper and lower Kelly cocks, IBOP,<br>
etc) will be tested according to Onshore Oil and Gas<br>
Order No. 2.<br>

RE:<br>
HORIZONTAL WELL<br>
H. BORSTAD 3<br>
SESE Section 3-157N-95W<br>
Williams County<br>
Well File # 18185<br>
Dear BRADFORD :<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 13108, approval to drill the above captioned well is<br>
hereby given. The approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not<br>
isolated by cement, be no closer than the 500' setback within the 320 acre spacing unit<br>
consisting of S/2 SECTION 3.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that<br>
notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should<br>
be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information<br>
must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company<br>
representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00<br>
p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if<br>
after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that)<br>
the survey contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge<br>
within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a<br>
form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to<br>
be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the<br>
director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one<br>
adobe document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft5">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft1">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the<br>
well bore.<br>

Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his<br>
representatives, is hereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain<br>
confidential for six months commencing on the date the well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access<br>
to all well records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing<br>
work for your company shall permit the Director and his representatives to come upon any<br>
lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or controlled by them, complying with all safety<br>
rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to have access at all times<br>
to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect<br>
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available<br>
to them at any time upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall<br>
be maintained in strict confidence and shall be available only to the Commission and its<br>
staff.<br>
Reserve pit<br>
Please be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling<br>
reserve pit on this site if specific site conditions warrant.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500<br>
psi within 12 hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum<br>
compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the<br>
presence of cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate<br>
casing has been set and a Gamma Ray Log must be run from total depth to ground level<br>
elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as one paper copy and one digital<br>
copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image logs that<br>
include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot<br>
be produced in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a solution and establish a<br>
standard format for industry to follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given<br>
approval for the operator to submit an image log as a TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF<br>
(*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its entirety as a LAS<br>
(Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5" floppy diskette, a<br>
standard CD, or attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>
Thank you for your<br>
cooperation.<br>

NOTE: A Gamma Ray log must be run to ground surface and a CBL must be run on intermediate or longstring casing string if set.<br>
Surveys are required at least every 30 feet in the build section and every 90 feet in the lateral section of a horizontal well. Measurement<br>
inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the<br>
following scenarios: 1) When both the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less and the well bore is within<br>
150 feet of the respective setback requirement; or 2) If industry standard methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field<br>
order for exceptions.<br>
If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2 MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well<br>
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>
Assistant Director<br>

PERMIT STIPULATION<br>
Dear OPERATOR:<br>
The below stipulation is applicable to all of the permits on the enclosed list.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be<br>
maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out,<br>
completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted.<br>

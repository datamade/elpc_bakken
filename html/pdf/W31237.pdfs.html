Dear Michael:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24826, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is granted on the condition that all<br>
portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' </span><span class="ft1">setback from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' </span><span class="ft1">setback from the east &amp;<br>
west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 14 &amp; 23 T154N R98W. </span><span class="ft3">Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be maintained on<br>
the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration<br>
operations are conducted. Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location. Whiting may set<br>
conductor on permitted wells only. Be advised the P Wood 154-98-16-23-15-1H well is within 92 feet of the proposed wellbore for the Carscallen<br>
31-14-2TFH well. Precautions must be taken while designing the frac job for the Carscallen 31-14-2TFH well as to not adversely affect the P<br>
Wood 154-98-16-23-15-1H well. Be advised the P Wood 154-98-15-23-15-3H well is within 83 feet of the proposed wellbore for the Carscallen 31-<br>
14-2TFH well. Precautions must be taken while designing the frac job for the Carscallen 31-14-2TFH well as to not adversely affect the P Wood<br>
154-98-15-23-15-3H well. Be advised the P Wood 154-98-15-23-15-3HA well is within 85 feet of the proposed wellbore for the Carscallen 31-14-<br>
2TFH well. Precautions must be taken while designing the frac job for the Carscallen 31-14-2TFH well as to not adversely affect the P Wood<br>
154-98-15-23-15-3HA well. Be advised the P Wood 154-98-15-23-15-2H well is within 126 feet of the proposed wellbore for the Carscallen 31-14-<br>
2TFH well. Precautions must be taken while designing the frac job for the Carscallen 31-14-2TFH well as to not adversely affect the P Wood<br>
154-98-15-23-15-2H well. Be advised the P Wood 154-98-15-23-15-2HA well is within 120 feet of the proposed wellbore for the Carscallen 31-14-<br>
2TFHwell. Precautions must be taken while designing the frac job for the Carscallen 31-14-2TFH well as to not adversely affect the P Wood<br>
154-98-15-23-15-2HA well. Be advised the P Jorgenson 154-98-5-14-23-16H well is within 107 feet of the proposed wellbore for the Carscallen 31-<br>
14-2TFH well. Precautions must be taken while designing the frac job for the Carscallen 31-14-2TFH well as to not adversely affect the P<br>
Jorgenson 154-98-5-14-23-16H well. WHITING OIL AND GAS CORP must contact NDIC Field Inspector Tamara Cook at 701-770-1855 prior<br>
to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion operations, providing<br>
the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud<br>
system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings<br>
and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The proposed directional plan is at a legal<br>
location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 9852'S.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit on the NDIC -<br>
OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity<br>
Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to<br>
evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that would allow the Director to conclude<br>
that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that notification be given immediately upon<br>
the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be<br>
included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to<br>
12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys<br>
with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director.<br>
However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the<br>
director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a certification cover page to<br>
certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Conductors, Rat holes, and Mouse holes <br>
To protect near surface groundwater any conductor, rat, or mouse hole drilled must be constructed with a string of casing and cemented to ground <br>
level.  Any such string must be secured at the surface when not in use.  In addition, all rat and mouse holes must be plugged with cement and cut off at least 4' <br>
below final grade within a reasonable timeframe after the rig completes drilling operations on the pad. <br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement utilized on<br>
production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones can be determined,<br>
(2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be<br>
determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run<br>
prior to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>

PRESSURE CONTROL EQUIPMENT<br>
A. Type:<br>
Eleven (11) inch double gate hydraulic BOP with eleven (11) inch annular preventer<br>
with 5,000 psi Casinghead and 5,000 psi Tubinghead.<br>
B. Testing Procedure:<br>
The annular preventer will be pressure tested to 50% of stack rated working pressure for ten (10)<br>
minutes or until provisions of test are met, whichever is longer. The BOP, choke manifold, and<br>
related equipment will be pressure tested to approved BOP stack working pressure (if isolated from<br>
surface casing by a test plug) or to 70% of surface casing internal yield strength (if BOP is not<br>
isolated by a test plug). Pressure will be maintained for ten (10) minutes or until the requirements of<br>
the test are met, whichever is longer. At a minimum, the Annular and Blow-Out Preventer pressure<br>
tests will be performed:<br>
1.<br>
When the BOPE is initially installed;<br>
2.<br>
Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken;<br>
3.<br>
Following related repairs; and<br>
4.<br>
At thirty (30) day intervals.<br>
Annular will be function tested weekly, and pipe &amp; blind rams activated each trip, but not more than<br>
once per day. All BOP drills &amp; tests will be recorded in IADC driller's log.<br>
C.<br>
Choke Manifold Equipment:<br>
All choke lines will be straight lines whenever possible, at turns tee blocks will be used or will be<br>
targeted with running tees, and will be anchored to prevent whip and vibration.<br>
D.<br>
Accumulator:<br>
Accumulator will have sufficient capacity to open hydraulically-controlled choke line valve (if so<br>
equipped), close all rams plus annular preventer, and retain a minimum of 200 psi above precharge on<br>
the closing manifold without the use of closing unit pumps. The fluid reservoir capacity will be<br>
double accumulator capacity and the fluid level will be maintained at manufacturer's<br>
recommendations. Accumulator precharge pressure test will be conducted prior to connecting the<br>
closing unit to the BOP stack.<br>
E.<br>
Miscellaneous Information:<br>
Choke manifold and BOP extension rods with hand wheels will be located outside rig sub-structure.<br>
Hydraulic BOP closing unit will be located at least twenty-five (25) feet from the wellhead but readily<br>
accessible to the driller. Exact locations and configurations of the hydraulic BOP closing unit will<br>
depend upon the particular rig contracted to drill this hole.<br>
A flare line will be installed after the choke manifold with the discharge point of the flare line to a<br>
separate pit located at least 125 feet away from the wellbore and any existing production facilities.<br>

<A name=26></a>Whiting Petroleum<br>
Typical Completion Procedure<br>
Bakken or Three Forks<br>
After Drilling Rig Moves Off Location<br>
1. MIRU wire line, RIH with gauge ring to at least 100 ft beyond liner top, POOH.<br>
2. RIH and set retrievable plug in liner hanger or in completion liner, POOH with wireline. Run<br>
CBL, CCL, GR and casing inspection tool from liner top to surface.<br>
3. Pressure test 7" (intermediate) casing and frac valve.<br>
4. MI and fill (with fresh water) a sufficient number of frac tanks to ensure there will be enough<br>
water for the designed frac job.<br>
5. MIRU flowback company, rig flowback separator (4 phase) and flowback iron from wellhead to<br>
pit.<br>
6. MIRU all frac company equipment, RU all equipment necessary to frac well.<br>
7. Pumping frac job as per design.<br>
8. Flowback crew returns to location, inspects and conducts pressure test on all flowback<br>
equipment/iron. Begin flowback of well - 24 hrs/day operation.<br>
9. After flowback testing, direct full well stream to production battery.<br>
10. RD and MO flowback equipment and crew.<br>
11. Turn well over to production department.<br>
Note:<br>
If casing inspection log or indicates excessive wear in 7" casing or other conditions require a frac<br>
string to be run, the CBL, GR, CCL and casing inspection tool will be run and the 7" casing<br>
pressure tested to a lower rating. After the frac string is run, a retrievable plug will be set and the<br>
frac string tested prior to fracing<br>

This letter is to acknowledge your request for a physical address for oil activity purposes for the<br>
North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC). At this time we cannot provide you a physical<br>
address for the requested location, however, the permit number (NDIC code) assigned to your<br>
project wil serve as the as the primary identifier for addressing and emergency purposes.<br>
According to North Dakota Century Code § 57-40.6-10 (1.d) the County is the authorizing entity<br>
for assignment of rural addressing in conformance with the modified Burkle addressing plan.<br>
When 911 addressing of a well site is not possible, the North Dakota 9-1-1 Association supports<br>
use of the NDIC code as the primary piece of information for locating a well site.<br>
If you have questions or concerns please don't hesitate to contact my office and I wil do whatever<br>
I can to assist your company.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Katie Lima<br>

HORIZONTAL WELL<br>
TI-ARLENE STONE- 157-95-2423H-2<br>
NWSE Section 24-157N-95W<br>
Williams County<br>
Well File # 28723<br>
Dear Rachelle:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23951, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is<br>
granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">1220' </span><span class="ft1">setback (per<br>
Commission order) from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">200' </span><span class="ft1">setback from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1920<br>
acre spacing unit consisting of Section 19 T157N R94W and Sections 23 &amp; 24 T157N R95W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock<br>
disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during<br>
clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. Due to drainage adjacent to<br>
the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location. In order to justify the spacing unit TI-ARLENE<br>
STONE-157-95-2423H-2 must be drilled back to back with TI-ARLENE STONE-157-95-2423H-1.<br>
HESS<br>
BAKKEN INVESTMENT II must contact NDIC Field Inspector Tom Delling at 701-770-8660 prior to location<br>
construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and<br>
completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of<br>
the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be<br>
inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized<br>
in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate<br>
from the well head is: 7035'E.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved<br>
drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd<br>
business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.<br>
Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating<br>
circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that would allow the Director to<br>
conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given immediately<br>
upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The<br>
following information must be included:<br>
Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company<br>
representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time.<br>
Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall<br>
file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be<br>
submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional<br>
survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a<br>
timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a certification cover page to<br>
certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when<br>
sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is hereby<br>
granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing on the date the<br>
well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well records wherever<br>
located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall permit the Director and his<br>
representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or controlled by them, complying with all<br>
safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to have access at all times to any and all records of<br>
wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such<br>
wells shall be made available to them at any time upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be<br>
maintained in strict confidence and shall be available only to the Commission and its staff.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail<br>
cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or<br>
initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>

4. The pad shall be graded and shaped to the lines and grades shown on the plan and profile sheets or as directed in the field by the engineer or construction manager. Wing ditches, turnouts,<br>
culverts and low water crossings shall be constructed where shown, or as needed during field construction. Wing ditch and/or relief culvert locations, shall be field verified and placed as to<br>
minimize erosion and sedimentation of drainages and to promote proper site/ road drainage.<br>
5. Culverts shall be C.M.P. or as specified on the plans. All culverts shall have a min. slope of 2%. Culverts shall be protected as shown on the plan or as deemed necessary, in the field, by the<br>
operator. Culverts shall be monitored for head-cutting, erosion, sedimentation, and plugging.<br>
6. Cattle guards (if required) shall be placed outside of public road right-of-ways on private surface and installed per the manufacture's recommendations.<br>
7. Pad/road compaction shall be achieved by routing construction equipment across fills. Water may have to be added to material to achieve adequate compaction, no fill layer placement shall<br>
exceed an 8&quot; depth. If an argument arises on compaction, the minimum requirements are 95% of standard proctor at +/- 2% optimum moisture.<br>
8. The operator shall monitor construction/use and implement the &quot;best management practices&quot; in their storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) in addition to any erosion controls shown on<br>
the plans. All slopes, ditches, and culvert inlets/outlets shall be protected from storm water erosion, immediately after construction, per the SWPPP. Typically, all slopes 3H:1V or less shall be<br>
stabilized with conventional seeding equipment, and slopes steeper than 3H:1V may require stabilization with hydro-seeding, water bars, and/or erosion control matting or any combination of these.<br>
Typically, road ditches steeper than 5% shall be protected with straw wattles 20' to 100' o.c. Ditches steeper than 8% shall be stabilized with straw wattles 10' to 50' o.c., and in some case, with<br>
wattles over erosion control blankets.<br>

Statewide flaring 23%<br>
Fieldwide flaring 0% (Tioga)<br>
Flaring Alternatives:<br>
Mobile Gas Treatment Units:<br>
 </span><span class="ft1">GTUIT is a mobile flare gas capture technology for remote natural gas liquids (NGLs) extraction and gas<br>
conditioning processes. The systems strips out NGLs from the gas stream and refrigerates them for storage<br>
reducing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) thereby mitigating environmental impacts by significantly<br>
decreasing emissions from flare stacks. The Units can be combined and scaled up to handle high volumes<br>
of gas.<br>
<br>
Hess has contracted with GTUIT to provide mobile gas treatment units (MTUs). As of 6/23/2014, Hess has<br>
five GTUIT units being utilized in the field and expects delivery of three additional units by 8/1/2014. The<br>
units have capacities ranging from 500 MSCFD to 1,000 MSCFD and can be relocated from one site to<br>
another. The units also can be linked onsite to provide a larger daily capacity intake.<br>
<br>
Hess is developing methodologies that will result in an order-of-merit list of candidate sites at which to<br>
deploy the MTUs, based on environmental, regulatory, economic, and operational factors. There are<br>
commercial constraints present which pertain to Hess's commercial agreement with GTUIT; wells must<br>
produce at least half of the MSCFD unit capacity and cover the initial connection fees in order for use of<br>
the GTUIT unit to be economic.<br>
Gas Lift Technology:<br>
<br>
Gas lift technology pushes high pressured gas down a well in order to lift oil that was not obtainable by<br>
other means. A portion of the natural gas produced from the well is cycled through a compressor to<br>
"pressurize" the gas which is then sent down hole. The remaining produced natural gas from the well is<br>
put into sales or flared. The "pressurized" gas returns to the surface with the produced oil and repeats the<br>
cycle. Some gas lift technologies burn part of the produced gas in a reciprocating engine as part of the<br>
compression process. Other gas lift technologies are a closed system which would not reduce any flaring<br>
onsite.<br>
<br>
Hess is not currently utilizing this system because compressed gas is piped from the TGP for gas lift wells.<br>
The company continues to evaluate this technology on remote well locations.<br>
Bi-Fuel Rig Conversion:<br>
<br>
Bi-Fuel Conversion is a process where diesel engines are converted to operate on a combination of diesel<br>
fuel and natural gas.<br>
<br>
Hess has partnered with Nabors Drilling to equip six "PACE B" rigs operating in the Bakken with Bi-Fuel<br>
Kits. GTI Altronics is a retrofit technology allowing diesel engines to operate on a mixture of natural gas<br>
and diesel fuel. Boiler sheds will be converted to run on 100% natural gas during winter operations. The<br>
units have a gas requirement of 50%. The Bi-Fuel System required approximately 75-100 MSCFD and the<br>
boilers require approx. 100-150 MSCFD.<br>
<br>
Hess is unable to utilize this technology on depleted wells lacking gas production. Well surging creating<br>
intermittent gas supply is another issue related to Bi-Fuel usage. Safety is also a concern as the system<br>
requires aboveground gas lines.<br>
Natural Gas Generators:<br>
<br>
Natural Gas Generators are an alternative to diesel generators to provide electricity to well pads located<br>
in remote areas. The units are tied directly into the natural gas production onsite and supplement liquid<br>
propane for use during hourly production fluctuation. Natural gas generators require liquid propane to be<br>
used when gas is not being produced from the well. As production of gas increases and decreases hourly,<br>
the units may switch from propane to natural gas and then back to propane.<br>
<br>
Hess performed two pilot programs to evaluate performance characteristics of natural gas generators<br>
from two manufacturers. Both manufacturers require further development to increase their reliability and<br>
performance of units.<br>
<hr>
<A name=97></a><br>
Economics favor diesel generators over natural gas generators at this time due to cost and reliability. Pilot<br>
program was not able to produce consistent results to move forward with field implementation at this<br>
time. Natural gas generators will continue to be evaluated as an alternative in the future.<br>
Bi-Fuel (Blended) Diesel Generators:<br>
<br>
Bi-Fuel diesel generators are diesel generators with natural gas "makeup" kit (blend kit) allowing units to<br>
use produced gas onsite to power the facility.<br>
<br>
Hess is currently in the conceptual phase of evaluation of Bi-Fuel Diesel Generators.<br>
Fleet Vehicles Bi-Fuel Conversions:<br>
<br>
Similar to the bi-fuel conversion on rigs, individual vehicles can be converted to operate on either<br>
compressed natural gas or gasoline/diesel. The vehicles would run on the compressed natural gas and<br>
then switch to a reserve tank of gasoline or diesel when the natural gas is low.<br>
<br>
Hess is currently in the conceptual phase of evaluation of fleet vehicle bi-fuel conversions. The company is<br>
looking at the possibility of using compressed natural gas from TGP to fuel vehicles. Currently, one<br>
refueling location has been scoped.<br>
<br>
Because there is only one refueling location for compressed natural gas, it would be difficult to make this<br>
project economically viable. Cost savings come from using compressed gas, rather than diesel fuel or<br>
gasoline.<br>
<br>
Individual production facilities are not being considered for use as compressed natural gas stations at this<br>
time.<br>
<br>
Hess will continue to evaluate this technology.<br>

Kirkland 6-7-1-12BHD<br>

Introduction<br>
The Kirkland 6-7-1-12BHD is second of two vertical holes drilled on the pad. It is located in<br>
Croff Field of McKenzie County, ND or more specifically 270' FSL &amp; 260' FWL, SW SW Sec.<br>
7, T149N, R95W. This pad is approximately 19 miles southeast of Watford City, North Dakota.<br>
This is a planned double section, horizontal well targeting the Middle Member of the Bakken<br>
Formation. The Kirkland 6-7-1-12BHD will be the only well on this pad drilled within the<br>
Middle Bakken.<br>
Offset Wells<br>
Offset wells are used in depth and structure correlation throughout the vertical and curve. This<br>
data is crucial in order to establish and correct measurements made throughout the build and<br>
landing of the curve. The primary offset well used to establish these figures was QEP's Kirkland<br>
6-7-1-12T2HD 25' to the east of Kirkland 6-7-1-12BHD, due to its close proximity. The Moberg<br>
3-20/21TH, .2 miles to the northwest and Kirkland 13-23/14H, .4 miles to the northwest were<br>
also used as nearby offset wells.<br>
<hr>
<A name=8></a>Engineering<br>
The Kirkland 6-7-1-12BHD was spud February 15, 2015, and drilled entirely by Unit Drilling<br>
Rig #121. This included a 13 ½" surface hole drilled with fresh water to 2,179', and cased to<br>
2,175' with 9 5/8" casing.<br>
The drilling rig was then skid to the Kirkland 6-7-1-12T2HD for vertical and curve operations.<br>
Unit 121 was then skid back to the Kirkland 6-7-1-12BHD, and on February 28th was re-entered<br>
to resume drilling in the vertical section.<br>
At 10,551' MD the kick off point to begin the curve was reached. The curve was then drilled to<br>
completion on March 6, 2015 at 11,280' MD, with a projection to bit of 11,024' TVD, and an<br>
inclination of 89.5°. This placed the wellbore approximately 11' below the Lower Bakken<br>
Shale, and near the top of our zone which is set at 11,023' TVD.<br>
The directional and MWD personnel, tools, and official survey and gamma ray data were all<br>
provided by Sperry-Halliburton. This equipment and personnel, combined with collaborated<br>
efforts and communication between QEP and Sunburst, create the ability to accurately place the<br>
wellbore into the target zone. This proves to be especially important when landing a Middle<br>
Bakken well due to the collapsible shale above and below the drilling window.<br>
Geologic Evaluation<br>
A two man geology team provided by Sunburst Consulting Inc. provided the on-site real time<br>
data analysis. Streaming well information is networked through Pason's electronic data recorder<br>
system. This network provides all pertinent data such as depth, drilling rate, total gas, and<br>
gamma ray units throughout the well site, and remotely. The gas data is gathered using Pason's<br>
gas detection and trap system. Total gas is measured using a 10,000 unit scale and logged<br>
without the use of a chromatograph.<br>
Beginning at 6,000' MD while drilling in the Swift Formation, rig crews caught 30' samples at<br>
the direction of the well site geologists. Two sets of dry cuttings are collected and labeled for<br>
both the QEP Energy Company, and the North Dakota Geological Survey. These cuttings were<br>
analyzed in wet and dry conditions under a 20x60 power binocular microscope.<br>
Petrography and Hydrocarbon Shows<br>
No characteristics of hydrocarbon were observed until the lower portion of the Lodgepole<br>
Formation. The first signs of hydrocarbons were recorded in this lower portion of the<br>
Lodgepole. At 10,888' MD the gas steadily began to rise, and peaked at 6,439 units. The<br>
samples indicated fracture porosity and traces of light brown spotty oil stain. The sample<br>
description for this area was argillaceous limestone, medium to dark gray brown wackestone,<br>
finely crystalline, firm, with a crystalline and earthy texture and traces of disseminated pyrite.<br>
The next formation containing significant oil and gas is the Upper Bakken Shale. This top was<br>
recorded at 11,128' MD, 10,991' TVD, (-8,458') SS, only two feet off of the prognosis data. The<br>
<hr>
<A name=9></a>UBS (Figure 2 below,) was composed of black carbonaceous and petroliferous shale, gamma ray<br>
units above 460 API, and a consistent reading of gas, never falling below 1000 units.<br>
Figures 1, 3: Upper Bakken shale (Left), Middle Bakken sandstone (Right).<br>
The Middle Bakken was picked at 11,198' MD, 11,013' TVD, (-8,480') SS. Despite drilling 82'<br>
of measured depth within this formation, a medium to dark brown siltstone and sandstone has<br>
been discovered. These samples contained trace spotty brown oil stain and a relatively elevated<br>
gas signature, having not dropped below 691 units and maintaining 2,010 units as the curve was<br>
landed.<br>
This formation will generally have two distinct facies. The first, a dark brown siltstone observed<br>
at the top, and estimated to be around 3-5' thick, as well as a light to medium brown silty<br>
sandstone making up remainder of the formation (Figure 3.) This rock is fine grained,<br>
moderately well sorted and moderately well calcite cemented. Traces of disseminated pyrite,<br>
intergranular porosity, with a rare brown spotty oil staining were also observed and noted.<br>
Curve Landing &amp; Summary<br>
The QEP operations geologists projected a target zone 10' thick, and 10' below the Upper<br>
Bakken Shale. The Kirkland 6-7-1-12BHD's curve was successfully landed approximately 11'<br>
below the Upper Bakken Shale. The projection to bit shows us at 11,024' TVD, which places us<br>
at the top of our target window as we prepare to drill out for the lateral. This lateral section of<br>
the well is projected to have an initial inclination of 90°. This means the estimated 89.5°<br>
inclination at the bit will put us in great position to begin the lateral. Having an inclination<br>
slightly below dip should allow for the wellbore to descend further into the zone and provide the<br>
data necessary to create a better understanding of the stratigraphic positioning going forward.<br>

Kirkland 6-7-1-12BHD<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
The Kirkland 6-7-1-12BHD is proposed as a double section 10,000' lateral targeting the Middle<br>
Member of the Bakken Formation; however the well bore will intersect three sections. The<br>
vertical and curve will be drilled in section 7, while the lateral portion will be drilled from south<br>
to north within sections 12 and 1. The Kirkland 6-7-1-12BHD will be the first Middle Bakken<br>
lateral drilled and completed on the pad.<br>
ENGINEEERING<br>
Casing was set and cemented from surface to Intermediate Casing Point with 7" HCL80 32#<br>
casing to 11,267' MD. Following casing operations, the drilling fluid was changed from diesel<br>
invert to salt water. The lateral reached TD using a total of two BHA's. The Kirkland 6-7-1-<br>
12BHD lateral was completed on March 14, 2015 at 11:08 CST which reached a total depth of<br>
21,040' MD and 11,036' TVD in 7 drilling days. The bottom hole location is 10,0006.1 N &amp;<br>
436.03 W of surface location or approximately 250.82' FNL &amp; 176.03' FEL, NE NE Sec. 1,<br>
T149N, R95W. Overall the lateral was drilled 98% within the target zone.<br>
TARGET ZONE<br>
The target zone defined by QEP was a 20' target<br>
window measured by 10' below the Upper Bakken<br>
Shale to 10' above the Lower Bakken Shale. The<br>
designated target window spanned two varying<br>
facies the first of which described as the Shoal by<br>
QEP's nomenclature. The Shoal also known as<br>
Packstone consisted of a 3' thick interval of very<br>
hard limestone with abundant ooids, pellets and<br>
ostracod fossil fragments. The second facies<br>
encountered and also the primary target zone rock<br>
consisted of silty sandstone light gray to medium<br>
gray in color, very calcareous and moderately soft<br>
with traces of pyrite.<br>
Figure 1: Light gray to medium gray silty-sandstone<br>
in the lower target window.<br>
Color and pyritic density varied slightly throughout the target zone, the upper portion of target<br>
displayed lighter shades of gray with moderate amounts of tannish colored rocks while the lower<br>
portion (Figure 1) typically darker in color with higher abundance of calcite within the rock.<br>
Color of the rocks helped determine stratigraphic positioning throughout the lateral. Often higher<br>
concentrations of pyrite occurred in the upper portion of target window.<br>
<hr>
<A name=11></a>Background gas consistently increased throughout the lateral when the base of the target zone<br>
was entered. Upon entering the lower quarter of target zone, gas typically increased by 2,000<br>
units where gas shows peaked as high as 3,900 units.<br>
GEOSTEERING<br>
The lateral section of the Kirkland 6-7-1-12BHD was geosteered by the QEP Geology team. Dip<br>
expectations were provided by QEP along with structure maps and nearby offset wells, all of<br>
which suggested an approximate 0.0° regional structural dip. Attempts were made to correlate<br>
repeating gamma signatures for dip calculations. The prominent markers used for steering were<br>
the Ratty Gamma in the middle of target zone and Hard Streak near the bottom. Both markers<br>
were encountered repeatedly during the lateral section providing strong points for geosteering<br>
decisions. The Ratty Gamma signature consists of light gray to medium gray silty sandstone with<br>
moderate to abundant calcite and common pyrite traces. The Hard Streak was a 1' to 2' thick<br>
interval primarily made up of very hard silty lime wackestone, often similar in composition to<br>
the limestone "Shoal" interval at the top of target zone. Initially a 0.0° structural dip was<br>
assumed from surface to bottom hole. Actual dip followed QEP's pre-drill plan closely, only<br>
slight adjustments were made throughout the lateral. The gross overall dip for the Kirkland 6-7-<br>
1-12BHD was 0.03° upward (Figure 2).<br>

<A name=12></a>SUMMARY<br>
The Kirkland 6-7-1-12BHD was the first well on this pad to be completed, and the only Middle<br>
Bakken well.<br>
The pre-drill profile estimation was very close to actual structure, resulting in only slight dip<br>
changes throughout.<br>
The overall gas units as noted were significantly higher near the bottom of target zone.<br>
Throughout the target zone, spotty brown to light green oil staining was present within the rock<br>
cuttings, as well as noticeable oil indications over the shakers. The lateral was drilled from<br>
intermediate casing point to Total Depth in 7 drilling days for a total of 16 drilling days from<br>
spud to finish and reached TD at 21,040' MD on the 14th of March, 2015. Overall the Kirkland<br>
6-7-1-12BHD was drilled approximately 98% within the designated target zone, and shows great<br>
potential for oil production.<br>

Rig crews caught lagged samples in 30' intervals under the supervision of Sunburst geologists. A detailed list of<br>
sampling intervals is included in the well data summary page. Sample or gamma ray marker tops have been inserted<br>
in the sample descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope.<br>
Sample descriptions begin in the Swift Formation. Diesel invert drilling fluid was used for the vertical and curve<br>
while Water based drilling fluid was used for the lateral portions of the well.<br>

HORIZONTAL WELL<br>
KIRKLAND 6-7-1-12BHD<br>
SWSW Section 7-149N-95W<br>
McKenzie County<br>
Well File # 30403<br>
Dear Meghan:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 25324, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, shall be<br>
approximately down the north-south axis (500' drilling corridor, per Commission policy) </span><span class="ft1">and no closer<br>
than the </span><span class="ft3">200' setback </span><span class="ft1">within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of the west half of Sections 6 &amp; 7, T149N<br>
R95W and the east half of Sections 1 &amp; 12, T149N R96W. </span><span class="ft3">*Sections 6 and 7 are within the Grail Field.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must<br>
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are<br>
conducted. Also, due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire<br>
location. Lastly, QEP ENERGY COMPANY must contact NDIC Field Inspector Allen Christensen at<br>
701-989-9183 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing<br>
point is: 10' W. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well<br>
head is: 10056' N, 510' W.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft3">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>
Assistant Director<br>

NOTES ON 9-5/8" SURFACE CASING DESIGN:<br>
The key point in designing surface casing is to extend the shoe of the surface casing beyond the top of<br>
the Pierre Shale. This ensures that all potable or usable water zones are covered. At this point in the well<br>
design, the drilling fluid is changed to oil base mud to contend with salt sections that occur at<br>
approximately 7,000' TVD and 9,400' TVD. The 36 ppf J55 casing accomplishes these criteria easily.<br>
A higher burst rating is not necessary based on industry standards throughout the Williston Basin.<br>
In the event the surface casing burst rating was increased, the normally pressured and sub normally<br>
pressured zones all the way thru the Madison Group at approximately 8,700' TVD has the potential to<br>
break down. Therefore the increased pressure rating of surface casing is not warranted. It is not feasible<br>
to set the surface casing point at a greater depth because the shut in surface pressures would not<br>
appreciably increase. The Dakota formation (5,300' TVD) is frequently weak. Typically, we drill the<br>
intermediate section with 10.5 ppg OBM to the 7" casing point. In the event we lost circulation in the<br>
exposed intermediate interval, the wellbore will not be entirely evacuated and the surface casing can be<br>
shut in without compromising the pressure rating of the 36 ppf J-55.<br>
Calculations for the Surface Casing Design:<br>
3,520 psi/ (6,021 psi (Reservoir Pressure) ­ (11,028 ft x 0.22 psi/ft)) = safety factor of 1.0<br>

Additional Information For Oil Base Mud<br>
A. Oil-base mud will be mixed in the closed circulating system and transferred to 500-bbl tanks on<br>
location for storage prior to and after drilling operations. Drip pans will be installed below the<br>
rotary beams on the substructure and can be viewed on site from the cellar area. As the intermediate<br>
and production section of the hole is drilled, the cuttings transported to the surface with the drilling<br>
fluid will be mechanically separated from the drilling fluid as waste by shale-shakers and then<br>
cleaned/dried via a mud cleaner and/or centrifuge. These separated cuttings will be transferred to a<br>
container, dried and stabilized, and then transported to an approved disposal site or, if a cuttings pit<br>
is approved, the solidified and dried cuttings will be stored in the pit.<br>
B. Plastic material will underlay the rig, oil base mud/diesel storage tanks and mud pits. All tanks on<br>
location will be placed inside of berms. Any oily waste fluids and sediments generated at the work<br>
site during drilling operations or when cleaning the fluid containment system after drilling will also<br>
be stabilized and then transported to an approved disposal site or, if a cuttings pit is approved, it will<br>
be solidified and stored in the cuttings pit.<br>
C. All rig ditches will be lined and directed to a lined sump for fluid recovery. A drip pan will be<br>
installed on the BOP stack, a mud bucket will be utilized as needed on connections and a vacuum<br>
system will be used on the rig floor for fluid recovery in those areas.<br>

D. If a cuttings pit is deemed necessary and acceptable due to unforeseen circumstances and/or<br>
complications with the disposal method described in 10.A above, drill solids and excess cement will<br>
be placed in the cuttings pit and the oilfield waste management consultant Soli-Bond (or a similar<br>
company) will mobilize equipment and personnel to the site to perform the cement based<br>
solidification/stabilization process in-situ for encapsulation with cement kiln dust or flyash prior to<br>
placement in the cuttings pit. Once the drilling operation is complete, the lined cuttings pit will be<br>
reclaimed to grade elevation.<br>

Gas gatherer issues or expansion plans for the area: </span><span class="ft1">Beginning late September, 2014, OKRM has<br>
adequate processing and compression capacity for up to 70 MMcfd of QEP's gas, and low pressure<br>
pipeline capacity for 50-70 MMcfd depending on the location of QEP's wel s. Should QEP's volume<br>
forecast exceed OKRM midstream capacity, QEP wil require another OKRM expansion for compression<br>
and pipelines and has alerted OKRM to begin planning for this possibility for 2015. QEP and OKRM are<br>
parties to a midstream contract that allows for OKRM capacity expansions at QEP's request.<br>

5. QEP flaring amounts:<br>
Statewide percentage of gas flared for existing wells in the Bakken petroleum system: </span><span class="ft1">26% for the most<br>
recent month of November 2014 (18.7 MMcfd flared (adjusted)/72.0 MMcfd production); QEP's gross<br>
flaring of 22.7 MMcfd was adjusted 18.7 MMcfd because QEP estimates it has processed gas at wellhead<br>
NGL skids and/or has 14 day flaring exemptions on new wells of 4.0 MMcfd. [Note: QEP has not<br>
finalized the flaring adjustments for November internally so our flaring percentage may change slightly].<br>
Field wide percentage of gas flared: </span><span class="ft1">37% in the GRAIL field for the most recent month of November<br>
2014 (18.0 MMcfd flared/48.1 MMcfd produced)<br>
6. QEP Alternatives to flaring:<br>
Specific alternative systems available for consideration: </span><span class="ft1">Currently, when OKRM is at capacity or not<br>
connected, QEP has implemented JT NGL conditioning skids for a number of its flaring wells. QEP has<br>
<hr>
<A name=101></a>done this on 3 pads in T149N-R95W and wil continue to set NGL skids on pads which cannot flow. QEP<br>
also is looking at site usage for a number of applications to include powering wellhead equipment,<br>
drilling rigs, gas lift, etc. Further, QEP has installed gas-powered generators on our pads in the<br>
Mandaree field (FBIR) instead of using diesel fuel. QEP and OKRM have time to build adequate<br>
midstream capacity for this particular production pad, but as a last resort QEP may curtail production to<br>
meet NDIC flaring percentage requirements.<br>
Details of flaring reductions if such alternative plans are implemented: </span><span class="ft0">No significant flaring reductions<br>
have been achieved from our implemented or planned alternative systems thus far. However, the JT or<br>
refrigeration NGL skids do reduce our VOCs by 85% where they are installed.<br>

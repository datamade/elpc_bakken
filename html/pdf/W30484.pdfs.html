Dunn County<br>
Well File # 30484<br>
Dear Elizabeth:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24537, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement shall be located<br>
approximately down the north-south axis (</span><span class="ft4">within the 500' drilling corridor </span><span class="ft2">per Commission policy) and no closer<br>
than </span><span class="ft4">200 feet </span><span class="ft2">to the north or south boundary within the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 16, 17, 20, &amp;<br>
21 143N 95W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must<br>
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are<br>
conducted. OXY USA INC must contact NDIC Field Inspector Nicole Nelson at 701-290-1527 prior to<br>
location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing<br>
point is: 442' east. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinates from the<br>
well head are: 10083' north and 942' east.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>

necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft1">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft4">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>

<A name=24></a><hr>
<A name=25></a>Pad<br>
The wells that will be located on the Emil Veverka SESE 20 Pad are shown in the table below.<br>
Pipeline Notification<br>
These wells will be connected to ONEOK's low pressure gathering system in Dunn County,<br>
North Dakota. Oxy's acreage that comprises the spacing unit (SU) for the Emil Veverka 5-20-<br>
17H-143-95 L and Emil Veverka 6-20-17H-143-95 wells is dedicated to ONEOK. Under terms<br>
of the contract, ONEOK is obligated to install the facilities that are required to connect these<br>
wells to its gathering system.<br>
Oxy provides (on a monthly basis) to ONEOK a drilling,<br>
completion and estimated first production date for all wells that are scheduled to be drilled in the<br>
foreseeable future. In addition, Oxy and ONEOK have conference calls, usually bi-weekly, to<br>
discuss connection status of wells and changes to Oxy's drilling and completion schedules.<br>
Gathering System<br>
ONEOK's gathering system in this area is a dynamic system that has multiple compressor<br>
stations with common suction lines. Gas produced from this pad will have a primary flow path<br>
to ONEOK's Lodgepole compressor station and secondary flow paths to ONEOK's Killdeer and<br>
Little Knife compressor stations. The actual flow of the gas will be based on compression<br>
operating parameters and gathering system pressures. Gas gathered on this part of ONEOK's<br>
gathering system is processed at ONEOK's Grassland Processing Plant located in Section 36,<br>
T146N, R105W, McKenzie County, North Dakota.<br>
In addition to ONEOK, Hiland has a low pressure line two miles south of this pad location.<br>
Hiland's lines, along with ONEOK's, are shown on the attached map.<br>
The production facilities for the Emil Veverka 5-20-17H-143-95 L and Emil Veverka 6-20-17H-<br>
143-95 will be located less than 500' from ONEOK's existing 6.625" outside diameter (OD) low<br>
pressure gathering line. The connection to ONEOK will require less than 500' of 4.50" OD low<br>
pressure gathering line and related facilities.<br>
Existing Lines<br>
3<br>
<hr>
<A name=26></a>At the terminus of the metering, associated piping at each well's production facilities and the<br>
500' of 4.50" OD low pressure gathering line noted above, a connection will be made to an<br>
existing 6.625" OD gathering line. This 6.625" OD gathering line extends approximately 2.5<br>
miles before connecting to an 8.625" OD gathering line. This 8.625" OD gathering line traverses<br>
3.5 miles before connecting to a 16" OD gathering line. The 16" OD gathering line extends<br>
approximately 33 miles and then connects to the inlet station piping at ONEOK's Lodgepole<br>
compressor station. This will be the primary flow path of gas delivered to ONEOK from this<br>
pad. As noted under "Gathering System", above, the gas will have secondary flow paths due to<br>
the dynamics of ONEOK's gathering system. The table below shows the capacities and current<br>
flows of the primary gathering lines connecting this well.<br>
ONEOK's low pressure gathering system is near capacity in this area due to continuing<br>
development of the fields in this area. It is projected that the system will have capacity when<br>
these wells are ready for production due to decline on the existing wells gathered on this segment<br>
of the system and ONEOK's continuing efforts to maximize flow on its gathering system(s).<br>
ONEOK is in the process of adding compressors at its Lost Bridge compressor station in Section<br>
14, T147N, R96W, Dunn County and installing a 16" OD low pressure gathering line that will<br>
start in T145N, R94W, Dunn County (Dunn Center) and end at the inlet of the Lost Bridge<br>
compressor station. Construction of these facilities will redirect gas that currently flows on the<br>
primary and secondary flow paths of the Emil Veverka SESE 20 Pad to flow on the new<br>
facilities. Although this does not directly increase the capacity of the primary and secondary<br>
flow paths of the Emil Veverka SESE 20 Pad, it redirects gas that currently flows on the same<br>
pipelines to a different compressor station, in essence reducing volumes transported on the flow<br>
paths for this well. ONEOK is also planning on constructing a new discharge line from its Lost<br>
Bridge compressor station that will deliver some of the gas currently processed at ONEOK's<br>
Grasslands Processing Plant to ONEOK's Garden Creek Processing Plant(s).<br>
ONEOK has announced plans to construct the Bear Creek natural gas processing plant and<br>
related natural gas and natural gas liquids infrastructure in Dunn County, North Dakota. The<br>
Bear Creek natural gas processing plant and related facilities are expected to be operation during<br>
the second quarter of 2016. In addition, ONEOK Demicks Lake natural gas processing plant,<br>
located in McKenzie County, North Dakota, is expected to be operational during the third quarter<br>
of 2016.<br>

<A name=27></a>Flowback Strategy<br>
After the fracture treatments, these wells will be flowed through a choke to test production tanks.<br>
Choke size will depend on final shut in pressure post frac and well pressure prior to opening the<br>
choke. The choke will be adjusted up or down based on flowing pressure, liquid rates and sand<br>
returns, to prevent clogging manifold chokes. During flowback, the water chlorides and sand<br>
content will be monitored. When the water chlorides are greater than 100,000 ppm and the<br>
produced fluids contain no sand, these wells will be turned to production facilities.<br>
The<br>
gathering pipeline and Oxy's production facilities should be constructed before flowback starts<br>
allowing gas sales to start as soon as the well starts flowing through the production facilities,<br>
unless there are capacity issues on ONEOK's system at that time. Based on current information,<br>
it is our belief the system can take this gas upon completion of this well.<br>
Each well on this pad will initially flow 700 barrels of oil and 300 thousand cubic feet of gas per<br>
day based on Oxy's well type curve for this area. This results in an initial production rate of<br>
1,400 barrels oil a day and 600 million cubic feet gas day from the pad. It is anticipated these<br>
wells will decline sharply after initial production as do the majority of horizontal wells in the<br>
Williston Basin.<br>
Current Flaring<br>
The table below shows gas produced, used on lease and sold by Oxy per Gas Production Report -<br>
Form 5B that was filed by Oxy for October 2014 reporting period. The percent sold and percent<br>
flared are also shown in the table.<br>
Flaring Alternative<br>
These wells will be connected to a pipeline prior to production and Oxy does not expect to flare<br>
gas from these wells.<br>
Below are three alternatives that Oxy considered from a conceptual<br>
standpoint to reduce the amount of gas flared. More generally, Oxy is continuing to review the<br>
5<br>
<hr>
<A name=28></a>possible impact of implementing one or more of these alternatives as appropriate in our<br>
operations.<br>
1) NGL Removal ­ On Lease<br>
Captures highest value components in gas stream<br>
Plants are expensive<br>
Uneconomical to operate when volume declines<br>
Residue gas is still flared<br>
2) Power Generation ­ On Lease<br>
Savings if current generation's fuel supply is diesel<br>
Only a portion of gas is consumed operating the generator, remainder of gas will<br>
be flared<br>
Due to gas quality, high NGL content, preference is to purchase power from the<br>
grid and not operate generation on site<br>
3) Compressed Natural Gas ­ On lease<br>
Well site compressors are required to fill CNG trailers<br>
Large capital outlay for equipment and operating cost, includes trucking of<br>
products, are expensive<br>
No gas would be flared, but might be uneconomical to operate when gas volume<br>
declines<br>

Dear Terry:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 21634, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is granted on the<br>
condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' </span><span class="ft1">setback from the north &amp; south boundaries<br>
and </span><span class="ft3">1220' </span><span class="ft1">setback (per Commission policy) from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 25 &amp;<br>
36 T161N R100W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must<br>
be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and<br>
flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. NORTH PLAINS ENERGY, LLC must take into consideration<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned location.<br>
Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) "No boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be placed<br>
nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank." Placement as close as one hundred twenty-five feet [38.10 meters] may<br>
be allowed if a spark or flame arrestor is utilized on the equipment. NORTH PLAINS ENERGY LLC must contact NDIC<br>
Field Inspector Marc Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion<br>
operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and<br>
freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized<br>
representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director<br>
prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The proposed directional<br>
plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 10022'N.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit<br>
on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following<br>
publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn<br>
affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and<br>
any other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit,<br>
the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that notification be given<br>
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The<br>
following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and<br>
time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-<br>
8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a certified copy<br>
of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a<br>
form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the<br>
survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one<br>
adobe document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90<br>
feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement<br>
utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones<br>
can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the<br>
presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production<br>
or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as<br>
one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a<br>
standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>

Importance:<br>
High<br>
Alice,<br>
 <br>
As requested, please see attached "revised" Gas Capture Plan for NPE's State 161-100-36-25-15D-<br>
1H which addresses Items 5a &amp; 5b in the last few paragraphs on Page 5 of the document.<br>
 <br>
Hopefully, this is satisfactory and the review/approval process can move forward as NPE is anxious<br>
 to receive this "approved" APD in order to adhere to their current drilling schedule.<br>
 <br>
If you need additional information or have any questions/concerns, please do not hesitate to contact<br>
 me.<br>
 <br>
Thanks so much, as always, for your assistance; it is certainly appreciated by NPE and RMP!<br>
Kalen<br>

 <br>
Good afternoon Kalen,<br>
 <br>
Nathaniel &amp; I reviewed the Gas Capture Plan (GCP) for this well and they are missing a response to<br>
 Item 5a &amp; 5B from the requirements (see attached letter &amp; sample).  Please have them review this<br>
 and revise the GCP.<br>
 <br>
If there are any questions they can contact Nathaniel Erbele at 701-328-8020.<br>
 <br>
Thanks,<br>
Alice<br>

STATE 161100362515D1H <br>
ALEXANDRIA FIELD <br>
Divide County, ND<br>
 <br>
 <br>
OneOk Rockies Midstream, LLC (ORM) will gather and process North Plains Energy's (NPE) State 161100<br>
362515D1H gas production from the Alexandria Field.  Gas will be gathered into their Crosby (Divide) and <br>
Alamo (Divide/Williams) systems and processed at ORM's Stateline Plant in Williams County, S21T155N<br>
103W.  ORM installed lowpressure gas gathering lines in the east half of Alexandria Field (trending east<br>
west, map attached) to process gas from Baytex USA operated wells.  No other midstream gas gathering <br>
lines exist in the immediate area.  ROW acquisition is in progress by both ORM and NPE for the State 36/25 <br>
well.  Tiein will either be at the north section line of S25161100 (Baytex Lateral 6) or at the south section <br>
line of S12160100 (Baytex Lateral 4).  ORM projects the tiein of NPE's State 36/25 gas into their system <br>
upon commencement of production, anticipated to be Nov14 based on NPE's current drilling schedule. <br>
 <br>
ORM's  gas  plant  and  compressor  station  design  capacities  and  current  throughput  volumes  as  of  June  1, <br>
2014 are described below.  At the time NPE State 36/25 will be put on production, ORM's Crosby Station <br>
will handle 20 MMcfd with spare capacity.  Their Crosby gathering system is projected to handle 100% of <br>
the  well's  projected  375  Mcfd  peak  production,  as  well  as  gas  production  from  2  NPE  Smoky  Butte  Field <br>
wells on the common pad State 36/25 will be located. <br>

NPE  plans  to  drill  the  State  36/25  well  in  late  Aug/Sep2014  and  complete  in  Fall  2014.   Flowback  will <br>
commence during lateral cleanout, and the well will be put on ESP after cleanout operations are completed.  <br>
Projected date of first production is 11/1/2014, with anticipated average IP90 rates of 400 BOPD and 325 <br>
Mcfd.  NPE utilizes wellhead gas for electric power generation for artificial lift and SWD pump operations.  <br>
NPE projects electrification of the State 36/25 site in the 201516 timeframe.  Gasfired generation will be <br>
used until BurkeDivide Coop power becomes available.    <br>
     <br>
     <br>
NPE  currently  utilizes  20%  of  its  produced  gas  in  North  Dakota  for  electric  power  generation  for  the  6 <br>
producing wells and 3 SWD wells it operates.  NPE presently flares in total approximately 80% (~750 Mcfd) <br>
of its gas production on a statewide basis.  This flare % ratio is projected to decline to &lt;20% by 1/1/2015 <br>
with ORM's gas gathering installation in the T160/161R100 area in the 2</span><span class="ft11">nd</span><span class="ft8"> half of 2014   NPE currently does <br>
not operate any wells in the Alexandria Field, so presently NPE flares no gas in the field (0% rate).  The State <br>
36/25 well when completed will be tied into ORM's sales line upon commencement of production, so no <br>
gas flaring alternatives are required.  <br>

HORIZONTAL WELL<br>
HEEN 26-35 #6TFH<br>
NENW Section 26-155N-101W<br>
Williams County<br>
Well File # 29229<br>
Dear Michelle:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 21978, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is granted on<br>
the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' </span><span class="ft1">setback from the north &amp; south<br>
boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' </span><span class="ft1">setback from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 26 &amp; 35 T155N<br>
R101W. </span><span class="ft3">Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to the fact that this well is located within a municipality an onsite inspection is required.<br>
Contact NDIC Field Inspector for site specific stipulations to include but not limited to: Closed Mud System, no drilling pit, an<br>
impermeable liner as required on the entire location, H2S contingency plan, location fenced, perimeter dike around entire<br>
location, a string of casing must be placed in the rat and mouse hole and cemented to ground level. All distances on the<br>
Production Layout Plat must comply with NDAC 43-02-03-28 (SAFETY REGULATIONS). Effective June 1, 2014, a covered<br>
leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud,<br>
and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. In cases<br>
where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be provided affirming that the surface owner of the<br>
multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property of the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite<br>
spacing/drilling unit. STATOIL OIL &amp; GAS must contact NDIC Field Inspector Jessica Gilkey at 701-770-7340 prior to<br>
location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion<br>
operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and<br>
freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized<br>
representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director<br>
prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The proposed directional<br>
plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 9920'S and<br>
1185'W.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit<br>
on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following<br>
publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn<br>
affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and<br>
any other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit,<br>
the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given immediately upon the<br>
spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information<br>
must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.<br>
Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a certified<br>
copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or<br>
in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the<br>
survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one<br>
adobe document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90<br>
feet in the lateral.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is hereby granted. Such<br>
information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing on the date the well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well records wherever located.<br>
Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall permit the Director and his representatives to come<br>
upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and<br>
operation of such wells and to have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect<br>
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time upon request. The<br>
information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and shall be available only to the Commission and<br>
its staff.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement<br>
utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones<br>
can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the<br>
presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production<br>
or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as<br>
one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a<br>
standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov </span><span class="ft0">Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

DRILLING PROGNOSIS<br>
1.<br>
Pressure Control Equipment<br>
Blowout preventer (BOP) and related equipment (BOPE) shall be installed, used,<br>
maintained and tested in manner necessary to assure well control. The BOP and<br>
related control equipment shall be suitable for operations in those areas which are<br>
subject to subfreezing conditions. The BOPE shall be based on known or anticipated<br>
sub-surface pressures, geologic conditions, accepted engineering practice and surface<br>
environment. The working pressure of all BOPE shall exceed the anticipated surface<br>
pressure to which it may be subjected, assuming a partially evacuated hole with a<br>
pressure gradient of 0.22 psi/ft. A well control device shall be installed at the surface<br>
that is capable of complete closure of the wellbore. This device shall be closed<br>
whenever the well is unattended. If repair or replacement of the BOPE is required<br>
after testing, this work shall be performed prior to drilling out the casing shoe. When<br>
the BOPE cannot function to secure the hole, the hole shall be secured using cement,<br>
retrievable packer, bridge plug packer, bridge plug, or other acceptable approved<br>
method to assure safe well conditions. A schematic of the proposed pressure control<br>
equipment is attached.<br>
a. Type: Eleven (11) inch double gate hydraulic BOP with eleven (11) inch annular<br>
preventer. The blow-out preventer will be equipped as follows:<br>
i. Annular preventer.<br>
ii. Pipe ram, blind ram (another pipe ram if warranted for use with a<br>
tapered drill string).<br>
iii. Drilling spool with two (2) side outlets (choke side shall be a 3-<br>
inch minimum, kill side shall be at least 2-inch diameter).<br>
iv. 3 inch diameter choke line.<br>
v. 2 choke line valves (3 inch minimum).<br>
vi. Kill line (2 inch minimum).<br>
vii. 2 chokes with 1 remotely controlled from rig floor (diagram<br>
attached).<br>
viii. 2 kill line valves and a check valve (2 inch minimum).<br>
ix. Upper kelly cock valve with handle available.<br>
x. When the expected pressures approach working pressure of the<br>
system, 1 remote kill line tested to stack pressure (which shall run<br>
to the outer edge of the substructure and be unobstructed).<br>
xi. Lower kelly cock valve with handle available.<br>
<hr>
<A name=78></a>xii. Safety valve &amp; subs to fit all drill string connections in use.<br>
xiii. Inside BOP or float sub available.<br>
xiv. Pressure gauge on choke manifold.<br>
xv. All BOPE connections subjected to well pressure shall be flanged,<br>
welded or clamped.<br>
xvi. Fill-up line above the uppermost preventer.<br>
b. Anticipated Bottom Hole Pressure: 5,500 psi<br>
c. Anticipated Bottom Hole Temperature: 240º Fahrenheit<br>
d. Testing Procedure:<br>
Annular Preventer<br>
At a minimum, the Annular Preventer will be pressure tested to 50% of the rated<br>
working pressure for a period of ten (10) minutes or until provisions of the test are<br>
met, whichever is longer. At a minimum, the above pressure test will be<br>
performed:<br>
1. When the annular preventer is initially installed;<br>
2. Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken;<br>
3. Following related repairs; and<br>
4. At thirty (30) day intervals.<br>
In addition, the annular preventer will be functionally operated at least weekly.<br>
Blow-Out Preventer<br>
At a minimum, the BOP, choke manifold, and related equipment will be pressure<br>
tested to the approved working pressure of the BOP stack (if isolated from the<br>
surface casing by a test plug) or to 70% of the internal yield strength of the<br>
surface casing (if the BOP is not isolated from the surface casing by a test plug).<br>
Pressure will be maintained for a period of at least ten (10) minutes or until the<br>
requirements of the test are met, whichever is longer. At a minimum, the above<br>
pressure test will be performed:<br>
1. When the BOP is initially installed;<br>
2. Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken;<br>
3. Following related repairs; and<br>
4. At thirty (30) day intervals.<br>
In addition, the pipe and blind rams will be activated each trip, but not more than<br>
once each day. All BOP drills and tests will be recorded in the IADC driller's<br>
log.<br>
e. Choke Manifold Equipment:<br>
All choke lines will be straight lines unless turns use tee blocks or are targeted with<br>
running tees, and will be anchored to prevent whip and vibration. All valves (except<br>
chokes) in the kill line choke manifold and choke line shall be a type that does not<br>
restrict the flow (full opening) and that allows a straight through flow. Pressure<br>
gauges in the well control system shall be a type designed for drilling fluid service.<br>
<hr>
<A name=79></a>f.<br>
Accumulator:<br>
The accumulator will have sufficient capacity to open the hydraulically-controlled<br>
choke line valve (if so equipped), close all rams plus the annular preventer, and retain a<br>
minimum of 200 psi above pre-charge on the closing manifold without the use of the<br>
closing unit pumps. The fluid reservoir capacity will be double the usable fluid volume<br>
of the accumulator system capacity and the fluid level of the reservoir will be<br>
maintained at the manufacturer's recommendations.<br>
The BOP system will have two (2) independent power sources to close the preventers.<br>
Nitrogen bottles (3 minimum) will be one of these independent power sources and<br>
will maintain a charge equal to the manufacturer's specifications. The accumulator<br>
pre-charge pressure test will be conducted prior to connecting the closing unit to the<br>
BOP stack and at least once every six (6) months thereafter. The accumulator<br>
pressure will be corrected if the measured pre-charge pressure is found to be above or<br>
below the maximum or minimum limits.<br>
A manual locking device (i.e., hand wheels) or automatic locking device will be<br>
installed on all systems of 2M or greater. A valve will be installed in the closing line<br>
as close as possible to the annular preventer to act as a locking device. This valve<br>
will be maintained in the open position and will be closed only when the power<br>
source for the accumulator system is inoperative.<br>
Remote controls shall be readily accessible to the driller. Remote controls for all 3M<br>
or greater systems will be capable of closing all preventers. Remote controls for 5M<br>
or greater systems will be capable of both opening and closing all preventers. Master<br>
controls will be at the accumulator and will be capable of opening and closing all<br>
preventers and choke line valve (if so equipped).<br>
g. Miscellaneous Information:<br>
The choke manifold and BOP extension rods with hand wheels will be located<br>
outside the rig sub-structure. The hydraulic BOP closing unit will be located at least<br>
twenty-five (25) feet from the well head but readily accessible to the driller. Exact<br>
locations and configurations of the hydraulic BOP closing unit will depend upon the<br>
particular rig contracted to drill this hole. A flare line will be installed after the choke<br>
manifold extending 125 feet (minimum) form the center of the drill hole to a separate<br>
flare pit.<br>

Proposed Casing and Cementing Program<br>
Statoil Oil &amp; Gas LP (Statoil) proposes to drill a vertical hole in NE¼ NW¼ (430' FNL<br>
&amp; 1685' FWL) of Section 26 in Township 155 North, Range 101 West to an approximate<br>
TVD of 10212' at which time directional drilling operations will be initiated on an<br>
azimuth direction of 220.9º until a 90º angle has been achieved at a TVD of 10685' (MD<br>
approximately 10962'). Statoil will then commence with the drilling of a 9677' (+/-)<br>
lateral horizontal reach in the Three Forks formation on a build rate of 2º/100' until the<br>
azimuth direction has reached 180º. Statoil will continue to drill in the lateral until a<br>
<hr>
<A name=80></a>measured depth of approximately 20639' (TVD approximately 10694') has been reached<br>
at a target bottom hole footage of approximately 250' FSL and 540' FWL (SW¼ SW¼<br>
of Section 35, Township 155 North, Range 101 West. At total depth, the bottom hole<br>
will be located approximately 9868' south and 1142' west of the surface hole location.<br>

The surface casing will have centralizers on the bottom three (3) joints with a minimum<br>
of one (1) centralizer per joint starting with the shoe joint. The estimated top of cement<br>
for the intermediate casing string will be set at approximately 3,800' MD. Statoil will<br>
install one (1) solid centralizer or stand-off band every other joint thru the curve and<br>
one (1) per joint thru the first salt formation top that is encountered in the vertical<br>
portion of the wellbore to centralize the intermediate casing string.<br>

Horizontal Production Liner - The lateral liner will be uncemented.<br>
Please refer to the casing program attached within drilling plan for additional specifics<br>
regarding cement yields and additional additives. The above cement volumes are<br>
approximate and were calculated under the assumption that a gauge hole will be<br>
achieved. Actual cement volumes may vary due to variations in the actual hole gauge<br>
and will be determined by running a caliper log on the drilled hole. All waiting on cement<br>
(WOC) times will be adequate to achieve a minimum of 500 psi compressive strength at<br>
the casing shoe prior to drilling out.<br>

<A name=83></a>Surface Casing<br>
Burst Design: The surface casing is designed to withstand having the casing exposed full evacuation<br>
while drilling the 8 ¾" hole due to a kick; with a fracture gradient of 16.0ppg (verified through LOT), and<br>
no support by cement. At 2,200ft TVD the expected surface pressure is 1,830psi, the burst of the surface<br>
casing is 3,950psi. Therefore ADF = 2.158. During a 2000psi pressure test the casing is withstanding<br>
50.6% of its burst pressure yielding a burst ADF = 1.975.<br>
Collapse Design: The surface casing is designed to withstand full evacuation of the 8 ¾" hole with no<br>
support from cement. The shoe will break at 1,830psi (16ppg) yielding an ADF = 1.404.<br>
Tensile Design: The surface casing is designed to withstand 100,000lb over-pull while being run in<br>
8.33lb/gal freshwater. The buoyed weight with 100,000lb over-pull is 176,808lb yielding an ADF =<br>
2.545.<br>
Intermediate Casing<br>
Burst Design: Burst for the 7" intermediate casing is calculated twice, once for drilling operations, and<br>
again for completions operations. In the drilling phase the casing is designed to withstand being fully<br>
exposed to reservoir pressure (10.2ppg) while being fully evacuated to gas at 0.1psi/ft as the shoe is set<br>
inside the reservoir. This gives maximum expected pressure of 4,519psi at surface. With no external<br>
support the casing the minimum ADF = 2.755 for the 32lb/ft casing for drilling operations. During<br>
completions phase the 7" casing is exposed to a maximum casing test pressure of 9,000psi. For<br>
completions operations the minimum ADF = 1.383.<br>
Collapse Design: The 7" intermediate casing is designed to contain plastic deformation of salt formations<br>
in the last 1,500ft of the vertical hole. Overburden is assumed to be 1.0psi/ft TVD. Areas where the<br>
35lb/ft casing is run this formation goes to 9,750ft TVD, and in all other areas where the 32lb/ft is run this<br>
salt formation goes to 9,000ft TVD. Therefore the design factors for the 35lb/ft and 32lb/ft casings are<br>
ADF = 1.198 and 1.336 respectively.<br>
Tensile Design: The intermediate casing is designed to withstand 100,000lb over-pull while being run in<br>
9.8ppg mud. The buoyed weight of 11,000ft (10,500ft TVD) of 32lb/ft casing with 100,000lb over-pull is<br>
399,334lb yielding a minimum of ADF = 2.243.<br>
Production Liner<br>
Burst Design: The 11.6 and 13.5 lb/ft liner is designed to operate below 80% burst rating during the<br>
completions phase pressure test of 9,000psi. The 11.6 is run in the Bakken laterals and is specifically<br>
ordered to have a minimum yield strength of 125ksi in the P-110 grade and the 13.5 is run in the Three<br>
Forks laterals. At 9,000psi the 11.6 is operating at 74% of Burst or ADF = 1.35 and the 13.5 is operating<br>
at 72% of Burst or ADF = 1.38.<br>
<hr>
<A name=84></a>Collapse Design: Both liner weights are designed to sustan full evacuation while being exposed to a<br>
wellbore with 3,000ft TVD of 11.7lb/gal CaCl and 7,500ft of 10.2lb/gal saltwater, yielding a net pressure<br>
of 5,803psi. Under these conditions the 11.6 ADF = 1.526 and the 13.5 ADF = 1.842.<br>
Tensile Design: Both liner weights are designed to withstand 100,000lb of over-pull while being run in<br>
9.6lb/gal saltwater. The buoyed weitght of 11,000ft of 11.6 liner with 100,000lb over-pull is 208,898lb<br>
yielding ADF = 2.011; and the 13.5 ADF = 1.861.<br>
Centralization &amp; Cementing Program<br>
Surface Casing: The surface casing will have three centralizers on the bottom three joints, then one every<br>
three joints back to surface. Cement top will be at surface and topped-off if the cement should drop.<br>
Surface cement is approx. 367sx of lead cement at 11.5ppg and 2.9ft</span><span class="ft4">3 </span><span class="ft1">/sx, and 284sx of tail cement at<br>
15.8ppg and 1.16 ft</span><span class="ft4">3 </span><span class="ft1">/sx.<br>
Intermediate Casing: Intermediate casing will have one stand-off band every joint through the curve,<br>
then one centralizer every three joints into the salts, then one every joint 100ft+/- the salt formations, then<br>
one every joint to 1,500ft below the surface shoe. The cement top is designed to be 1,500ft below the<br>
surface shoe. Pipe rotation and reciprocation during cement displacement is standard practice.<br>
Intermediate cement is approx. 284sx of cement at 11.8ppg and 2.21 ft</span><span class="ft4">3 </span><span class="ft1">/sx; 527sx of cement at 15.8ppg<br>
and 1.54 ft</span><span class="ft4">3 </span><span class="ft1">/sx. Tail cement is designed to cover the salt formations.<br>
Production Casing: Currently (1Q2014) standard practice is un-cemented liner with swell packers.<br>
However we are moving to cemented liners. A cemented liner will have one solid body 5.75"OD<br>
centralizer per joint throughout the lateral. Cement will be a 15.8ppg circulated to the liner top. Pipe<br>
rotation will be standard practice.<br>

&amp;<br>
Heen 26-35 Unit<br>
Statoil Oil &amp; Gas LP ("Statoil") hereby submits the gas capture plan (the "Plan") in<br>
connection with its Application for Permit to Drill the Bakken and Three Forks formations<br>
covered by the Smith Farm 23-14 &amp; Heen 26-35 units (the "Units"). The Plan is based on a<br>
multi-well startup that includes an eight-well drillout program, three days at initial production<br>
with one day allocated for rig up/down per well. The Plan fulfills the requirements set forth in<br>
the letter dated May 8, 2014 from Todd Holweger, DMR Permit Manager, to Bakken Operators,<br>
a copy of which is hereby attached as Exhibit A. The item numbers below refer to Mr.<br>
Holweger's letter.<br>
Item 1. Attached as Exhibit B is an affidavit from a company representative indicating<br>
the name of the gas gatherer Statoil met with and confirming that Statoil supplied the gas gatherer<br>
with the anticipated completion date of the wells and the anticipated production rates of the wells.<br>
Item 2. Attached as Exhibit C are detailed maps depicting (a) the name and location of<br>
the destination processing plant, (b) the name of the gas gatherer and location of lines for each gas<br>
gatherer in the map vicinity and (c) the proposed route and tie-in point to connect the subject well<br>
to an existing gas line.<br>
Item 3. Information on the existing line, to which Statoil proposes to connect, is as<br>
follows:<br>
(a) The maximum current daily capacity of the existing gas line is approximately 5.4<br>
MMCFD with the Stateline compressor's maximum daily capacity of 30 MMCFD.<br>
(b) The current throughput of the existing gas line is approximately 2.2 MMCFD with the<br>
Stateline compressor's current throughput at approximately 20 MMCFD.<br>
(c) The anticipated daily capacity of existing gas line at date of first gas sales is 12 MMCFD,<br>
assuming 16" line loop.<br>
(d) The anticipated throughput of existing gas line at date of first gas sales is approximately<br>
5.8 MMCFD.<br>
(e) ONEOK has management approval for the 16" line loop and is currently acquiring<br>
Right of Way.<br>
The foregoing information was provided to Statoil by ONEOK, the proposed gas gatherer for the<br>
Unit. Statoil has relied on and is incapable of independently verifying such information. It is<br>
Statoil's understanding that capacity and throughput amounts listed above could change at any<br>
<hr>
<A name=116></a>time. The anticipated daily capacity and anticipated throughput at date of first gas sales are<br>
therefore a reasonable estimate based on information provided by ONEOK.<br>
Item 4. Statoil's flowback strategy for the Unit is the following:<br>
(a) The anticipated date of first production is anticipated to occur between April 1, 2015 and<br>
June 30, 2015.<br>
(b) The anticipated initial production rate is estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000 MCFD<br>
per well, with a duration of between 30 and 40 days for all eight wells planned for the<br>
Units. After flowback, all eight wells will be brought on production with an anticipated<br>
maximum rate of production between 3,000 and 4,000 MCFD.<br>
Item 5. Statoil is currently flaring the following amounts of gas:<br>
(a) Statoil's statewide percentage of gas flared for existing wells producing from the Bakken<br>
petroleum system is 33%.<br>
(b) Statoil's Cow Creek fieldwide percentage of gas flared is 74%.<br>
Statoil's Todd fieldwide percentage of gas flared is 45%.<br>
Item 6. Statoil will evaluate the following considerations for alternatives to flaring:<br>
(a) Install a JT Skid to process gas at the lease for an estimated 30% to 40% flared<br>
volume reduction.<br>
(b) Develop a high pressure gathering system in the area for an estimated 85% flared<br>
volume reduction.<br>
(c) Install a CNG Unit to capture natural gas, compress and distribute to field as clean<br>
Fuel for an estimated 1MMCFD to 1.5 MMCFD flared volume reduction.<br>
(d) Curtail production according to the guidelines listed in Order No. 24665.<br>

 <br>
RE:    GAS CAPTURE PLANS REQUIRED ON ALL APD'S <br>
  <br>
Dear Operator: <br>
This  letter  is  to  facilitate  understanding  by  operators  that  all  Applications  for  a  Permit  to  Drill  (APD) <br>
submitted to the NDIC Oil &amp; Gas Division, received after May 31, 2014, must be accompanied by a Gas <br>
Capture Plan (GCP).   The plan is part of the North Dakota Industrial Commission's newlyadopted policy <br>
on reducing gas flaring.   This requirement is for all wells which will be drilled to the Bakken, Three Forks, <br>
Three Forks/Bakken or Sanish Pools.   The GCP must accompany all APD permit renewals.    <br>
The gas capture plan must contain the following information: <br>
1. An affidavit signed by a company representative indicating: <br>
a. The name of the gas gatherer(s) the company met with. <br>
b. That the company supplied the gas gatherer(s) with the following information: <br>
i. Anticipated completion date of well(s). <br>
ii. Anticipated production rates of well(s). <br>
2. A detailed gas gathering pipeline system location map which depicts the following information.   <br>
a. Name and location of the destination processing plant. <br>
b. Name of gas gatherer and location of lines for each gas gatherer in the map vicinity. <br>
c. The proposed route and tiein point to connect the subject well to an existing gas line. <br>
3. Information on the existing line, to which operator proposes to connect to, including: <br>
a. Maximum current daily capacity of the existing gas line. <br>
b. Current throughput of the existing gas line. <br>
c. Anticipated daily capacity of existing gas line at date of first gas sales. <br>
d. Anticipated throughput of existing gas line at date of first gas sales. <br>
e. Gas gatherer issues or expansion plans for the area (if known). <br>
4. A detailed flowback strategy including: <br>
a. Anticipated date of first production. <br>
b. Anticipated oil and gas rates and duration.  If well is on a multiwell pad, include total <br>
for all wells being completed. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<hr>
<A name=119></a>5. Amount of gas applicant is currently flaring:  <br>
a. Statewide percentage of gas flared (total gas flared/total gas produced) for existing <br>
wells producing from the Bakken petroleum system.  Note industry target goals are to <br>
reduce flaring to 26% by 9114, 23% by 1115, 15% by 1116, and 10% by 9120. <br>
b. Fieldwide percentage of gas flared. <br>
6. Alternatives to flaring. <br>
a. Explain specific alternate systems available for consideration. <br>
b. Detail expected flaring reductions if such plans are implemented. <br>
 <br>
Permit consideration may be delayed or stipulations may be imposed (such as production restrictions) if <br>
applicant is unable to timely connect the subject well and alternatives to reduce the amount of flared <br>
gas will not be implemented. <br>
The NDIC believes a concerted effort by operators in North Dakota is necessary to reduce the volume of <br>
flared  gas,  reduce  the  number  of  wells  flaring,  and  reduce  duration  of  flaring  of  wells,  which  will <br>
ultimately meet our goal to encourage and promote the development, production, and utilization of oil <br>
and  gas  in  the  state  in  such  a  manner  as  will  prevent  waste,  maximize  economic  recovery,  and  fully <br>
protect  the  correlative  rights  of  all  owners  to  the  end  that  the  landowners,  the  royalty  owners,  the <br>
producers, and the general public realize the greatest possible good from these vital natural resources. <br>
 Should you require additional information, feel free to contact our office. <br>
Sincerely, <br>
Todd L. Holweger <br>

Well Site Description<br>
The Statoil Oil and Gas, L.P. (Statoil) Heen / Smith Farm Multi-well site will be a production<br>
site for crude oil and gas. There are 8 wells scheduled to be drilled at this location. Crude oil<br>
will be pumped from the wells to bulk storage tanks on site and subsequently transferred off<br>
location by pipeline or truck. The site operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The site will have<br>
thirty to thirty-two 400 bbl tanks for salt water and oil storage. The facility is surrounded by a<br>
containment berm underlain by compacted fill which contains liquids from leaving the site and<br>
keeps liquids from offsite from entering the location. The attached production layout diagram<br>
shows the final layout of the facility once completed. Erosion controls will be installed to deter<br>
any erosion of the berm.<br>
Initially drilling and completion activities will be performed to install and prepare the wells for<br>
production. During this phase the site will have controlled access and safety systems will be in<br>
place to prevent emergency situations such as blow outs, uncontrolled releases of gases and<br>
liquids. Additionally, fire prevention steps will be taken to assure safe operations. Table 1<br>
presents the well site and location information.<br>

<A name=129></a>Section 2: Emergency Notification and Response Personnel Phone List<br>
In general, an "emergency" is defined as any unexpected occurrence either resulting in, or having<br>
the likely potential to result in death, serious injury (or illness) requiring hospitalization and / or<br>
an environmental impact posing a serious threat to on-scene personnel, wildlife, or major and<br>
significant damage to Operator or Contractor property or reputation.<br>
The response to such<br>
incidents requires immediate notification and action. The Emergency Notification Phone List<br>
provided below identifies and prioritizes the names and phone numbers of the organizations and<br>
personnel that need to be notified immediately in the event of an emergency. This contact list<br>
should be placed in a location that is accessible to all employees to ensure that, in case of an<br>

Section 3:<br>
Emergency Plans<br>
In the event of an emergency during drilling and completion activities, site personnel have<br>
specific protocols and procedures to address situations. A Blow Out Prevention Plan (BOPP)<br>
and a Spill Prevention and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC) will be in place during these initial<br>
activities.<br>
The plans detail the preventative and response actions associated with the well<br>
installation and preparation activities.<br>
Once the location enters the production stage a Federal SPCC plan will be in place to address<br>
spill and liquid releases. Other emergency situations will be handled on a case by case basis<br>
using the Statoil Emergency Response Plan for the Bakken Business Unit. The plan details the<br>
response matrix for a variety of emergencies including inclimate weather or vandalism.<br>
Section 4:<br>
Emergency Response Equipment and Contractors<br>
Statoil Oil and Gas owns and maintains a variety of emergency response equipment and has<br>
several contractors on retainer in the event of an emergency response. Statoil personnel will<br>
provide response to small discharges. Statoil personnel and, if needed, Earthmovers, Key Energy<br>

Well Site Emergency Response Plan ­ Page 5<br>
<hr>
<A name=131></a>Services, Deer Valley Trucking, Power Fuels, or ES&amp;H will be contacted for medium and<br>
large/worst-case discharges. In the case of a worst case scenario Statoil and the Earthmovers Full<br>
Level A Response Team may be contacted.<br>
The site selection for an incident command<br>
(mitigation) center should be chosen by the responder from Statoil ­ Well Site. The incident<br>
command center will likely be based at the Statoil office in Williston, ND.<br>
Section 5:<br>
Immediate Actions - Initial Response Actions<br>
The following actions must be taken if it is safe to accomplish. These actions are prioritized<br>
based on one person being on-site to ensure a person's safety. If more than one person is on-site,<br>
then the following actions can be assigned to a specific person to reduce the time required to<br>
isolate the discharge, make immediate notifications, and initiate control actions. When there are<br>
several persons on-site, the senior person is responsible for ensuring these actions are safely<br>
accomplished.<br>
1. Identify the nature of the emergency. Take immediate actions necessary to preserve life<br>
if safe to do. Operations level should stop the product flow at the closest valve and/or<br>
shut down pumps, if it can be accomplished safely</span><span class="ft4">.<br>
2. Warn personnel within the immediate area. Operations level will have nonessential<br>
personnel evacuate to the area upgradient and upwind and report to the meeting place<br>
outside the property. If there are transport vehicles in the loading rack or waiting to<br>
load, have the drivers remove their vehicles to a safe location outside the site, if it is<br>
safe to move the vehicles.<br>
Prevent any vehicles (other than response team) from<br>
entering the area.<br>
3. Make appropriate notification to the Statoil Well Site operators and Site Manager. Notify<br>
Statoil 24-Hour line at (512) 427-3300 (24/7). Senior person directing activities may call<br>
911 for site perimeter control, personnel rescue, and/or fire assistance.<br>
4. Notify nearby locations that could be impacted.<br>
Note:<br>
Once the Well Site Manager or designate (IC) arrives at the site, the senior person<br>
directing the initial activities will brief the senior responder on the current situation and actions<br>
taken. The IC will coordinate all further activities<br>
Section 6:<br>
Plan Review, Update and Distribution<br>
The Bakken BU Operations Emergency Response Coordinator is responsible for preparing and<br>
updating this ERP. The plan will be reviewed and updated (where applicable) annually, or<br>
whenever necessary to reflect changes in organization, operations, procedures, or contact<br>
information.<br>
This ERP will be communicated and available to those personnel that may be called upon to<br>
provide assistance during a response</span><span class="ft4">.<br>

All releases of material which potentially could or will adversely impact residents beyond the<br>
confines of the operational site must be reported immediately to the designated Emergency<br>
Operations Center.<br>
In North Dakota, each county has set up and operates an Emergency<br>
Operations Center. This notification will be made for all confirmed releases of hydrogen sulfide<br>
at or above 1000 ppm or at or above 10 ppm for more than one hour.<br>

All releases of material at or above its reportable quantity (RQ) must be reported to the US Coast<br>
Guards National Response Center. The RQ for Hydrogen Sulfide is 100 lbs. or approximately<br>
the volume from an unrestrained release from the wellhead for a period of one minute if the plant<br>
is operating at maximum throughput. Even if the injection well check valve holds, the line fill<br>
from the compressor to the check valve contains approximately 314 lbs of H</span><span class="ft4">2</span><span class="ft1">S which is a<br>
reportable event.<br>
The Reportable Quantity for Sulfur Dioxide is 500 lbs. Even the line fill<br>
volume, if released while being combusted, would qualify as a reportable event of 590 lbs.<br>

Plan Introduction<br>
This Hydrogen Sulfide (H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S) Mitigation Plan is intended to outline pro-active steps taken to<br>
minimize impacts from accidental release of H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S gas or sulfur dioxide (SO</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">) which could occur<br>
from Statoil operated facilities or equipment.<br>
Predetermined response actions and<br>
countermeasures as well as preparations for both Statoil employees and area emergency response<br>
personnel are also included. The protection of area residents, Statoil employees and the general<br>
public are paramount in developing this plan of action.<br>
American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice 55 (API RP 55) and Bureau of Land<br>
Management (BLM) Onshore Oil &amp; Gas Order 6 provides guidance in recognizing, preparing,<br>
and mitigating potentially dangerous releases of H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S. Not all situations can be foreseen at or<br>
near the area of the facility, nor can detailed instructions be provided for every situation that<br>
might be encountered. The policies and guidelines set forth in this document should be<br>
considered as a minimum set of requirements for preparing and dealing with H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S exposure.<br>

General Information<br>
Traditional risk management activities strive to protect the assets and profits of an organization<br>
by reducing the potential for loss before it occurs, and by financing, through insurance and other<br>
means, potential risks to catastrophic loss, such as natural disasters, human error or court<br>
judgments.<br>
However, in the situation where the hazard is inherent in the operation of the<br>
company's asset, the focus shifts to protection of employees, neighbors, the surrounding<br>
communities and their assets.<br>
Risk management is a discipline which the risk management process consists of four basic<br>
elements:<br>
Risk Assessment - identifying and quantifying the exposures that threaten an<br>
organization's assets and profitability<br>
Loss Control - reducing the frequency and/or severity of losses through<br>
preventive measures, such as sprinkler systems, improved housekeeping practices<br>
or preventive maintenance of key equipment<br>
Risk Transfer - shifting the financial burden of loss so that, in the event of a<br>
catastrophe, an organization can continue to function without severe hardship to<br>
its financial stability<br>
Risk Monitoring - continually assessing existing and potential exposure<br>
3.1<br>
Facility Description<br>
Statoil's drill site Smith Farm / Heen Multi-Well Pad is located in Williams County, North<br>
Dakota (ND). The drill site is located within the city limit of Williston approximately 0.5 miles<br>
west of the intersection of 56</span><span class="ft0">th </span><span class="ft2">Street NW and Highway 2 / 85 North.<br>
The facility runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and the rig is generally at the location for a<br>
several months. The site is occupied by at least 5 to 10 full time employees at all times. There<br>
are also contractors from various companies that frequent the site at different times of the day.<br>
The drill site will be the location for eight wells to be drilled in the Smith Farm and Heen<br>
spacing units (Sections 14 &amp; 23 and Sections 26 &amp; 35 respectively).<br>
Both the the Middle<br>
Bakken and Three Forks formations will be targeted and are expected to produce crude oil along<br>
with natural gas. There is the possibility of hydrogen sulfide gas to be present while drilling to<br>
the desired depth in the Middle Bakken and Three Forks formations. Hydrogen Sulfide is a<br>
naturally occurring gas mixed with natural gas or dissolved in the oil or brine and released upon<br>
exposure to atmospheric conditions.<br>
H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S concentration of the natural gas produced at this site is undetermined. This plan is for a well<br>
being drilled in an area where insufficient data exists.<br>

Definitions<br>
The following words and terms when used in this document shall have the following definitions<br>
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.<br>
Public Area: Includes any occupied residence, school, church, park, school bus stop, place of<br>
business, or other areas where the public could reasonably be expected to frequent; federal, state,<br>
county, or municipal road or highway owned and principally maintained for public use; and<br>
facilities or roads that are principally maintained for public use.<br>
Radius of Exposure (ROE): The estimated distance from the point of the gas escape where the<br>
H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S in the air is calculated to be at the specified concentration. Different regulatory agencies<br>
and production companies used differing calculation methods and site condition assumptions.<br>
To provide a more complete understanding of the data range from different estimation methods,<br>
three different ROEs will generally be presented. All three ROE methods will use an endpoint of<br>
100 ppm H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S consistent with both BLM and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) methods.<br>
3.3<br>
Potential Exposure Conditions<br>

Public Notification<br>
Steps relating to public notification are outlined to provide an organized procedure for notifying<br>
and evacuating residents, Statoil employees and contractors, and the general public in the event<br>
of an accidental release of a potentially hazardous volume of H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S gas or SO</span><span class="ft0">2 </span><span class="ft2">occurring from<br>
Statoil operated well site.<br>
5.1<br>
Procedures for Notifying the General Public<br>
The ultimate safety and protection of the general public residing within a close proximity of<br>
Statoil's operations is of utmost importance. There are public areas within the 3000 feet 100 ppm<br>
ROE (3000 ft) of the well location.<br>
5.1.1<br>
Advanced Briefing<br>
Statoil Oil &amp; Gas LP will assist the Williams County Emergency Manager in providing<br>
information to residents concerning the inherent dangers of H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S-bearing gas via a certified/return<br>
receipt informational letter. The letter will contain information on:<br>
· Hazards of H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S and SO</span><span class="ft0">2<br>
· Necessity for an Emergency Action Plan<br>
· Possible sources of H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S and SO</span><span class="ft0">2<br>
· Instructions for reporting a leak<br>
· The manner in which the public shall be notified of an emergency<br>
· Steps to be taken in case of an emergency including evacuation<br>
· Proper procedures for sheltering in place.<br>
5.1.2<br>
Warning Signs and Windsocks<br>
Warning signs and windsocks have been placed on many of the lease roads and at the production<br>
facility to alert the general public traveling on public roads.<br>
5.2<br>
Reporting Leaks to Statoil<br>
Statoil employees discovering a gas leak from a Statoil facility or well during normal business<br>
hours (8:00 AM to 5:00 PM) can contact the Statoil Local Field office at (701) 875-3300. To<br>
reach Statoil personnel after normal business hours or on weekends call (512) 427-3300. The<br>
after hours phone number is monitored by an answering service which will collect the required<br>
information and immediately contact Statoil personnel.<br>
A report form titled Incident Report Form located in Appendix D outlines the type of<br>
information that is required to properly assess the release and its potential impacts to site<br>
employees and surrounding communities. As much of the information outlined by the form<br>
should be gathered and reported as soon as possible.<br>

5.3<br>
Emergency Notification Procedures and Areas of Responsibilities<br>
The following steps will be taken in the event of a gas leak that may contain high levels of H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S<br>
(i.e. at or above 100 ppm of H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S):<br>
· In case of a release, Statoil employees will notify the designated Statoil Operations<br>
Supervisor will be notified. Phone numbers can be found in Section 4.0. If the Williams<br>
County Emergency Center receives a report of a possible leak from the member of the<br>
public or other local official, the Williams Operations Supervisor is to be contacted to<br>
evaluate the validity of the report.<br>
· A Statoil employee or contractor will be dispatched with appropriate field analyzers and<br>
personal protective equipment to the site to confirm a continuing release. The rig floor,<br>
the cellar, the mud tanks, and shale shaker areas potentially handling high concentrations<br>
of H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S are equipped with appropriate H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S sensors that have both visual and audible<br>
alarms. The employee must communicate the conditions at the site to the Statoil Site<br>
Manager as soon as possible, and before taking offensive action to isolate a continuing<br>
release.<br>
· If a continuing release is confirmed, the Statoil Site Manager will contact the Williams<br>
County Emergency Center at 911 to report conditions at the site. Specific support from<br>
civil authorities for the site, including traffic control, can be requested at that time.<br>
· The Williams County Emergency Center will contact the appropriate local first response<br>
organization to apprise them of the situation. A HazMat Incident Commander for these<br>
organizations will be designated at that time.<br>
· The Statoil Operations Site Incident Commander will assure the incident has been<br>
reported to appropriate Statoil Austin Headquarters personnel.<br>
· The HazMat Incident Commander will contact the Statoil Operations Site Incident<br>
Commander or other designated company representative to receive a situation report<br>
directly. Based on this exchange of information, the HazMat Incident Commander will<br>
mobilize local response agencies (law enforcement, fire departments, ambulance and/or<br>
medical services, etc.) via instructions to the Williams County Emergency Center. The<br>
primary focus of the civil Incident Commander is protection of personnel and property<br>
beyond the boundaries of the Statoil well location.<br>
· The Statoil Operations Site Incident Commander remains in control of response within<br>
the well location including activities to isolate and eliminate the source of the release.<br>
The Statoil Operations Site Incident Commander should request specific civil assistance<br>
for the site as necessary. Statoil personnel will remain under his/her direction for the<br>
duration of the incident.<br>
· The HazMat Incident Commander, in consultation with the Statoil Operations Site<br>
Incident Commander, will be responsible to issue evacuation or shelter-in-place orders to<br>
area residents. If such an order is given, the HazMat Incident Commander will work<br>
through the Emergency Center to notify residents and key governmental agencies through<br>
pre-designated media outlets, telephone, pager, and other electronic communication<br>
systems and direct contact by emergency responders consistent with their existing<br>
response procedures.<br>

Responsibilities and Duties of Key Personnel<br>
Statoil has a companywide Emergency Response Plan and Oil Contingency Plan (ERP-OCP)<br>
that should be consulted for any incident concerning a H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S release. A copy of the Statoil ERP-<br>
OCP can be obtained from Statoil supervisors and offices. Steps below are specific to a H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S<br>
release.<br>
7.1<br>
Detailed Procedures for Statoil Site Employees during a H</span><span class="ft4">2</span><span class="ft3">S Release<br>
Any personnel discovering an emergency condition in Statoil's operations, such as a blowout,<br>
flow line rupture, vessel rupture, etc., shall observe the following procedure:<br>
1. Leave the area immediately, moving upwind of the H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S source (use windsocks, if visible, to<br>
determine wind direction). While moving upwind, stay out of low areas and move uphill,<br>
especially under still or slight wind conditions.<br>
If unable to exit, put on respiratory<br>
protection equipment and attempt to notify rescue personnel of your location. Do not remove<br>
breathing equipment until air measurements indicate the air is safe to breathe.<br>
2. If an emergency shutdown station is located along your escape route and will not slow your<br>
escape, activate the shutdown and continue to move upwind. Note: Do not attempt to<br>
activate the emergency shutdown unless you have been trained to do so and are a<br>
certified First Responder under Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA)<br>
Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) guidelines.<br>
3. After leaving the area, immediately notify the Statoil Operations Incident Commander<br>
(OSIC) (normally the Operations Supervisor or designated relief), of the location of the<br>
release, including the location of any injured personnel. The Statoil OSIC will activate the<br>
H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S Contingency Plan.<br>
4. If you are qualified, use respiratory protection equipment and rescue any personnel who may<br>
be overcome by gases to a safe area upwind or isolated from the source of gas. DO NOT<br>
APPROACH or enter the emergency area without respiratory protection equipment. Follow<br>
the rescue procedure below.<br>
· Use the Buddy System.<br>
· Make sure personal H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S monitors are turned on.<br>
· Put a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) on pressure, not "demand."<br>
(Demand setting allows low pressure in mask to possibly draw in poison gas).<br>
· Maintain intrinsically safe radio communication as much as possible to inform the<br>
Incident Commander.<br>
· Move victim to a safe area for resuscitation or evacuation.<br>
· If air supply bell alarms, exit area immediately and get alternate air supply or go<br>
to safe area.<br>

H</span><span class="ft1">2</span><span class="ft0">S Mitigation Plan ­ Smith Farm / Heen Multi-Well Pad<br>
5. Do not attempt to shut off the source of the H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S until external notification has occurred and<br>
help has arrived. Air-supplied breathing equipment must be used unless isolating the source<br>
can be accomplished from a safe distance from the release (e.g. upstream block valve).<br>
6. Qualified personnel will take readings with an H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S meter to determine that the concentration<br>
has dropped to 10 ppm or less before people are allowed to enter the contaminated area<br>
without personal protective equipment (PPE).<br>
7. In the event of an H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S leak from any well, pipeline, or tank battery that exceeds a<br>
concentration of 10 ppm for one hour or anytime peak concentration remains at 100 ppm or<br>
above, company personnel will notify the Williams County Emergency Center at 911.<br>
Access roads to the site will be barricaded at a safe distance from the contaminated area.<br>
Access gates can be locked if necessary. The safe distance will be determined by testing the<br>
air for concentrations above 10 ppm using appropriate H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S detection equipment.<br>
7.2<br>
Operations Supervisor or Designated Alternate<br>
Upon notification of an emergency condition existing in Statoil's operations such as a blowout,<br>
flow line rupture, vessel rupture, etc., the Operations Supervisor or his designate shall observe<br>
the following procedure:<br>
1. The Operations Supervisor or designated alternate will usually be the OSIC. The OSIC will<br>
direct employees in shutting off the gas source, and report the incident to the Williams<br>
County Emergency Operation Center. The OSIC will also be responsible to engage company<br>
resources and area service companies, etc., as required to control the emission as well as<br>
mobilize spill response trailers if appropriate.<br>
2. The OSIC will request assistance from the County Sheriff or the State Highway Patrol for<br>
any necessary traffic control or notification and evacuation of any resident who may be<br>
endangered by the H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S emissions and for public road closures.<br>
3. The OSIC will direct employees to post barricades with signs noting the nature of the<br>
emission on all approaches to the contaminated area. No one will be allowed to enter the<br>
contaminated area without proper breathing equipment until the gas source has been shut off<br>
and the H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S or SO</span><span class="ft0">2 </span><span class="ft2">levels have dispersed.<br>
4. As soon as possible, the OSIC will notify the Statoil Field Operations Engineer and a HSE<br>
contact in the Austin office of the incident.<br>
5. The OSIC will delegate to either a Williston employee or Austin HSE staff the task of<br>
notifying appropriate regulatory agencies outlined in Section 6 Regulatory Reporting<br>
Requirements of this plan.<br>
6. The OSIC or a trained Hazmat Specialist will use an electronic multi-gas or another<br>
appropriate meter to ensure that the H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S level has dropped to 10 ppm or less before allowing<br>
people to enter the contaminated area without protective equipment.<br>

H</span><span class="ft1">2</span><span class="ft0">S Mitigation Plan ­ Smith Farm / Heen Multi-Well Pad<br>
7. If the source of the release cannot be isolated or eliminated, the OSIC in consultation with<br>
the local HazMat Incident Commander will determine if the situation warrants igniting the<br>
gas flow of a ruptured line, vessel, or an uncontrolled well. The decision should be made as<br>
a last resort in a situation where it is clear that personnel and property are endangered and<br>
there is no possibility of controlling the gas flow under prevailing conditions. However, the<br>
decision must not be delayed if human life is threatened. In all cases, an attempt should be<br>
made to notify appropriate Statoil's operations management prior to ignition. See Section<br>
7.5 for the proper ignition procedures.<br>
7.3<br>
Other Employee's Roles<br>
Other Statoil employees will be delegated specific roles depending on where they are located at<br>
the time of the release. They will remain under the direction of the Statoil OSIC.<br>
7.4<br>
Evacuation or Shelter-in-Place<br>
A decision to evacuate area residents, or shelter them in place will be made by the HazMat<br>
Incident Commander, in consultation with the Statoil OSIC. The order will be implemented with<br>
resources under the direction of the Williams County Emergency Center.<br>
Their automated<br>
"Reverse 911" telephone system and/or public media outlets and/or direct personnel contact by<br>
local officials will be conducted consistent with the Williams County Emergency Center's<br>
operational plan.<br>
7.5<br>
Procedures for Lighting a H</span><span class="ft5">2</span><span class="ft4">S Well<br>
Note: Before firing a flare gun or igniting flammable material, check the atmosphere at<br>
your location for H</span><span class="ft5">2</span><span class="ft4">S and combustible gas concentrations. Do not fire the flare if 10% or<br>
more of the lower explosive limit (LEL) is present. Be alert for ground fires<br>
1) OSIC in consultation the local HazMat Incident Commander, will determine if the<br>
situation warrants igniting the gas flow of a ruptured line, vessel, or an uncontrolled well.<br>
See item 7 in Section 7.1.<br>
2) Before a well is ignited, the Statoil OSIC representative should account for all personnel,<br>
note wind direction, and ascertain the impact to areas downwind and or within the gas<br>
cloud.<br>
3) A 25mm flare gun, with a range of 500 ft, is the primary method of igniting a well.<br>
4) Two people wearing self-contained breathing apparatus and flame resistant clothing are<br>
required to attempt to ignite an uncontrolled release. One person will be responsible for<br>
igniting the well while the other will serve as back-up and rescue.<br>
Each should be<br>
tethered to a 250 foot long safety line to accommodate non-entry rescue in the event of a<br>
mishap. Each tether shall be manned by separate individuals.<br>

July 2013<br>
H</span><span class="ft1">2</span><span class="ft0">S Mitigation Plan ­ Smith Farm / Heen Multi-Well Pad<br>
5) The well should always be ignited from upwind and the approach point should not be any<br>
closer than necessary.<br>
6) The location, from which the flare gun is to be fired, should be clear of debris and<br>
equipment to provide for a quick means of escape. The location should provide the<br>
maximum protection for the ignition team.<br>
7) Once the well is ignited, H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft2">S is converted to SO</span><span class="ft0">2 </span><span class="ft2">which is highly toxic and heavier than<br>
air resulting in its accumulation in low lying areas. Do not assume the area is safe once<br>
the well has been ignited.<br>
8) Once the well has been ignited, all non-essential personnel should be evacuated from the<br>
area. Some personnel may be assigned to site security to prevent access by the public.<br>

All releases of material at or above its reportable quantity (RQ) must be reported to the US Coast<br>
Guards National Response Center. The RQ for Hydrogen Sulfide is 100 lbs. or approximately<br>
the volume from an unrestrained release from the wellhead for a period of one minute if the plant<br>
is operating at maximum throughput. Even if the injection well check valve holds, the line fill<br>
from the compressor to the check valve contains approximately 314 lbs of H</span><span class="ft0">2</span><span class="ft3">S which is a<br>
reportable event.<br>
The Reportable Quantity for Sulfur Dioxide is 500 lbs. Even the line fill<br>

Hi Todd:<br>
Attached is a letter highlighting some of the best management practices that Statoil will use during<br>
the drilling of 8 wells on the Heen / Smith Farm well pad proposed for the NE ¼ NW ¼ of Section 26,<br>
T.155N R.101W.<br>
We are also providing a copy of the Statoil Emergency Response Plan and Hydrogen Sulfide<br>
Contingency Plan for your reference.<br>
As we discussed, the City of Williston's Planning &amp; Zoning Commission has granted Statoil approval<br>
for use of the proposed location which was recently annexed and now falls within city limits. In the<br>
next few days we will finalize the agreement with the City to share construction costs of the road<br>
along 56</span><span class="ft4">th </span><span class="ft3">Street NW. Also a copy of the landscaping plan that was presented and approved by the<br>
City of Williston is included. There were no other stipulations that the Williston Planning and Zoning<br>
Commission specified in their approval of our location.<br>
Please let me know if you have any additional concerns or questions.<br>
Thank you,<br>

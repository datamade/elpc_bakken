Dear Mike:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 22420, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft4">500' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft4">200' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the<br>
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 26 &amp; 27 T148N R93W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must<br>
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are<br>
conducted. KODIAK OIL &amp; GAS (USA) INC must contact NDIC Field Inspector Allen Christensen at<br>
701-989-9183 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum<br>
legal coordinate from the well head is: 9856' west.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft4">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

5. Two (2) choke line valves [three (3) inch minimum].<br>
6. Kill line (2-inch minimum).<br>
7. Two (2) chokes with one (1) remotely controlled from the rig floor.<br>
8. Two (2) kill line valves and a check valve [two (2) inch minimum].<br>
9. Upper and lower kelly cock valves with handles available.<br>
10. Safety valve(s) and subs to fit all drill string connections in use.<br>
11. Inside BOP or float sub available.<br>
12. Pressure gauge on choke manifold.<br>
13. Fill-up line above the uppermost preventer.<br>
B. Pressure Rating: 5,000 psi<br>
C. Testing Procedure:<br>
Annular Preventer<br>
At a minimum, the Annular Preventer will be pressure tested to 50% of the rated<br>
working pressure for the high test. A Low pressure test shall preformed to 250 psia for<br>
five (5) mins and a High pressure test shall be preformed to 2,500 psia for ten (10)<br>
minutes. At a minimum, the above pressure test will be performed:<br>
1. When the annular preventer is initially installed;<br>
2. Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken;<br>
3. Following related repairs; and<br>
4. At thirty (30) day intervals.<br>
In addition to the above, the annular preventer will be functionally operated at least<br>
weekly.<br>
Blow-Out Preventer<br>
At a minimum, the BOP, choke manifold, and related equipment will be pressure tested<br>
to the approved working pressure of the BOP stack (if isolated from the surface casing<br>
by a test plug) or to 70% of the internal yield strength of the surface casing (if the BOP<br>
is not isolated from the casing by a test plug). Pressure will be maintained for a period<br>
of at least ten (10) minutes or until the requirements of the test are met, whichever is<br>
longer. A Low pressure test shall preformed to 250 psia for five (5) mins and a High<br>
pressure test shall be preformed to 5,000 psia for ten (10) minutes. At a minimum, the<br>
above pressure test will be performed:<br>
1. When the BOP is initially installed;<br>
2. Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken;<br>
3. Following related repairs; and<br>
4. At thirty (30) day intervals.<br>
In addition to the above, the pipe and blind rams will be activated each trip, but not more<br>
than once each day. All BOP drills and tests will be recorded in the IADC driller's log.<br>
The Blow-Out Preventer (BOP) and all related pressure control equipment will be<br>
certified for service in a sour gas (H</span><span class="ft4">2</span><span class="ft0">S) environment in compliance with both Onshore<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Order Number 2 and Onshore Oil &amp; Gas Order Number 6.<br>

<hr>
<A name=27></a>Kodiak Oil &amp; Gas (USA) Inc.<br>
Moccasin Creek 8-26-27-4H3<br>
D. Choke Manifold Equipment:<br>
All choke lines will be straight lines unless turns use tee blocks or are targeted with<br>
running tees, and will be anchored to prevent whip and vibration. A 4" 10M flex hose<br>
may be used from the well head to the choke manifold.<br>
E. Accumulator:<br>
The accumulator will have sufficient capacity to open the hydraulically-controlled gate<br>
valve (if so equipped), close all rams plus the annular preventer, and retain a minimum<br>
of 200 psi above precharge on the closing manifold without the use of the closing unit<br>
pumps. The fluid reservoir capacity will be double the usable fluid volume of the<br>
accumulator system capacity and the fluid level of the reservoir will be maintained at the<br>
manufacturer's recommendations.<br>
The BOP system will have two (2) independent power sources available for powering<br>
the closing unit pumps. Sufficient nitrogen bottles are suitable as a backup power<br>
source only, and shall be recharged when the pressure falls below manufacturer's<br>
specifications. The accumulator precharge pressure test will be conducted prior to<br>
connecting the closing unit to the BOP stack and at least once every six (6) months<br>
thereafter. The accumulator pressure will be corrected if the measured precharge<br>
pressure is found to be above or below the maximum or minimum limits specified in<br>
Onshore Oil &amp; Gas Order Number 2 (only nitrogen gas may be used to precharge).<br>
A manual locking device (i.e., hand wheels) or automatic locking device will be<br>
installed. A valve will be installed in the closing line as close as possible to the annular<br>
preventer to act as a locking device. This valve will be maintained in the open position<br>

The 7" intermediate casing will be landed in the horizontal section of the Bakken Formation before<br>
commencement of drilling the lateral.<br>
3<br>
Kodiak may elect to have the liner isolated with swell packers or equivalent.<br>
The surface casing will have centralizers on the bottom three (3) joints with a stop ring<br>
utilized midway on the shoe joint. Then every third joint for a total of 17 centralizers.<br>
Casing string(s) will be pressure tested to 0.22 psi/foot of casing string length or 1,500<br>
psi, whichever is greater (not to exceed 70% of the internal yield strength of the casing),<br>
after cementing and prior to drilling out from under the casing shoe.<br>
The 7" intermediate casing string has been designed for service in a sour gas (H</span><span class="ft4">2</span><span class="ft0">S) and<br>
salt environment. The intermediate casing will have turbolizers on the bottom three (3)<br>
joints, then every other joint to 45 degrees. Centralizers will be used every other jt from<br>
45 degrees to KOP, then every fourth joint to the top of the Dakota sands.<br>
The 4½" liner will be centralized with standoff bands on every other joint.<br>
B. Cementing Program:<br>
Surface Casing<br>
- Lead with approximately 500 sx Econocem W1 + 0.25 pps Poly<br>
E Flake cement mixed at 11.5 ppg (yield = 2.98 ft</span><span class="ft4">3</span><span class="ft0">/sx).<br>
Tail with approximately 225 sx SwiftCem + 0.25 pps Poly E<br>
Flake mixed at 14.2 ppg (yield = 1.49 ft</span><span class="ft4">3</span><span class="ft0">/sx). Cement will be<br>
circulated back to surface with 40% excess. Top out if<br>
necessary.<br>

0.25 pps Poly E Flake + 35% SSA-1 mixed at 15.6 ppg (yield =<br>
1.56 ft</span><span class="ft3">3</span><span class="ft0">/sx).<br>
Lead cement will be circulated half way into the 9 5/8" shoe,<br>
about 1200' MD.<br>
Liner Casing-<br>
Tail with approximately 550 sx EXTENDACEM + 0.55% HR-5<br>

ppg (yield = 1.77 ft</span><span class="ft3">3</span><span class="ft0">/sx). TOC above the PBR.<br>
The above cement volumes are approximate and were calculated under the assumption that a<br>
gauge hole will be achieved with a 10% excess factor. Actual cement volumes may vary due to<br>
variations in the actual hole gauge and may be determined by running a caliper log on the drilled<br>
hole.<br>
All waiting on cement (WOC) times will be adequate to achieve a minimum of 500 psi<br>
compressive strength at the casing shoe prior to drilling out.<br>

LOT4 Section 31-152N-99W<br>
McKenzie County<br>
Well File # 29495<br>
Dear Mike:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 22124, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, </span><span class="ft2">shall be located<br>
approximately down the north-south axis </span><span class="ft0">(500' drilling corridor per Commission policy) and be no closer than the </span><span class="ft2">200'<br>
setback </span><span class="ft0">from the north &amp; south boundaries within the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 30 &amp; 31 T152N<br>
R99W and Sections 25 &amp; 36 T152 N R100W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter<br>
sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site<br>
during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. An isolation<br>
packer must be set at a point no greater than 250' from the West line of Section 31 and the perforations in the<br>
4.5&quot; liner must be located entirely within the Commission's 500' drilling corridor. KODIAK OIL &amp; GAS<br>
(USA) INC must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling<br>
and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent<br>
pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are<br>
prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill<br>
cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is:<br>
636 W. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 9746<br>
W.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be<br>
waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to<br>
evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that<br>
would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the<br>
applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given<br>
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck,<br>
via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling<br>
contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m.<br>
to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must<br>
be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the<br>
directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the<br>
director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a<br>
certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or<br>
when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is hereby<br>
granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing on the date<br>
the well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well records<br>
wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall permit the<br>
Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or controlled by them,<br>
complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to have access at all times to<br>
any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect producing and drilling wells. Any<br>
information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time upon request. The information so<br>
obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and shall be available only to the Commission<br>
and its staff.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours,<br>
and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the<br>
plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well<br>
bore, and (3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic<br>
cement evaluation log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior<br>
to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format)<br>
copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or<br>
attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov </span><span class="ft0">Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

EVALUATION PROGRAM<br>
Logs<br>
: The logging program will be run by Schlumberger and will consist of their<br>
Platform Express plus BHC Sonic from 11514</span><span class="ft3">' </span><span class="ft0">to 2282</span><span class="ft3">'</span><span class="ft0">. The Gamma Ray<br>
and resistivity log will be pulled back to surface.<br>
The evaluation program may change at the discretion of the well site geologist.<br>
COMPLETION<br>
The planned top of the 4.5" 11.6" production liner will be 50-100 ft above the kick off point.<br>
This liner will be cemented throughout the lateral and a wet shoe sub will be set at the toe of the<br>
liner. The frac string will be 12.75# P-110 with TSHP threads and stung into a PBR run with the<br>
liner hanger prior to the fracturing treatment. Current plans are for 28 stages using a plug and<br>
perf approach.<br>
ABNORMAL CONDITIONS<br>
No abnormal temperatures or pressures are anticipated. Hydrogen sulfide (H</span><span class="ft5">2</span><span class="ft0">S) may be<br>
encountered in the Mission Canyon Formation at a TVD of approximately 9854</span><span class="ft3">'</span><span class="ft0">. Safety<br>
equipment will be in operation at approximately 9354</span><span class="ft3">'</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Maximum anticipated bottom hole pressure equals approximately 5944 psi (calculated at<br>
0.53 psi/foot at Middle Bakken target depth, 11,216') and maximum anticipated surface<br>
pressure equals approximately 3477 psi (bottom hole pressure minus the pressure of a<br>
partially evacuated hole calculated at 0.22 psi/foot at Middle Bakken target depth). The<br>
intermediate design casing will be run and cemented before drilling the target lateral.<br>
Reservoir temperature is anticipated to be 244F.<br>

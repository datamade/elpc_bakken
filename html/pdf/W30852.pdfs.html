SESW Section 33-155N-99W<br>
Williams County<br>
Well File # 30852<br>
Dear Shawn:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24780, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft4">200' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft4">500' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the east &amp; west boundaries within<br>
the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 4 &amp; 9, T154N R99W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the<br>
entire location. Also, effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock<br>
disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site<br>
during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. Lastly,<br>
WHITING OIL AND GAS CORP must contact NDIC Field Inspector Jessica Gilkey at 701-770-7340<br>
prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing<br>
point is: 588' S. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well<br>
head is: 10745' S.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft3">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

EVALUATION PROGRAM<br>
Logs<br>
: The logging program will be run by Schlumberger and will consist of their<br>
Platform Express plus BHC Sonic from 11523</span><span class="ft3">' </span><span class="ft0">to 2303</span><span class="ft3">'</span><span class="ft0">. The Gamma Ray<br>
and resistivity log will be pulled back to surface.<br>
The evaluation program may change at the discretion of the well site geologist.<br>
COMPLETION<br>
The planned top of the 4.5" 11.6" production liner will be 50-100 ft above the kick off point.<br>
This liner will be cemented throughout the lateral and a wet shoe sub will be set at the toe of the<br>
liner. The frac string will be 12.75# P-110 with TSHP threads and stung into a PBR run with the<br>
liner hanger prior to the fracturing treatment. Current plans are for 28 stages using a plug and<br>
perf approach.<br>
No diesel fuels, as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency<br>
(USEPA), will be used in the hydraulic fracturing of this well.<br>
USEPA identifies diesel fuels as any compound identified with the following Chemical<br>
Abstract Service Registry Numbers:<br>
68334-30-5 (Primary Name: Fuels, diesel)<br>
68476-34-6 (Primary Name: Fuels, diesel, No. 2)<br>
68476-30-2 (Primary Name: Fuel oil No. 2)<br>
68476-31-3 (Primary Name: Fuel oil, No. 4)<br>
8008-20-6 (Primary Name: Kerosene)<br>
ABNORMAL CONDITIONS<br>
No abnormal temperatures or pressures are anticipated. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) may be<br>
encountered in the Mission Canyon Formation at a TVD of approximately 9763'. Safety<br>
equipment will be in operation at approximately 9263</span><span class="ft3">'</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Maximum anticipated bottom hole pressure equals approximately 5930psi (calculated at 0.53<br>
psi/foot at Middle Bakken target depth, 11,188') and maximum anticipated surface pressure<br>
equals approximately 3468 psi (bottom hole pressure minus the pressure of a partially evacuated<br>
hole calculated at 0.22 psi/foot at Middle Bakken target depth). The intermediate design casing<br>
will be run and cemented before drilling the target lateral.<br>
Reservoir temperature is anticipated to be 244F.<br>

8<br>
2/27/2015<br>
Estimated 1st Production:<br>
4 wells 7/16 &amp; 4 wells 10/17<br>
Flowback Strategy: Gas pipeline installation prior to flow back operations. 4 wells will be completed at a time. Each well will<br>
be flowed through flowback test units for 3-7 days per well for wellbore clean up, then turned to<br>
permanent production facilities. Two flow back test units will be used on the set of 4 wells. Gas will be<br>
sold from the flow back test units with the aid of gas coolers. Individual well IP rates should average 1<br>
MMCFPD per well for 3-7 days, and 0.67 MMCFPD average for 1st Month. Maximum total pad gas<br>
production 3.5 MMCFPD, and 3 MMCFPD average for 1st Month. When 2nd set of 4 wells are completed<br>
maximum will be 4.5MMCFPD.<br>
Gathering Information<br>
Gas Gatherer: ONEOK<br>
Address:<br>
100 W. Fifth Street Tulsa, OK 74103<br>
Processing Plant Name: Stateline<br>
Location:<br>
SEC10-T155N-R102W<br>
Current Daily Capacity: 220 MMcfd<br>
Anticipated Daily Capacity:<br>
240 MMCFPD<br>
Current Throughput: 195 MMcfd<br>
Anticipated Throughput:<br>
210 MMCFPD<br>
Tie-in point: ONEOK 14&quot; Poly line located in NENW Sec.4 T154N R99W; Williams County ND (see map below)<br>
Expansion Plans: A new 30MM compressor station will be coming on end of 2014. 50MMCFPD additional compression 6-<br>
2015. The Stateline facility is currently taking approximately 50 MMCFPD from McKenzie County.<br>
Additional capacity will be available when this gas is diverted back when the Garden Creek Plant II<br>
(100MM, Q3 2014), and Garden Creek III (100MM, Q1 2015) as they are put online. Garden Creek plants<br>
are near Watford City. ONEOK will balance capacity between plants.<br>

Field Flare%:<br>
42% (July-14)<br>
North Dakota Flare %:<br>
29% (July-14)<br>
Alternatives to Flaring: This location will be connected to pipeline prior to production. Flaring will be reduced, when required, by<br>
utilizing NGL recovery units, natural gas generators, and to run other equipment. Gas coolers are also<br>
utilized to cool the temperature of the initial gas production that is above the temperature of the pipeline<br>
specification, so it can be sold. Currently, Kodiak Oil and Gas has NGL recovery in place and operating on<br>
28 Wells (7 Pads) where pipeline has been delayed due to ROW issues. In addition, Kodiak has contracted<br>
2 drilling rigs in Q3 2014 that can run on dry natural gas that is a product of the NGL recovery effort.<br>
Additional measures to limit flaring will include scheduling wellwork and initial production testing to limit<br>
peak gas production.<br>

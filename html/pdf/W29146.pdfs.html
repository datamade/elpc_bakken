Well File # 29146<br>
Dear Brittany:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 21687, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft4">200' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft4">500' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the east &amp; west boundaries within<br>
the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 8 &amp; 5, T150N R101W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must<br>
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are<br>
conducted. Also, TRIANGLE USA PETROLEUM CORPORATION must take into consideration<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above<br>
captioned location. Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) "No boiler, portable electric<br>
lighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank."<br>
Placement as close as one hundred twenty-five feet [38.10 meters] may be allowed if a spark or flame<br>
arrestor is utilized on the equipment. Lastly, TRIANGLE USA PETROLEUM must contact NDIC<br>
Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum<br>
legal coordinate from the well head is: 9617N.<br>

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft4">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>

Hi Matt,<br>
Please see comments in red below. If you have any further questions or concerns please let me<br>
know.<br>
·<br>
We will need the estimated capacity and throughput as listed under 3c and 3d.<br>
Because these wells are not scheduled to be turned to sales until January of 2015, OneOk is<br>
not willing to provide inaccurate information on the capacity and throughput. We have<br>
received approval by putting TBD on this portion of the GCP in the past, have the approval<br>
requirements changed.<br>
·<br>
Concerning entry 3a, which compressor is meant? Is this maximum capacity for the<br>
pipeline between the pad and compressor or something else?<br>
Production has confirmed that this gas will go south to the Cherry Creek Compressor and<br>
either to the existing Stateline Plant or to one of the new Garden Creek Plants. The max<br>
capacity for the Cherry Creek Compressor is 40 MMCFD with a current thru-put of 25<br>
MMCFD to that compressor station.<br>
· Concerning entry 4a, for what well is this estimated date of first production? It seems<br>
odd that it is set in January of 2014 if it is meant to be one or all of the APD's.<br>
DOFS for the 5&amp;6H would be 2/4/2015, for the 7&amp;8H DOFS would be 2/14/2015 according<br>
to our most recent drill schedule. The original GCP had the incorrect year listed.<br>
·<br>
For entry 6, we need an estimated percentage of reduced flaring due to the plans (per<br>
entry 6b on the letter that was sent out).<br>
NGL skids are estimated to reduce VOC emission by around 63%. Current Statewide % flared<br>
as of 7/29/2014 is 33.33% therefore with a 63% reduction in flaring we'd be looking at a<br>
reduction of about 20.79%.<br>
·<br>
The map is a little hard to read since there are so many lengths of pipeline in the area.<br>
Along which line is the gas to be piped?<br>
Please see the attached maps provided by OneOk.<br>
·<br>
We prefer that the destination gas processing plant be shown on the map (per entry 2a<br>
on the letter). Would it be possible to show this on the map for this plan? If not, would it be<br>
possible to have another map which depicts the plant in relation to the pad with the<br>
pipeline between them?<br>
Please see the attached maps provided by OneOk.<br>
Thank you!<br>

Brittany,<br>
We have a few questions on the J Garvin Jacobson Gas Capture Plan.<br>
·<br>
We will need the estimated capacity and throughput as listed under 3c and 3d.<br>
·<br>
Concerning entry 3a, which compressor is meant? Is this maximum capacity for the<br>
pipeline between the pad and compressor or something else?<br>
·<br>
Concerning entry 4a, for what well is this estimated date of first production? It seems<br>
odd that it is set in January of 2014 if it is meant to be one or all of the APD's.<br>
·<br>
For entry 6, we need an estimated percentage of reduced flaring due to the plans (per<br>
entry 6b on the letter that was sent out).<br>
·<br>
The map is a little hard to read since there are so many lengths of pipeline in the area.<br>
Along which line is the gas to be piped?<br>
·<br>
We prefer that the destination gas processing plant be shown on the map (per entry 2a<br>
on the letter). Would it be possible to show this on the map for this plan? If not, would it be<br>
possible to have another map which depicts the plant in relation to the pad with the<br>
pipeline between them?<br>
Let me know if any of these questions are unclear or you have any concerns.<br>

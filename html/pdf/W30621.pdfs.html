SESW Section 17-158N-95W<br>
Williams County<br>
Well File # 30621<br>
Dear Terry:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24759, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval<br>
is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' setback<br>
from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit<br>
consisting of Sections 8 &amp; 17 T158N-R95W. </span><span class="ft4">*The W/2 SW/4 of Section 8 is within both the McGregor and<br>
Temple Fields.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: LIBERTY RESOURCES MANAGEMENT COMPANY, LLC must take into<br>
consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the<br>
above captioned location. Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) "No boiler, portable electric<br>
lighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank." Effective<br>
June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be maintained on the<br>
well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-<br>
back whenever filtration operations are conducted. LIBERTY RES MNGMT CO must contact NDIC Field<br>
Inspector Tom Delling at 701-770-8660 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling<br>
and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent<br>
pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are<br>
prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill<br>
cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal<br>
coordinate from the well head is: 10109 N.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be<br>
waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to<br>
evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that<br>
would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the<br>
applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall<br>
file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be<br>
submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the<br>
directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the<br>
director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a<br>
certification cover page to </span><span class="ft5">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft4">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or<br>
when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours,<br>
and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the<br>
plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well<br>
bore, and (3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic<br>
cement evaluation log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior<br>
to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format)<br>
copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or<br>
attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft5">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

A. Casing head: 9 5/8&quot; x 11&quot; 5M multi-bowl w/ flange 22&quot; below GL,Initial BOPE test to 5000 psi. unless 9 5/8&quot; is pre set then SOW<br>
Tubing head 11&quot; 5M x 7 1/16&quot; 10M. BOPE test to 5000 psi before drilling out 7&quot; casing shoe.<br>
B. Operators minimum specifications for pressure control equipment are shown on the attached BOP<br>
schematic. After running surface casing and prior to drilling out, blind rams, pipe rams, manifold,<br>
upper and lower kelly cock and safety valve will be pressure tested to 5000 psi. Hydril will be tested<br>
to 2500 psi. Thereafter, the BOPE will be checked daily for mechanical operations and will be noted<br>
in the IADC drilling reports. Before and after running the intermediate casing the BOPE will be tested<br>
in the same manner. BOP will be tested at both high 5000 psi and low pressure to 250 psi.<br>
Gas Buster will be fully rigged up and tested for fluid integrity, using anti-freeze solution<br>
prior to drilling out surface casing.<br>

D. Other Drilling Considerations &amp; Lessons Learned:<br>
1. Gas Buster- Not to be used for venting off flowline. Divert all flow to gas buster.<br>
2. Lateral Drilling- Minimize DLS.<br>
3. Salt Sections: Tight hole and stuck pipe may occur. Control drill +/-5' and back-ream<br>
as necessary. Spot freshwater only if severely stuck.<br>
4. Do not rotate PDC bit inside 7&quot; casing while displacing well with kill weight fluids.<br>
Ensure bit &amp; motor are in open hole section.<br>
5. Transfer OBM from storage tanks to rig tanks over the shaker screens.<br>
6. CaCL Brine truck to location after running/cmt'g 7 inch csg. To be determined each well.<br>

I have received your applications for the request of a legal street address for the wells listed below. As of right now we are not issuing any<br>
addresses for oil wells. I do realize though that you still have to apply for them according to the Century Code. I will be keeping record of your<br>
applications. A working group has been set up for the state of North Dakota to discuss this topic. If you have any questions in the meantime,<br>
please contact me and I will do my best to answer them.<br>

c. The proposed route and tie-in point to connect the subject wells to an existing gas line:<br>
Williams County, T158N, R95W. See Figure 2<br>
3. Information on the existing line, to which operator proposes to connect to, including:<br>
a. Maximum current daily capacity of the existing gas line or compressor:<br>
5 mmcfd; but with expansion project to increase to 30 mmcfd.<br>
b. Current throughput of the existing gas line or compressor:<br>
~5 mmcfd.<br>
c. Anticipated daily capacity of existing gas line or compressor at date of first gas sales:<br>
30 mmcfd with completion of planned line upgrade.<br>
d. Anticipated throughput of existing gas line or compressor at date of first gas sales:<br>
10 mmcfd ramping up to 14 mmcfd with completion of subject wells.<br>
e. Gas gatherer issues or expansion plans for the area:<br>
Recently expanded Tioga Gas Plant from 110 mmcfd to 250 mmcfd. Plans in place to<br>
expand system in T158N R95W area with additional line to increase capacity to 30<br>
mmcfd.<br>
4. A detailed flowback strategy including:<br>
a. Anticipated date of first production.<br>
September 3, 2015.<br>
b. Anticipated oil and gas rates and duration. If well is on a multi-well pad, include total<br>
for all wells being completed.<br>
Anticipated Oil and Gas Rates and Duration: Well production rates estimated as 1000<br>
bopd and 1 mmcfd initial production rate average for 30 days with oil rate declining at<br>
80% thereafter.<br>
Anticipated Oil and Gas Rates and Duration (Multi-Well Pad):<br>
Total production rate for five wells on pad is ~4000 BOPD and 4 mmcfd expected initial<br>
production rate average for 30 days with oil rate declining at 80% thereafter .<br>
5. Amount of gas the company is currently flaring.<br>
a. Statewide percentage of gas flared (total gas flared/total gas produced) for existing<br>
wells producing from the Bakken petroleum system. Note the Commission's approved<br>
gas capture goals are to reduce flaring to 26% by October 1, 2014, 23% by January 1,<br>
2015, 15% by January 1, 2016, and 10% by October 1, 2020:<br>
Statewide percentage of gas flared for existing Liberty operated wells in November 2014<br>
was 24%.<br>
b. Field-wide percentage of gas flared:<br>
Field-wide (McGregor Field) percentage of gas flared for existing Liberty operated wells<br>
in November 2014 was 0%.<br>

6. Alternatives to flaring.<br>
a. Explain specific alternate systems available for consideration:<br>
We have evaluated alternative gas utilization schemes including gas fired power<br>
generation and pad processing to separate gas liquids.<br>
b. Detail expected flaring reductions if such plans are implemented:<br>
Based upon our existing gas connections and proximity to gas gathering lines and the<br>
Tioga Gas Plant, we do not require additional options for flaring reductions. However,<br>
we will continue to evaluate pad processing and gas utilization options to maximize gas<br>
capture.<br>

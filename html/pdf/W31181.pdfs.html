SWSW Section 2-142N-96W<br>
Dunn County<br>
Well File # 31181<br>
Dear Rebecca:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 25107, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft3">200' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the<br>
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Section 2-T142N-R96W &amp; Section 35-T143N-R96W. </span><span class="ft4">Tool error is not<br>
required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to a drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding<br>
the entire location.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock<br>
disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site<br>
during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. OXY USA<br>
INC must contact NDIC Field Inspector Nicole Nelson at 701-290-1527 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum<br>
legal coordinates from the well head are: 9845 N &amp; 160 W.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Conductors, Rat holes, and Mouse holes <br>
To protect near surface groundwater any conductor, rat, or mouse hole drilled must be constructed with a string <br>
of casing and cemented to ground level.  Any such string must be secured at the surface when not in use.  In addition, <br>
all rat and mouse holes must be plugged with cement and cut off at least 4' below final grade within a reasonable <br>
timeframe after the rig completes drilling operations on the pad. <br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft5">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the<br>
well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS<br>
(log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

wells to its gathering system.<br>
Oxy provides (on a monthly basis) to ONEOK a drilling,<br>
completion and estimated first production date for all wells that are scheduled to be drilled in the<br>
foreseeable future. In addition, Oxy and ONEOK have conference calls, usually bi-weekly, to<br>
discuss connection status of wells and changes to Oxy's drilling and completion schedules.<br>
Gathering System<br>
ONEOK's gathering system in this area is a dynamic system that has multiple compressor<br>
stations with common suction lines. Gas produced from this pad will have a primary flow path<br>
to ONEOK's Lodgepole compressor station and secondary flow paths to ONEOK's Killdeer and<br>
Little Knife compressor stations. The actual flow of the gas will be based on compression<br>
operating parameters and gathering system pressures. Gas gathered on this part of ONEOK's<br>
gathering system is processed at ONEOK's Grassland Processing Plant located in Section 36,<br>
T146N, R105W, McKenzie County, North Dakota.<br>
In addition to ONEOK, Hiland has a low pressure gathering line .25 miles east of this pad<br>
location. Hiland's lines, along with ONEOK's, are shown on the attached map.<br>
The production facilities for the Robert Sadowsky 8-2-35H-142-96 and Robert Sadowsky 9-2-<br>
35H-142-96 will be located less than 1,250' from ONEOK's existing 8.625" outside diameter<br>
(OD) low pressure gathering line. The connection to ONEOK will require less than 1,250' of<br>
4.50" OD low pressure gathering line and related facilities.<br>
Existing Lines<br>
3<br>
<hr>
<A name=25></a>At the terminus of the metering, associated piping at each well's production facilities and the<br>
1,250' of 4.50" OD low pressure gathering line noted above, a connection will be made to an<br>
existing 8.625" OD gathering line. This 8.625" OD gathering line extends approximately one-<br>
half mile before connecting to a 12.75" OD gathering line. This 12.75" OD gathering line<br>
traverses 4 miles before connecting to a 16" OD gathering line. The 16" OD gathering line<br>
extends approximately 27 miles and then connects to the inlet station piping at ONEOK's<br>
Lodgepole compressor station. This will be the primary flow path of gas delivered to ONEOK<br>
from this pad. As noted under "Gathering System", above, the gas will have secondary flow<br>
paths due to the dynamics of ONEOK's gathering system. The table below shows the capacities<br>
and current flows of the primary gathering lines connecting this well.<br>
ONEOK's low pressure gathering system is near capacity in this area due to continuing<br>
development of the fields in this area. It is projected that the system will have capacity when<br>
these wells are ready for production due to decline on the existing wells gathered on this segment<br>
of the system and ONEOK's continuing efforts to maximize flow on its gathering system(s).<br>
ONEOK is in the process of adding compressors at its Lost Bridge compressor station in Section<br>
14, T147N, R96W, Dunn County and installing a 16" OD low pressure gathering line that will<br>
start in T145N, R94W, Dunn County (Dunn Center) and end at the inlet of the Lost Bridge<br>
compressor station. Construction of these facilities will redirect gas that currently flows on the<br>
primary and secondary flow paths of the Robert Sadowsky SWSW 2 Pad to flow on the new<br>
facilities. Although this does not directly increase the capacity of the primary and secondary<br>
flow paths of the Robert Sadowsky SWSW 2 Pad, it redirects gas that currently flows on the<br>
same pipelines to a different compressor station, in essence reducing volumes transported on the<br>
flow paths for this well. ONEOK is also planning on constructing a new discharge line from its<br>
Lost Bridge compressor station that will deliver some of the gas currently processed at<br>
ONEOK's Grasslands Processing Plant to ONEOK's Garden Creek Processing Plant(s).<br>
ONEOK has announced plans to construct the Bear Creek natural gas processing plant and<br>
related natural gas and natural gas liquids infrastructure in Dunn County, North Dakota. The<br>
Bear Creek natural gas processing plant and related facilities are expected to be operation during<br>
the second quarter of 2016. In addition, ONEOK Demicks Lake natural gas processing plant,<br>
located in McKenzie County, North Dakota, is expected to be operational during the third quarter<br>
of 2016.<br>

<A name=26></a>Flowback Strategy<br>
After the fracture treatments, these wells will be flowed through a choke to test production tanks.<br>
Choke size will depend on final shut in pressure post frac and well pressure prior to opening the<br>
choke. The choke will be adjusted up or down based on flowing pressure, liquid rates and sand<br>
returns, to prevent clogging manifold chokes. During flowback, the water chlorides and sand<br>
content will be monitored. When the water chlorides are greater than 100,000 ppm and the<br>
produced fluids contain no sand, these wells will be turned to production facilities.<br>
The<br>
gathering pipeline and Oxy's production facilities should be constructed before flowback starts<br>
allowing gas sales to start as soon as the well starts flowing through the production facilities,<br>
unless there are capacity issues on ONEOK's system at that time. Based on current information,<br>
it is our belief the system can take this gas upon completion of this well.<br>
Each well on this pad will initially flow 445 barrels of oil and 200 thousand cubic feet (MCF) of<br>
gas per day based on Oxy's well type curve for this area. This results in an initial production rate<br>
of 890 barrels oil a day and 400 MCF gas day from the pad. It is anticipated these wells will<br>
decline sharply after initial production as do the majority of horizontal wells in the Williston<br>
Basin.<br>
Current Flaring<br>
The table below shows gas produced, used on lease and sold by Oxy per Gas Production Report -<br>
Form 5B that was filed by Oxy for October 2014 reporting period. The percent sold and percent<br>
flared are also shown in the table.<br>
Flaring Alternative<br>
These wells will be connected to a pipeline prior to production and Oxy does not expect to flare<br>
gas from these wells.<br>
Below are three alternatives that Oxy considered from a conceptual<br>
standpoint to reduce the amount of gas flared. More generally, Oxy is continuing to review the<br>
5<br>
<hr>
<A name=27></a>possible impact of implementing one or more of these alternatives as appropriate in our<br>
operations.<br>
1) NGL Removal ­ On Lease<br>
Captures highest value components in gas stream<br>
Plants are expensive<br>
Uneconomical to operate when volume declines<br>
Residue gas is still flared<br>
2) Power Generation ­ On Lease<br>
Savings if current generation's fuel supply is diesel<br>
Only a portion of gas is consumed operating the generator, remainder of gas will<br>
be flared<br>
Due to gas quality, high NGL content, preference is to purchase power from the<br>
grid and not operate generation on site<br>
3) Compressed Natural Gas ­ On lease<br>
Well site compressors are required to fill CNG trailers<br>
Large capital outlay for equipment and operating cost, includes trucking of<br>
products, are expensive<br>
No gas would be flared, but might be uneconomical to operate when gas volume<br>
declines<br>

22, Dickinson, North Dakota 58601) I and/or personnel under my direction made a survey on the 26th day of November 2014, for the Surface Hole Location and Elevation of<br>
platted well, being located within the SW1/4SW1/4 of Section 2, T142N, R96W of the 5th P.M., Dunn County, State of North Dakota.<br>
Notes: All Azimuths are based on the South line of Section 2, T142N, R96W of the 5th P.M., being an Azimuth of 269°50'09&quot; using GPS observations, occupying a WHS<br>
control point (5/8" rebar) and having the Location and Elevation derived from an OPUS Solution and GEOID 09. Azimuths shown have been rotated 1°40'38.89043&quot; West<br>
from SPC Grid bearings to Geodetic North, based on convergence angle provided by a conversion using Corpscon.<br>
Project elevations are held on the control point located 93°05'13&quot;, 3376.17 Feet, from the Northeast Corner of Section 2, T142N, R96W of the 5th P.M. having a NAVD 88<br>
elevation of 2244.72.<br>

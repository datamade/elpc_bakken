HORIZONTAL WELL<br>
UHLMAN FEDERAL 7-7H<br>
LOT4 Section 7-152N-99W<br>
McKenzie County<br>
Well File # 30977<br>
Dear Becky:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 25998, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval<br>
is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' setback<br>
from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 2560 acre spacing unit<br>
consisting of Sections 6, 7, 18, &amp; 19-T152N-R99W. </span><span class="ft4">Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: The NDIC must be notified of any significant changes to Continental's<br>
Pittsburgh/Uhlman Development Plan. Two horizontal wells shall be drilled and completed in the standup<br>
1280-acre spacing unit described as Sections 6 and 7, T152N, R99W, McKenzie County, North Dakota, prior<br>
to completing any horizontal well in the 2560-acre spacing unit described as Sections 6, 7, 18, and 19, T152N,<br>
R99W. The proper spacing for the development of Zone XXI in the Banks-Bakken Pool is hereby set at a<br>
minimum of four horizontal wells. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain<br>
on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted.<br>
CONTINENTAL RESOURCES must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to<br>
location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling<br>
and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent<br>
pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are<br>
prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill<br>
cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal<br>
coordinates from the well head are: 10721 N &amp; 80 W.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be<br>
waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to<br>
evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that<br>
would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the<br>
applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that<br>
notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas<br>
Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit<br>
number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00<br>
p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours<br>
or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall<br>
file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be<br>
submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the<br>
directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the<br>
director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a<br>
certification cover page to </span><span class="ft4">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft3">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or<br>
when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Conductors, Rat holes, and Mouse holes <br>
To protect near surface groundwater any conductor, rat, or mouse hole drilled must be constructed with a string of <br>
casing and cemented to ground level.  Any such string must be secured at the surface when not in use.  In addition, all rat <br>
and mouse holes must be plugged with cement and cut off at least 4' below final grade within a reasonable timeframe after <br>
the rig completes drilling operations on the pad. <br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours,<br>
and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the<br>
plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well<br>
bore, and (3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic<br>
cement evaluation log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior<br>
to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format)<br>
copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or<br>
attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft4">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>

Re:<br>
Continental Resources standard CCL, CBL, 4-1/2" liner running and testing procedures<br>
Continental Resources' standard practice for running the cement bond log and casing<br>
caliper log is to run both logs immediately after coming out of the hole after TD, prior to running<br>
the 4-1/2" liner, to the deepest depth obtainable; however, if there are well control concerns that<br>
require us to run the liner sooner, only the CBL will be run and the CCL will be run after setting<br>
the liner.<br>
Based on the CCL results, we determine the actual API minimum burst allowance for the 7"<br>
casing. If the downgraded API burst pressure is below our minimum required frac pressures, we<br>
will run a 4-1/2" frac string; if severe wear or holes are found in the casing, we will run a 5"<br>
cemented, to surface, tie back string.<br>
The CBL log is run in order to determine the top of cement, as required by the NDIC.<br>
Our current 4-1/2" liner program for a 1280 unit is 30, evenly spaced, stages with 29 swellable<br>
packers. The liner shoe is set approximately 180 feet off bottom. The shoe stage below the last<br>
packer has 2 joints, a double valved float, one joint, and a ported guide shoe ­ appx 130 ft. The<br>
liner is run using a running tool on the end of 4" DP. The 7" packer/hanger is set about 40 ft<br>
above KOP between two casing collars but conditions occasionally occur that require setting<br>
higher, either through unexpected failure or in order to isolate casing wear close to KOP.<br>
Recently we have tried 40 stage liners and the trend to explore the optimum stage count will<br>
continue.. Once the liner is at depth, a ball is dropped through the DP, the ball is pressured up<br>
against the setting tool to approximately 2500 psi, and the 7" packer/hanger is set.<br>
A push pull test is done to confirm the hanger has set. Then, a 4500 psi pressure test is<br>
completed on the back side of the 4" DP to confirm the packer has set. The setting tool is then<br>
backed off and the 4" DP/running tool is laid down.<br>
Immediately after the rotary rig has been moved off the well location, the 7" csg and liner<br>
packer/ hanger are tested to the frac pressure. The testers will rig up and test the tubing head to<br>
5000 psi. Next a test plug will be run and set, using wire line, in the top of the 7" packer/hanger.<br>
Testers will pressure up to our frac pressure, typically 8500 psi, to confirm the 7" is ready for<br>
completion.<br>

Mountrail County<br>
Well File # 29489<br>
Dear Ray:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 22758, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft5">200' setback </span><span class="ft4">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft5">500' setback </span><span class="ft4">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the<br>
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 20 &amp; 29, T155N-R93W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must<br>
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are<br>
conducted. STATOIL OIL &amp; GAS must contact NDIC Field Inspector Jason Hicks at 701-720-3523<br>
prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum<br>
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10019 S.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given<br>
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division,<br>
Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,<br>
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.<br>
and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours<br>
or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey<br>
contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.<br>
Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director<br>
may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is<br>
hereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing<br>
on the date the well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well<br>
records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall<br>
permit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or<br>
controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to<br>
have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect<br>
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time<br>
upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and<br>
shall be available only to the Commission and its staff.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft3">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

DRILLING PROGNOSIS<br>
1.<br>
Pressure Control Equipment<br>
Blowout preventer (BOP) and related equipment (BOPE) shall be installed, used,<br>
maintained and tested in manner necessary to assure well control. The BOP and<br>
related control equipment shall be suitable for operations in those areas which are<br>
subject to subfreezing conditions. The BOPE shall be based on known or anticipated<br>
sub-surface pressures, geologic conditions, accepted engineering practice and surface<br>
environment. The working pressure of all BOPE shall exceed the anticipated surface<br>
pressure to which it may be subjected, assuming a partially evacuated hole with a<br>
pressure gradient of 0.22 psi/ft. A well control device shall be installed at the surface<br>
that is capable of complete closure of the wellbore. This device shall be closed<br>
whenever the well is unattended. If repair or replacement of the BOPE is required<br>
after testing, this work shall be performed prior to drilling out the casing shoe. When<br>
the BOPE cannot function to secure the hole, the hole shall be secured using cement,<br>
retrievable packer, bridge plug packer, bridge plug, or other acceptable approved<br>
method to assure safe well conditions. A schematic of the proposed pressure control<br>
equipment is attached.<br>
a.Type: Eleven (11) inch double gate hydraulic BOP with eleven (11) inch annular<br>
preventer. The blow-out preventer will be equipped as follows:<br>
i. Annular preventer.<br>
ii. Two sets of pipe rams, and a blind ram.<br>
iii. Drilling spool with two (2) side outlets (choke side shall be a 3-<br>
inch minimum, kill side shall be at least 3-inch diameter).<br>
iv. 3 inch diameter choke line.<br>
v. 2 choke line valves (3 inch minimum).<br>
vi. Kill line (3 inch minimum).<br>
vii. 2 chokes with 1 remotely controlled from rig floor (diagram<br>
attached).<br>
viii. 2 kill line valves and a check valve (2 inch minimum).<br>
ix. Upper kelly cock valve with handle available.<br>
x. When the expected pressures approach working pressure of the<br>
system, 1 remote kill line tested to stack pressure (which shall run<br>
to the outer edge of the substructure and be unobstructed).<br>
xi. Lower kelly cock valve with handle available.<br>
xii. Safety valve &amp; subs to fit all drill string connections in use.<br>
<hr>
<A name=61></a>xiii. Inside BOP or float sub available.<br>
xiv. Pressure gauge on choke manifold.<br>
xv. All BOPE connections subjected to well pressure shall be flanged,<br>
welded or clamped.<br>
xvi. Fill-up line above the uppermost preventer.<br>
b. Anticipated Bottom Hole Pressure: 5,400 psi<br>
c. Anticipated Bottom Hole Temperature: 240º Fahrenheit<br>
d. Testing Procedure:<br>
Annular Preventer<br>
At a minimum, the Annular Preventer will be pressure tested to 70% of the rated<br>
working pressure for a period of ten (10) minutes or until provisions of the test are<br>
met, whichever is longer. At a minimum, the above pressure test will be<br>
performed:<br>
1. When the annular preventer is initially installed;<br>
2. Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken;<br>
3. Following related repairs; and<br>
4. At thirty (21) day intervals.<br>
In addition, the annular preventer will be functionally operated at least weekly.<br>
Blow-Out Preventer<br>
At a minimum, the BOP, choke manifold, and related equipment will be high<br>
pressure tested to MASP or to the approved working pressure of the BOP<br>
stack/wellhead (if isolated from the surface casing by a test plug) or to 80% of the<br>
internal yield strength of the surface casing (if the BOP is not isolated from the<br>
surface casing by a test plug) and low pressure tested to 250 psi. Pressure will be<br>
maintained for a period of at least ten (10) minutes or until the requirements of the<br>
test are met, whichever is longer. At a minimum, the above pressure test will be<br>
performed:<br>
1. When the BOP is initially installed;<br>
2. Whenever any seal subject to test pressure is broken;<br>
3. Following related repairs; and<br>
4. At thirty (21) day intervals.<br>
In addition, the pipe and blind rams will be activated each trip, but not more than<br>
once each day. All BOP drills and tests will be recorded in the IADC driller's<br>
log.<br>
e. Choke Manifold Equipment:<br>
All choke lines will be straight lines unless turns use tee blocks or are targeted with<br>
running tees, and will be anchored to prevent whip and vibration. All valves (except<br>
chokes) in the kill line choke manifold and choke line shall be a type that does not<br>
restrict the flow (full opening) and that allows a straight through flow. Pressure<br>
gauges in the well control system shall be a type designed for drilling fluid service.<br>
<hr>
<A name=62></a>f.<br>
Accumulator:<br>
The accumulator will have sufficient capacity to open the hydraulically-controlled<br>
choke line valve (if so equipped), close all rams plus the annular preventer, and retain a<br>
minimum of 200 psi above pre-charge on the closing manifold without the use of the<br>
closing unit pumps. The fluid reservoir capacity will be double the usable fluid volume<br>
of the accumulator system capacity and the fluid level of the reservoir will be<br>
maintained at the manufacturer's recommendations.<br>
The BOP system will have two (2) independent power sources to close the preventers.<br>
Nitrogen bottles (3 minimum) will be one of these independent power sources and<br>
will maintain a charge equal to the manufacturer's specifications. The accumulator<br>
pre-charge pressure test will be conducted prior to connecting the closing unit to the<br>
BOP stack and at least once every six (6) months thereafter. The accumulator<br>
pressure will be corrected if the measured pre-charge pressure is found to be above or<br>
below the maximum or minimum limits.<br>
A manual locking device (i.e., hand wheels) or automatic locking device will be<br>
installed on all systems of 2M or greater. A valve will be installed in the closing line<br>
as close as possible to the annular preventer to act as a locking device. This valve<br>
will be maintained in the open position and will be closed only when the power<br>
source for the accumulator system is inoperative.<br>
Remote controls shall be readily accessible to the driller. Remote controls for all 3M<br>
or greater systems will be capable of closing all preventers. Remote controls for 5M<br>
or greater systems will be capable of both opening and closing all preventers. Master<br>
controls will be at the accumulator and will be capable of opening and closing all<br>
preventers and choke line valve (if so equipped).<br>
g. Miscellaneous Information:<br>
The choke manifold and BOP extension rods with hand wheels will be located<br>
outside the rig sub-structure. The hydraulic BOP closing unit will be located at least<br>
twenty-five (25) feet from the well head but readily accessible to the driller. Exact<br>
locations and configurations of the hydraulic BOP closing unit will depend upon the<br>
particular rig contracted to drill this hole. A flare line will be installed after the choke<br>
manifold extending 125 feet (minimum) form the center of the drill hole to a separate<br>
flare pit.<br>

Proposed Casing and Cementing Program<br>
Statoil Oil &amp; Gas LP (Statoil) proposes to drill a vertical hole in NE¼ NW¼ (340' FNL<br>
&amp; 2,405' FWL) of Section 20 in Township 155 North, Range 93 West to an approximate<br>
TVD of 10,005' at which time directional drilling operations will be initiated on an<br>
azimuth direction of 152.5º until a 90º angle has been achieved at a TVD of 10,482' (MD<br>
approximately 10,758'). Statoil will then commence with the drilling of a 9,495' (+/-)<br>
lateral horizontal reach in the Middle Bakken formation on a build rate of 2º/100' until<br>
the azimuth direction has reached 180º. Statoil will continue to drill in the lateral until a<br>
<hr>
<A name=63></a>measured depth of approximately 20,253' (TVD approximately 10,482') has been<br>
reached at a target bottom hole footage of approximately 250' FSL and 2,339' FEL<br>
(SW¼ SE¼ of Section 29, Township 155 North, Range 93 West. At total depth, the<br>
bottom hole will be located approximately 9,970' south and 543' east of the surface hole<br>
location.<br>

The surface casing will have centralizers on the bottom three (3) joints with a minimum<br>
of one (1) centralizer per joint starting with the shoe joint. The estimated top of cement<br>
for the intermediate casing string will be set at approximately 3,800' MD. Statoil will<br>
install one (1) solid centralizer or stand-off band every other joint thru the curve and<br>
one (1) per joint thru the first salt formation top that is encountered in the vertical<br>
portion of the wellbore to centralize the intermediate casing string.<br>

Horizontal Production Liner - The lateral liner will be uncemented.<br>
Please refer to the casing program attached within drilling plan for additional specifics<br>
regarding cement yields and additional additives. The above cement volumes are<br>
approximate and were calculated under the assumption that a gauge hole will be<br>
achieved. Actual cement volumes may vary due to variations in the actual hole gauge<br>
and will be determined by running a caliper log on the drilled hole. All waiting on cement<br>
(WOC) times will be adequate to achieve a minimum of 500 psi compressive strength at<br>
the casing shoe prior to drilling out.<br>

<A name=66></a>Surface Casing<br>
Burst Design: The surface casing is designed to withstand having the casing exposed full evacuation<br>
while drilling the 8 ¾" hole due to a kick; with a fracture gradient of 16.0ppg (verified through LOT), and<br>
no support by cement. At 2,200ft TVD the expected surface pressure is 1,830psi, the burst of the surface<br>
casing is 3,950psi. Therefore ADF = 2.158. During a 2000psi pressure test the casing is withstanding<br>
50.6% of its burst pressure yielding a burst ADF = 1.975.<br>
Collapse Design: The surface casing is designed to withstand full evacuation of the 8 ¾" hole with no<br>
support from cement. The shoe will break at 1,830psi (16ppg) yielding an ADF = 1.404.<br>
Tensile Design: The surface casing is designed to withstand 100,000lb over-pull while being run in<br>
8.33lb/gal freshwater. The buoyed weight with 100,000lb over-pull is 176,808lb yielding an ADF =<br>
2.545.<br>
Intermediate Casing<br>
Burst Design: Burst for the 7" intermediate casing is calculated twice, once for drilling operations, and<br>
again for completions operations. In the drilling phase the casing is designed to withstand being fully<br>
exposed to reservoir pressure (10.2ppg) while being fully evacuated to gas at 0.1psi/ft as the shoe is set<br>
inside the reservoir. This gives maximum expected pressure of 4,519psi at surface. With no external<br>
support the casing the minimum ADF = 2.755 for the 32lb/ft casing for drilling operations. During<br>
completions phase the 7" casing is exposed to a maximum casing test pressure of 9,000psi. For<br>
completions operations the minimum ADF = 1.383.<br>
Collapse Design: The 7" intermediate casing is designed to contain plastic deformation of salt formations<br>
in the last 1,500ft of the vertical hole. Overburden is assumed to be 1.0psi/ft TVD. Areas where the<br>
35lb/ft casing is run this formation goes to 9,750ft TVD, and in all other areas where the 32lb/ft is run this<br>
salt formation goes to 9,000ft TVD. Therefore the design factors for the 35lb/ft and 32lb/ft casings are<br>
ADF = 1.198 and 1.336 respectively.<br>
Tensile Design: The intermediate casing is designed to withstand 100,000lb over-pull while being run in<br>
9.8ppg mud. The buoyed weight of 11,000ft (10,500ft TVD) of 32lb/ft casing with 100,000lb over-pull is<br>
399,334lb yielding a minimum of ADF = 2.243.<br>
Production Liner<br>
Burst Design: The 11.6 and 13.5 lb/ft liner is designed to operate below 80% burst rating during the<br>
completions phase pressure test of 9,000psi. The 11.6 is run in the Bakken laterals and is specifically<br>
ordered to have a minimum yield strength of 125ksi in the P-110 grade and the 13.5 is run in the Three<br>
Forks laterals. At 9,000psi the 11.6 is operating at 74% of Burst or ADF = 1.35 and the 13.5 is operating<br>
at 72% of Burst or ADF = 1.38.<br>
<hr>
<A name=67></a>Collapse Design: Both liner weights are designed to sustan full evacuation while being exposed to a<br>
wellbore with 3,000ft TVD of 11.7lb/gal CaCl and 7,500ft of 10.2lb/gal saltwater, yielding a net pressure<br>
of 5,803psi. Under these conditions the 11.6 ADF = 1.526 and the 13.5 ADF = 1.842.<br>
Tensile Design: Both liner weights are designed to withstand 100,000lb of over-pull while being run in<br>
9.6lb/gal saltwater. The buoyed weitght of 11,000ft of 11.6 liner with 100,000lb over-pull is 208,898lb<br>
yielding ADF = 2.011; and the 13.5 ADF = 1.861.<br>
Centralization &amp; Cementing Program<br>
Surface Casing: The surface casing will have three centralizers on the bottom three joints, then one every<br>
three joints back to surface. Cement top will be at surface and topped-off if the cement should drop.<br>
Surface cement is approx. 367sx of lead cement at 11.5ppg and 2.9ft</span><span class="ft4">3 </span><span class="ft1">/sx, and 284sx of tail cement at<br>
15.8ppg and 1.16 ft</span><span class="ft4">3 </span><span class="ft1">/sx.<br>
Intermediate Casing: Intermediate casing will have one stand-off band every joint through the curve,<br>
then one centralizer every three joints into the salts, then one every joint 100ft+/- the salt formations, then<br>
one every joint to 1,500ft below the surface shoe. The cement top is designed to be 1,500ft below the<br>
surface shoe. Pipe rotation and reciprocation during cement displacement is standard practice.<br>
Intermediate cement is approx. 284sx of cement at 11.8ppg and 2.21 ft</span><span class="ft4">3 </span><span class="ft1">/sx; 527sx of cement at 15.8ppg<br>
and 1.54 ft</span><span class="ft4">3 </span><span class="ft1">/sx. Tail cement is designed to cover the salt formations.<br>
Production Casing: Currently (1Q2014) standard practice is un-cemented liner with swell packers.<br>
However we are moving to cemented liners. A cemented liner will have one solid body 5.75"OD<br>
centralizer per joint throughout the lateral. Cement will be a 15.8ppg circulated to the liner top. Pipe<br>
rotation will be standard practice.<br>

Gas Capture Plan for the Bures 20-29 Unit<br>
&amp;<br>
Charlie Sorenson 17-8 Unit<br>
Statoil Oil &amp; Gas LP ("Statoil") hereby submits the gas capture plan (the "Plan") in<br>
connection with its Application for Permit to Drill the Bakken and Three Forks formations<br>
covered by the Bures 20-29 &amp; Charlie Sorenson 17-8 units (the "Units"). The Plan is based on a<br>
multi-well startup that includes an eight-well drillout program, three days at initial production<br>
with one day allocated for rig up/down per well. The Plan fulfills the requirements set forth in<br>
the letter dated May 8, 2014 from Todd Holweger, DMR Permit Manager, to Bakken Operators,<br>
a copy of which is hereby attached as Exhibit A. The item numbers below refer to Mr.<br>
Holweger's letter.<br>
Item 1. Attached as Exhibit B is an affidavit from a company representative indicating<br>
the name of the gas gatherer Statoil met with and confirming that Statoil supplied the gas<br>
gatherer with the anticipated completion date of the wells and the anticipated production rates of<br>
the wells.<br>
Item 2. Attached as Exhibit C are detailed maps depicting (a) the name and location of<br>
the destination processing plant, (b) the name of the gas gatherer and location of lines for each<br>
gas gatherer in the map vicinity and (c) the proposed route and tie-in point to connect the subject<br>
well to an existing gas line.<br>
Item 3. Information on the existing line, to which Statoil proposes to connect, is as<br>
follows:<br>
(a) The maximum current daily capacity of the existing gas line is approximately 4.2<br>
MMCFD.<br>
(b) The current throughput of the existing gas line is approximately 1.6 MMCFD.<br>
(c) The anticipated daily capacity of existing gas line at date of first gas sales is 9 MMCFD,<br>
assuming installation of Manitou Compressor.<br>
(d) The anticipated throughput of existing gas line at date of first gas sales is approximately 9<br>
MMCFD, including the 6.6 MMCFD of the Bures &amp; Charlie Sorenson units.<br>
(e) Gas gatherer issues or expansion plans for the area (if known). Additional screw<br>
compression at Manitou and Arvid Anderson sites will generate an additional 8 MMCFD<br>
of take-away capacity.<br>
The foregoing information are estimates provided by Statoil based on current available data.<br>
<hr>
<A name=84></a>  <br>
Item 4. Statoil's flowback strategy for the Unit is the following:<br>
(a) The anticipated date of first production is anticipated to occur between April 1, 2015 and<br>
June 30, 2015.<br>
(b) The anticipated initial production rate is estimated to be between 2,000 and 2,500<br>
MMCFD per well, with a duration of between 30 and 40 days for all eight wells planned<br>
for the Units. After flowback, all eight wells will be brought on production with an<br>
anticipated maximum rate of production between 6,000 and 7,000 MMCFD.<br>
Item 5. Statoil is currently flaring the following amounts of gas:<br>
(a) Statoil's statewide percentage of gas flared for existing wells producing from the Bakken<br>
petroleum system is 35%.<br>
(b) Statoil's Alger fieldwide percentage of gas flared is 50%.<br>
Item 6. Statoil is anticipating that the Bures 20-29 &amp; Charlie Sorenson 17-8 Units will be<br>
connected to gas sales, therefore, alternatives to flaring are not needed at this time.<br>

RE:    GAS CAPTURE PLANS REQUIRED ON ALL APD'S <br>
  <br>
Dear Operator: <br>
This  letter  is  to  facilitate  understanding  by  operators  that  all  Applications  for  a  Permit  to  Drill  (APD) <br>
submitted to the NDIC Oil &amp; Gas Division, received after May 31, 2014, must be accompanied by a Gas <br>
Capture Plan (GCP).   The plan is part of the North Dakota Industrial Commission's newlyadopted policy <br>
on reducing gas flaring.   This requirement is for all wells which will be drilled to the Bakken, Three Forks, <br>
Three Forks/Bakken or Sanish Pools.   The GCP must accompany all APD permit renewals.    <br>
The gas capture plan must contain the following information: <br>
1. An affidavit signed by a company representative indicating: <br>
a. The name of the gas gatherer(s) the company met with. <br>
b. That the company supplied the gas gatherer(s) with the following information: <br>
i. Anticipated completion date of well(s). <br>
ii. Anticipated production rates of well(s). <br>
2. A detailed gas gathering pipeline system location map which depicts the following information.   <br>
a. Name and location of the destination processing plant. <br>
b. Name of gas gatherer and location of lines for each gas gatherer in the map vicinity. <br>
c. The proposed route and tiein point to connect the subject well to an existing gas line. <br>
3. Information on the existing line, to which operator proposes to connect to, including: <br>
a. Maximum current daily capacity of the existing gas line. <br>
b. Current throughput of the existing gas line. <br>
c. Anticipated daily capacity of existing gas line at date of first gas sales. <br>
d. Anticipated throughput of existing gas line at date of first gas sales. <br>
e. Gas gatherer issues or expansion plans for the area (if known). <br>
4. A detailed flowback strategy including: <br>
a. Anticipated date of first production. <br>
b. Anticipated oil and gas rates and duration.  If well is on a multiwell pad, include total <br>
for all wells being completed. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<hr>
<A name=87></a>5. Amount of gas applicant is currently flaring:  <br>
a. Statewide percentage of gas flared (total gas flared/total gas produced) for existing <br>
wells producing from the Bakken petroleum system.  Note industry target goals are to <br>
reduce flaring to 26% by 9114, 23% by 1115, 15% by 1116, and 10% by 9120. <br>
b. Fieldwide percentage of gas flared. <br>
6. Alternatives to flaring. <br>
a. Explain specific alternate systems available for consideration. <br>
b. Detail expected flaring reductions if such plans are implemented. <br>
 <br>
Permit consideration may be delayed or stipulations may be imposed (such as production restrictions) if <br>
applicant is unable to timely connect the subject well and alternatives to reduce the amount of flared <br>
gas will not be implemented. <br>
The NDIC believes a concerted effort by operators in North Dakota is necessary to reduce the volume of <br>
flared  gas,  reduce  the  number  of  wells  flaring,  and  reduce  duration  of  flaring  of  wells,  which  will <br>
ultimately meet our goal to encourage and promote the development, production, and utilization of oil <br>
and  gas  in  the  state  in  such  a  manner  as  will  prevent  waste,  maximize  economic  recovery,  and  fully <br>
protect  the  correlative  rights  of  all  owners  to  the  end  that  the  landowners,  the  royalty  owners,  the <br>
producers, and the general public realize the greatest possible good from these vital natural resources. <br>
 Should you require additional information, feel free to contact our office. <br>
Sincerely, <br>

<A name=4></a>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br>
RUUD 5493 41-23 4T3 is a North lateral Three Forks 3</span><span class="ft5">rd </span><span class="ft4">Bench well with a surface<br>
location of 235' FSL- 455' FWL T154N R93W Sec 23, Mountrail County, North Dakota.<br>
The primary pay zone extended from 9.5' to 32.5' below the top of the Three Forks 3</span><span class="ft5">rd<br>
Bench. This pay zone was picked due its drilling properties, its reliable gamma markers,<br>
and for its production potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to steer<br>
the well within the defined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state.<br>
Directional and MWD services were performed by Pathfinder/Schlumberger. Chris<br>
Haynes and Austin Wiitanen were the well site geologists providing geo-steering and<br>
mud logging services. In the vertical portion of the well Chris Haynes, and Austin<br>
Wiitanen provided logging services, and steering through the curve, all from Columbine<br>
Logging, Inc.<br>

2.1 Well site Geology </span><span class="ft4">(Columbine Logging, Inc.)<br>
Geological consulting and mud logging, for the vertical, started on 12/10/2014 and ran<br>
until 12/30/2014. Services provided included; Morning reports, Afternoon reports,<br>
Evening reports, Midnight reports, Sample examination, Production of lithographic logs,<br>
Geo steering, Sample collection, sample mailing, and a final end of well report.<br>
2.1.1 Geosteering<br>
Columbine Logging arrived on location and rigged up for vertical drilling operations to<br>
provide mud logging and geosteering throughout the curve and lateral. Our primary<br>
offset GR TVD logs were from the RUUD 5493 42-23H well, located in 154N 93W 23<br>
SE SW Mountrail County ND. From this offset log a target zone of 23' was determined<br>
to be 9.5' to 32.5' below the top of the Three Forks 3</span><span class="ft7">rd </span><span class="ft3">Bench. Within the lateral, the<br>
primary objective was to drill within the "TVD drilling window" defined by the 23 foot<br>
section identified above. Gamma markers were well defined throughout most of the well.<br>
An expected gamma cross section was provided by Nathan Gabelman from Oasis<br>
Petroleum and can be seen as appendix B.<br>
The primary markers targeted were bracketed by the B and C markers. This<br>
target was identified in gamma as a localized high of 95api to 105 api. This area was<br>
bracketed above by a low of approximately 65-70api, identified as being the lower extent<br>
of the B marker. Below the target is also bracketed by a localized low identified as being<br>
the center of the target window and the upper extent of marker C. The values of this<br>
localized low ranged from 65-75api. Below the C marker was a low associated identified<br>
as marker D. This low could range from 50-60api. The bracketing of low values above<br>
and below the moderately high target area, made the target window fairly easily<br>
distinguishable. Throughout the lateral there was very little difference in samples. The<br>
major differences in lithology seen were: a shift from an argillaceous red silt stone to an<br>
arenaceous white to buff siltstone. This difference was often associated with slight<br>
differences in percentage of the light green shale seen throughout the lateral, and the<br>
occasional appearance of trace amounts of pyrite. The upper portion of the window had a<br>
much higher level of cementation experience between the silt grains. This area was<br>
identified as being white to grey with occasional brown grains cemented in a possibly<br>
dolomitic to calcareous matrix. These slight differences in lithology were used to help<br>
correlate the location within the target window but were not distinct enough to specify<br>
exact location alone. Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating dip from<br>
relevant gamma markers, as well as by using lithology, and ROP to determine our<br>
position within the formation. The well reached its total depth (TD) approximately 2 feet<br>
above the center of the "TVD drilling window".<br>
2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys<br>
4<br>
<hr>
<A name=6></a>Gamma and survey MWD services were provided by Pathfinder. The gamma ray peaked<br>
at the upper extent of the A gamma marker at the very top of the Three Forks 3</span><span class="ft2">rd </span><span class="ft1">Bench<br>
Bed. This gamma was approximately 120api and roughly 3 feet above the target<br>
window. The highest consistent gamma recoded throughout the lateral was<br>
approximately 900api. These values were associated with the localized peaks identified<br>
as being the B and C markers. The lowest consistent gamma was located just above the<br>
bottom of the target window, and was associated with the D marker and had an average<br>
of 55api. While drilling in the "TVD drilling window" gamma fluctuated primarily<br>
between 60 and 90 API.<br>

2.2 Mud Logging (</span><span class="ft8">Columbine Logging, Inc.)<br>
2.2.1 Sample Examination<br>
Samples were collected by Columbine Logging every 30 feet from 7900' TVD in the<br>
vertical to 7" casing point at 11,167'MD and 10,745 TVD. While drilling the lateral,<br>
Columbine Logging collected samples every 30 feet, when possible, and 60 ft when ROP<br>
was above 150 feet per hour. Sample descriptions included; Lithology, color, firmness,<br>
grain size, structure, texture, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. Hydrocarbon<br>
fluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV lamp. The ratings are based<br>
on 7 descriptors: none, slight trace, trace, fair, moderate, good, and Excellent. The<br>
descriptor used is based on the loggers' observations and best judgment of brilliance,<br>
color and longevity of the cut. Acetone was used as a cutting agent.<br>
2.2.2 Gas Detection<br>
Gas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas chromatograph system. The gas detection<br>
system uses an infra-red detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates<br>
and measures gases C1 (methane), C2 (ethane), C3 (propane), iC4 (iso-butane) and nC4<br>
(normal butane). Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit equals 100 ppm. The gas<br>
detection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, IC4, NC4, H2S, O2 and CO</span><span class="ft2">2, </span><span class="ft1">but only C1<br>
through a total value of C4 (iC4+nC4) were logged.<br>
The Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system uses digital signal processing<br>
techniques and non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection. The<br>
5<br>
<hr>
<A name=7></a>system uses a proprietary chromatograph. This chromatograph has the capability to<br>
detect from 0 to 10,000 gas units. This translates as 0 to 100% typical naturally-<br>
occurring hydrocarbon gas mixtures. Calibration is performed using National Institute of<br>
Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable calibration gases. Lab calibration points<br>
include 0%, 2.5%, and 100% pure methane. Complete immunity to saturation or damage<br>
in the presence of high concentrations of both light and heavy hydrocarbon gases<br>
precludes the necessity of constant re-calibration or zero referencing. This allows the<br>
Bloodhound to react to hydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration<br>
without dilution.<br>
Lag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump<br>
output, open hole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and<br>
bottom hole assembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations<br>
and adjust lag time when needed.<br>

4.0 Gas Shows<br>
There was very little gas experienced throughout the lateral until 14,000 MD. From the<br>
shoe (11,167'MD) to approximately 14,000'MD the average gas experienced was 274u.<br>
The average gas value recorded from 14,000'MD to TD was 1759u with a maximum gas<br>
value of 2888u associated with the MWD trip at 16,967' MD. The drastic change in gas<br>
values was not generally associated with any major lithographic changes. The vast<br>
majority of gas recorded was C1 and C2. The best Butane or C4 gas values were<br>
associated with footages from approximately 16,000' MD to 18,500' MD.<br>

<A name=10></a>4.1 Oil Shows<br>
Invert was used as a drilling fluid during the vertical and curve sections of the well. The<br>
use of invert makes oil show calculations impossible during these sections. Oil was<br>
minimally present throughout most of the lateral. Fluorescence in the cuttings was<br>
described as: Dull yellow to occasionally bright yellow hydrocarbon fluorescence and<br>
ranged from scattered to consistent. The overall oil show was rated on 7 descriptors:<br>
none, slight trace, trace, fair, moderate, good, and Excellent. The descriptor used, are<br>
based on the loggers' observations and best judgment of brilliance, color and longevity of<br>
the cut. The descriptors used to describe the speed of the cut range from very slow to<br>
fast. Color descriptors are just that, the color observed by the logger. During the lateral<br>
the speed ranged from no cut, to very slow, and color was very dull milky blue-white.<br>
The overall ratings observed in the lateral ranged from no cut to fast very light blue-ish<br>
white cut. Oil was never visible in the possum belly and on the shakers. Acetone was<br>
used as a cutting solvent. There were a few points were the directional team required<br>
enough lube in the mud that discerning fluorescence and cut from oil verses lube became<br>
impossible to accomplish accurately. So intermittently throughout the lateral there are<br>
samples were no oil shows were recorded.<br>

The surface location of RUUD 5493 41-23 4T3 is 235' FSL- 455' FWL T154N<br>
R93W Sec 23, Mountrail County, North Dakota. The ground elevation is 2278' and KB<br>
elevation was 2303', referenced to the Kelly bushing of Ensign 158. The curve was<br>
landed roughly 2.5 feet below the center of the target window, at 11,167'MD; 10,745'<br>
TVD, within the Three Forks 3</span><span class="ft3">rd </span><span class="ft2">Bench Formation.<br>
From the 7" shoe to TD the gamma markers throughout the formation had a fairly<br>
consistent pattern. The primary marker targeted was the low gamma (approximately 60-<br>
70api) found between the B and C markers. This target was identified in gamma as a<br>
localized low in values, bracketed above by a moderate high of approximately 90-100api,<br>
known as marker B. Below the target is also bracketed by a moderately high values<br>
ranging from 95-105api. Directly below this area of high gamma is another low ranging<br>
from 60-70api and is considered the center of the drilling window. This low is also<br>
considered to be the upper edge of the C marker. Below the C marker is a low associated<br>
with the D marker. This low was the lowest values experienced within the lateral and<br>
could range 50-60api. The bracketing characteristics made the target window fairly<br>
easily distinguishable.<br>
The bit tended to climb throughout most of the well bore, with only a few<br>
exceptions. The bit only did fully exit the target window at 15,673'MD, and stayed out<br>
of the window till 16,066' MD.<br>
The total length of the lateral from shoe to TD was 9418 feet in length. We spent<br>
approximately 393 feet outside the window. The 393 feet outside the window accounted<br>
for 4.2 percent of the lateral being out of the window, and 95.8 percent within the<br>
window. A TD of 20,585' MD, 10,683.06 TVD, and location NWNW 280' FNL, 536.17'<br>

<A name=27></a>6.3 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION<br>
The RUUD 5493 41-23 4T3 is a single lateral Three Forks 3</span><span class="ft3">rd </span><span class="ft2">Bench well, spud on November 20,<br>
2014 from a surface location of 235' FSL- 455' FWL T154N R93W Sec 23, Mountrail County, North<br>
Dakota. The lateral was drilled to a total depth of 20,585' MD, 10,683.06' TVD,<br>
10044.89 VS, (projected) on December 30, 2014 with a projected bottom hole location of NWNW<br>
280' FNL &amp; 536.17' FEL Sec.14 T154N R93W, Mountrail County, ND, USA.<br>
The primary pay zone extended 23' was determined to be 9.5' to 32.5' below the top of the Three<br>
Forks 3</span><span class="ft3">rd </span><span class="ft2">Bench. Per the Geo prog provided by Oasis Petroleum the anticipated dip of the formation<br>
was 90.25 degrees, based on a subsurface structure map provided by Oasis Petroleum. Our primary<br>
offset was RUUD 5493 42-23H well, located in 154N 93W 23 SE SW Mountrail County ND.<br>
The formation had a fairly consistent dip rate that varied from 88.47 degrees at its lowest, (granted this<br>
was for a very short period and calculation could have been affected by local thinning of the<br>
formation) to a 91.15 at its steepest. Average experienced dip of the formation was 90.35 degrees<br>
which is greater than the expected dip of 90.25 degrees. The total average ROP throughout the entire<br>
lateral was approximately 111'/hr while drilling. This well was completed with 6 BHA's. The well<br>
reached TD at 20,585' MD, 10,683.06' TVD, 10,044.89 VS (projected) on December 30, 2014.<br>
Currently the well is awaiting completion.<br>

HORIZONTAL WELL<br>
RUUD 5493 41-23 4T3<br>
SWSW Section 23-154N-93W<br>
Mountrail County<br>
Well File # 29216<br>
Dear Brandi:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24825, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft3">200' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the<br>
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 14 &amp; 23 T154N R93W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must<br>
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are<br>
conducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Jason Hicks at 701-720-3523<br>
prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing<br>
point is: 45' east. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the<br>
well head is: 10125' north.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft1">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft4">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>
Assistant Director<br>

We expect to reduce the flared amount by ~30% by recovering 70  80% of the C3+.<br>

Brandi,<br>
This is in regards to the voicemail I left you. At the bottom of your GCP where your flaring<br>
alternatives are listed, it shows that you may install a temporary gas liquification unit, can you<br>
please add what percentage that would reduce your flaring if it was implemented? This can be<br>
found as item 6. b) on the GCP letter that was sent out. I attached both for your reference.<br>
Thank you very much,<br>

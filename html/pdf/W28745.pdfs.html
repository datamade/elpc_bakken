Well File # 28745<br>
Dear Michelle:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 21138, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200'<br>
setback </span><span class="ft1">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280 acre<br>
spacing unit consisting of Sections 1 &amp; 12, T155N-R100W. </span><span class="ft4">Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter<br>
sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site<br>
during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. STATOIL OIL &amp;<br>
GAS LP must take into consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when contemplating<br>
simultaneous operations on the above captioned location.<br>
Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety<br>
Regulation) "No boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to<br>
any producing well or oil tank." Placement as close as one hundred twenty-five feet [38.10 meters] may be<br>
allowed if a spark or flame arrestor is utilized on the equipment. STATOIL OIL &amp; GAS must contact NDIC<br>
Field Inspector Jessica Gilkey at 701-770-7340 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling<br>
and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent<br>
pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are<br>
prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill<br>
cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal<br>
coordinates from the well head are: 10005 S &amp; 935 W.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be<br>
waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to<br>
evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that<br>
would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the<br>
applicant should retain the permit.<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

Pressure Control Equipment<br>
Blowout preventer (BOP) and related equipment (BOPE) shall be installed, used,<br>
maintained and tested in manner necessary to assure well control. The BOP and<br>
related control equipment shall be suitable for operations in those areas which are<br>
subject to subfreezing conditions. The BOPE shall be based on known or anticipated<br>
sub-surface pressures, geologic conditions, accepted engineering practice and surface<br>
environment. The working pressure of all BOPE shall exceed the anticipated surface<br>
pressure to which it may be subjected, assuming a partially evacuated hole with a<br>
pressure gradient of 0.22 psi/ft. A well control device shall be installed at the surface<br>
that is capable of complete closure of the wellbore. This device shall be closed<br>
whenever the well is unattended. If repair or replacement of the BOPE is required<br>
after testing, this work shall be performed prior to drilling out the casing shoe. When<br>
the BOPE cannot function to secure the hole, the hole shall be secured using cement,<br>
retrievable packer, bridge plug packer, bridge plug, or other acceptable approved<br>
method to assure safe well conditions. A schematic of the proposed pressure control<br>
equipment is attached.<br>

3. Following related repairs; and<br>
4. At thirty (21) day intervals.<br>
In addition, the annular preventer will be functionally operated at least weekly.<br>
Blow-Out Preventer<br>
At a minimum, the BOP, choke manifold, and related equipment will be high<br>
pressure tested to MASP or to the approved working pressure of the BOP<br>
stack/wellhead (if isolated from the surface casing by a test plug) or to 80% of the<br>
internal yield strength of the surface casing (if the BOP is not isolated from the<br>
surface casing by a test plug) and low pressure tested to 250 psi. Pressure will be<br>
maintained for a period of at least ten (10) minutes or until the requirements of the<br>
test are met, whichever is longer. At a minimum, the above pressure test will be<br>
performed:<br>

The accumulator will have sufficient capacity to open the hydraulically-controlled<br>
choke line valve (if so equipped), close all rams plus the annular preventer, and retain a<br>
minimum of 200 psi above pre-charge on the closing manifold without the use of the<br>
closing unit pumps. The fluid reservoir capacity will be double the usable fluid volume<br>
of the accumulator system capacity and the fluid level of the reservoir will be<br>
maintained at the manufacturer's recommendations.<br>
The BOP system will have two (2) independent power sources to close the preventers.<br>
Nitrogen bottles (3 minimum) will be one of these independent power sources and<br>
will maintain a charge equal to the manufacturer's specifications. The accumulator<br>
pre-charge pressure test will be conducted prior to connecting the closing unit to the<br>
BOP stack and at least once every six (6) months thereafter. The accumulator<br>
pressure will be corrected if the measured pre-charge pressure is found to be above or<br>
below the maximum or minimum limits.<br>
A manual locking device (i.e., hand wheels) or automatic locking device will be<br>
installed on all systems of 2M or greater. A valve will be installed in the closing line<br>
as close as possible to the annular preventer to act as a locking device. This valve<br>
will be maintained in the open position and will be closed only when the power<br>
source for the accumulator system is inoperative.<br>
Remote controls shall be readily accessible to the driller. Remote controls for all 3M<br>
or greater systems will be capable of closing all preventers. Remote controls for 5M<br>
or greater systems will be capable of both opening and closing all preventers. Master<br>
controls will be at the accumulator and will be capable of opening and closing all<br>
preventers and choke line valve (if so equipped).<br>
g. Miscellaneous Information:<br>
The choke manifold and BOP extension rods with hand wheels will be located<br>
outside the rig sub-structure. The hydraulic BOP closing unit will be located at least<br>
twenty-five (25) feet from the well head but readily accessible to the driller. Exact<br>
locations and configurations of the hydraulic BOP closing unit will depend upon the<br>
particular rig contracted to drill this hole. A flare line will be installed after the choke<br>
manifold extending 125 feet (minimum) form the center of the drill hole to a separate<br>
flare pit.<br>

Proposed Casing and Cementing Program<br>
Statoil Oil &amp; Gas LP (Statoil) proposes to drill a vertical hole in Lot 3 (320' FNL &amp;<br>
1,435' FWL) of Section 1 in Township 155 North, Range 100 West to an approximate<br>
TVD of 10,352' at which time directional drilling operations will be initiated on an<br>
azimuth direction of 213.1º until a 90º angle has been achieved at a TVD of 10,816' (MD<br>
approximately 11,102'). Statoil will then commence with the drilling of a 9,800' (+/-)<br>
lateral horizontal reach in the Middle Bakken formation on a build rate of 2º/100' until<br>
<hr>
<A name=19></a>the azimuth direction has reached 180º. Statoil will continue to drill in the lateral until a<br>
measured depth of approximately 20,903' (TVD approximately 10,816') has been<br>
reached at a target bottom hole footage of approximately 250' FSL and 540' FWL<br>
(SW1/4 SW1/4 of Section 12, Township 155 North, Range 100 West. At total depth, the<br>
bottom hole will be located approximately 9,960' south and 877' west of the surface hole<br>
location.<br>

Horizontal Production Liner - The lateral liner will be uncemented.<br>
Please refer to the casing program attached within drilling plan for additional specifics<br>
regarding cement yields and additional additives. The above cement volumes are<br>
approximate and were calculated under the assumption that a gauge hole will be<br>
achieved. Actual cement volumes may vary due to variations in the actual hole gauge<br>
and will be determined by running a caliper log on the drilled hole. All waiting on cement<br>
(WOC) times will be adequate to achieve a minimum of 500 psi compressive strength at<br>
the casing shoe prior to drilling out.<br>

<A name=22></a>Surface Casing<br>
Burst Design: The surface casing is designed to withstand having the casing exposed full evacuation<br>
while drilling the 8 ¾" hole due to a kick; with a fracture gradient of 16.0ppg (verified through LOT), and<br>
no support by cement. At 2,200ft TVD the expected surface pressure is 1,830psi, the burst of the surface<br>
casing is 3,950psi. Therefore ADF = 2.158. During a 2000psi pressure test the casing is withstanding<br>
50.6% of its burst pressure yielding a burst ADF = 1.975.<br>
Collapse Design: The surface casing is designed to withstand full evacuation of the 8 ¾" hole with no<br>
support from cement. The shoe will break at 1,830psi (16ppg) yielding an ADF = 1.404.<br>
Tensile Design: The surface casing is designed to withstand 100,000lb over-pull while being run in<br>
8.33lb/gal freshwater. The buoyed weight with 100,000lb over-pull is 176,808lb yielding an ADF =<br>
2.545.<br>
Intermediate Casing<br>
Burst Design: Burst for the 7" intermediate casing is calculated twice, once for drilling operations, and<br>
again for completions operations. In the drilling phase the casing is designed to withstand being fully<br>
exposed to reservoir pressure (10.2ppg) while being fully evacuated to gas at 0.1psi/ft as the shoe is set<br>
inside the reservoir. This gives maximum expected pressure of 4,519psi at surface. With no external<br>
support the casing the minimum ADF = 2.755 for the 32lb/ft casing for drilling operations. During<br>
completions phase the 7" casing is exposed to a maximum casing test pressure of 9,000psi. For<br>
completions operations the minimum ADF = 1.383.<br>
Collapse Design: The 7" intermediate casing is designed to contain plastic deformation of salt formations<br>
in the last 1,500ft of the vertical hole. Overburden is assumed to be 1.0psi/ft TVD. Areas where the<br>
35lb/ft casing is run this formation goes to 9,750ft TVD, and in all other areas where the 32lb/ft is run this<br>
salt formation goes to 9,000ft TVD. Therefore the design factors for the 35lb/ft and 32lb/ft casings are<br>
ADF = 1.198 and 1.336 respectively.<br>
Tensile Design: The intermediate casing is designed to withstand 100,000lb over-pull while being run in<br>
9.8ppg mud. The buoyed weight of 11,000ft (10,500ft TVD) of 32lb/ft casing with 100,000lb over-pull is<br>
399,334lb yielding a minimum of ADF = 2.243.<br>
Production Liner<br>
Burst Design: The 11.6 and 13.5 lb/ft liner is designed to operate below 80% burst rating during the<br>
completions phase pressure test of 9,000psi. The 11.6 is run in the Bakken laterals and is specifically<br>
ordered to have a minimum yield strength of 125ksi in the P-110 grade and the 13.5 is run in the Three<br>
Forks laterals. At 9,000psi the 11.6 is operating at 74% of Burst or ADF = 1.35 and the 13.5 is operating<br>
at 72% of Burst or ADF = 1.38.<br>
<hr>
<A name=23></a>Collapse Design: Both liner weights are designed to sustan full evacuation while being exposed to a<br>
wellbore with 3,000ft TVD of 11.7lb/gal CaCl and 7,500ft of 10.2lb/gal saltwater, yielding a net pressure<br>
of 5,803psi. Under these conditions the 11.6 ADF = 1.526 and the 13.5 ADF = 1.842.<br>
Tensile Design: Both liner weights are designed to withstand 100,000lb of over-pull while being run in<br>
9.6lb/gal saltwater. The buoyed weitght of 11,000ft of 11.6 liner with 100,000lb over-pull is 208,898lb<br>
yielding ADF = 2.011; and the 13.5 ADF = 1.861.<br>
Centralization &amp; Cementing Program<br>
Surface Casing: The surface casing will have three centralizers on the bottom three joints, then one every<br>
three joints back to surface. Cement top will be at surface and topped-off if the cement should drop.<br>
Surface cement is approx. 367sx of lead cement at 11.5ppg and 2.9ft</span><span class="ft4">3 </span><span class="ft1">/sx, and 284sx of tail cement at<br>
15.8ppg and 1.16 ft</span><span class="ft4">3 </span><span class="ft1">/sx.<br>
Intermediate Casing: Intermediate casing will have one stand-off band every joint through the curve,<br>
then one centralizer every three joints into the salts, then one every joint 100ft+/- the salt formations, then<br>
one every joint to 1,500ft below the surface shoe. The cement top is designed to be 1,500ft below the<br>
surface shoe. Pipe rotation and reciprocation during cement displacement is standard practice.<br>
Intermediate cement is approx. 284sx of cement at 11.8ppg and 2.21 ft</span><span class="ft4">3 </span><span class="ft1">/sx; 527sx of cement at 15.8ppg<br>
and 1.54 ft</span><span class="ft4">3 </span><span class="ft1">/sx. Tail cement is designed to cover the salt formations.<br>
Production Casing: Currently (1Q2014) standard practice is un-cemented liner with swell packers.<br>
However we are moving to cemented liners. A cemented liner will have one solid body 5.75"OD<br>
centralizer per joint throughout the lateral. Cement will be a 15.8ppg circulated to the liner top. Pipe<br>
rotation will be standard practice.<br>

Well File # 29714<br>
Dear Heidi:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 25079, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft2">1220' setback </span><span class="ft0">(per Commission policy) from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft2">200' setback </span><span class="ft0">from the east &amp;<br>
west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of the S/2 of Section 36, T150N R92W, the S/2 of<br>
Section 31,T150N R91W, the N/2 of Section 1, T149N R92W and the N/2 of Section 6, T149N R91W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to Lake Sakakawea adjacent to the well site, a dike is required<br>
surrounding the entire location.<br>
Automatic shut offs required on well head and high/low tank<br>
indicators. In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be<br>
provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to drilling the well(s) into an<br>
offsite spacing unit. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock<br>
disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site<br>
during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. QEP<br>
ENERGY CO must contact NDIC Field Inspector Allen Christensen at 701-989-9183 prior to location<br>
construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing<br>
point is: 1010 W. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the<br>
well head is: 11048 W.<br>

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft4">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>

1. Affidavit: Attached as a part of this gas capture plan.<br>
2. Detailed gas gathering pipeline system location map<br>
Arrow Pipeline, LLC ("ARRW")<br>
Name and Location of gas processing plant: </span><span class="ft3">Oneok Garden Creek Plant, Section 35-T151N-R98W<br>
Name of gas gatherer and location of lines for each gas gatherer in the vicinity: </span><span class="ft3">ARRW 8" steel gathering<br>
line; no other viable gatherers in the vicinity<br>
Proposed Route and Tie-in point for well connection: </span><span class="ft3">See above gathering system map<br>
3. Detailed information for Arrow Compressor Station #6:<br>
Maximum current daily capacity: </span><span class="ft3">Station 6 is not operational yet<br>
Current throughput: </span><span class="ft3">Approximately 6 MMcfd on that line<br>
<hr>
<A name=41></a>Anticipated daily capacity at date of first gas sales: </span><span class="ft1">Approximately 12 MMcfd<br>
Anticipated throughput at date of first gas sales: </span><span class="ft1">Approximately 10 MMcfd based on QEP production<br>
assumptions as well as other gas in the area<br>
Gas gatherer issues or expansion plans for the area: </span><span class="ft1">ARRW has and is projected to have adequate<br>
pipeline and compression capacity for QEP's current and forecasted gas; however, ARRW's high pipeline<br>
pressures have been the main culprit causing QEP to flare gas in 2014, and these high line pressures<br>
have been caused by the lack of processing capacity by the downstream gas processer Oneok at their<br>
Garden Creek Plant. That plant is set to be expanded in August 2014 and should alleviate ARRW's high<br>
line pressure QEP has been experiencing in 2014.<br>
4. Detailed flowback strategy:<br>
Anticipated date of first production: </span><span class="ft1">2</span><span class="ft4">nd </span><span class="ft1">Quarter of 2015<br>
Anticipated oil and gas rates and duration (for all pad wells): </span><span class="ft1">See table below (assumes all pad first flows<br>
occur on the same day ­ in reality, some staggering will occur but that detail is not known at this time) .<br>

5. QEP flaring amounts:<br>
Statewide percentage of gas flared for existing wells in the Bakken petroleum system: </span><span class="ft1">53% for the most<br>
recent month of July 2014 (28.0 MMcfd flared /52.5 MMcfd produced)<br>
Field wide percentage of gas flared for this well: </span><span class="ft1">14% in the Heart Butte field for the most recent month<br>
of July 2014 (1.1 MMcfd flared/7.8 MMcfd produced)<br>
6. QEP Alternatives to flaring:<br>
Specific alternative systems available for consideration: </span><span class="ft1">When ARRW is at capacity or not connected,<br>
QEP has considered and implemented JT conditioning skids for its flaring wells. QEP has done this on 2<br>
pads in Sections 33-35 of T149N-R95W (vendor Montana-Dakota) in the Williston basin. QEP also is<br>
<hr>
<A name=42></a>looking at site usage for a number of applications to include powering wellhead equipment, drilling rigs,<br>
gas lift, etc. Further, QEP is installing gas-powered generators on our pads in the Heart Butte field (FBIR)<br>
instead of using diesel fuel (second half of 2014).<br>
Details of flaring reductions if such alternative plans are implemented: </span><span class="ft0">The site usage for gas powered<br>
generators and other usage on our Heart Butte pads was 22% (1.7 MMcfd) in July 2014, and that is gas<br>
that otherwise would have flared.<br>

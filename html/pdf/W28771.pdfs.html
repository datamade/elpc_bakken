INTRODUCTION<br>
XTO Energy, Inc. Ranger 21X-18E [NE NW Section 18, T151N, R99W] is located approximately 6<br>
miles north-northeast of Arnegard, in Tobacco Garden Field of McKenzie County, North Dakota (Figure<br>
1). The well is designed as a Three Forks horizontal well to develop Sections 18 and 19. Directional<br>
drilling and geo-steering will be employed to land in the Three Forks reservoir and maintain maximum<br>
exposure to a 20' target zone.<br>
GEOLOGY<br>
Methods<br>
Geologic analysis for the Ranger 21X-18E was provided by a Sunburst Consulting, Inc. geology team.<br>
Sunburst well site geologists caught lagged samples at 50' intervals from 2,235' to 5,000', then 100'<br>
intervals to 9,500' and at 30' intervals for the remainder of the well. Rock samples, rate of penetration<br>
and gamma ray data were used in geologic analysis to aid in geo-steering and dip calculations.<br>
Prospective Lithology<br>
The Niobrara Formation came in at 4,351' MD / 4,351 TVD, 4' low to Tobacco Garden 41-18SH. The<br>
Niobrara consists of light to dark gray shale which has an earthy texture and contains trace amounts of<br>
disseminated pyrite and bentonite. Background gas through this formation rose to a 400 units with a mud<br>
weight of 9.60 ppg.<br>
The Carlile Formation was logged at 4,507' MD / 4,507' TVD, 12' low to Tobacco Garden 41-18SH.<br>
This formation consists of medium to dark gray shale which has an earthy to waxy texture, bentonite was<br>
also seen with in the Carlile. A gas spike of 478 units was seen in the middle part of this formation<br>
against a 9.60 ppg mud weight.<br>
<hr>
<A name=10></a>The Greenhorn Formation was observed at 4,830' MD / 4,830' TVD, 30' low to prognosis and 5' low<br>
to the Tobacco Garden 41-18SH. The same light to dark gray shale was witnessed here also however the<br>
Greenhorn tended to contain more of the slightly darker shale. Bentonite was also seen in this formation.<br>
A gas spike of 540 units was seen at the top of the Greenhorn while drilling with the same 9.60 ppg mud<br>
weight.<br>
A section of silty sandstone in the center of the Piper Formation increased background gas to 289 units<br>
against a 9.90 ppg mud weight. This formation came in at 6,690' MD / 6,689' TVD, 1' low to Tobacco<br>
Garden 41-18SH. The Piper contains shale, limestone, siltstone, silty sandstone and also had a layer of<br>
anhydrite.<br>
The Tyler Formation was logged at 8,157' MD / 8,156' TVD, 4' high to prognosis and 8' high to<br>
Tobacco Garden 41-18SH. The lithology here was mostly light to medium gray shale which was sub-<br>
bulky with earthy texture and showed trace disseminated pyrite. The Tyler also had orange to brown<br>
siltstone. Two gas shows were witnessed in this formation, a 288 unit show and a 247 unit show shortly<br>
after, against a mud weight of 9.55 ppg.<br>
The Otter top came in at 8,374' MD / 8,373' TVD, 1' high to Tobacco Garden 41-18SH, the Otter<br>
consists of dark gray shale and off-white limestone mudstone. A gas show of 393 units was witnessed<br>
while drilling this formation with a mud weight of 9.60 ppg.<br>
The Mission Canyon Formation was drilled at 9,777' MD / 9,776' TVD, 7' low to prognosis and 17'<br>
high Tobacco Garden 41-18SH. The Mission Canyon consists primarily of clean, argillaceous and<br>
dolomitic limestone. The upper Mission Canyon is primarily friable to firm, light to medium gray<br>
argillaceous limestone. While the lower lithology consisted primarily of off white to medium gray<br>
microcrystalline limestone mudstone. Hydrocarbon shows ranged from 91 to 196 units in 9.70 to 9.85 ppg<br>
drilling mud.<br>
The argillaceous limestone signifying the top of the Lodgepole Formation was penetrated at 10,301'<br>
MD / 10,300' TVD which is 3' low to prognosis and 22' high to Tobacco Garden 41-18SH. This slope<br>
marine deposit consisted of mostly gray to brown argillaceous mudstone that was firm to hard,<br>
microcrystalline and contained rare disseminated pyrite. Also present were relatively thin beds of clean<br>
limestone that were light gray to brown, microcrystalline and had an earthy texture. Fracture gases ranged<br>
from 1,044 units to 4,290 units against 10.1 ppg drilling mud.<br>
The False Bakken shale was drilled at 11,175' MD / 11,094' TVD which was 11' low to prognosis and<br>
3' high to Tobacco Garden 41-18SH. This relatively thin lithology consists of medium to dark gray brown<br>
shale. A single gas show of 2,430 units was witnessed against a 10.15 ppg mud weight.<br>
The Bakken Formation has four members, two of which are organic-rich pyritic shale, separated by a<br>
silty sandstone middle member. The carbonaceous Upper Bakken Shale was penetrated at 11,192' MD /<br>
11,103' TVD, 4' low to prognosis and 5' high to Tobacco Garden 41-18SH. Gas shows through the shale<br>
read upwards of 2,173 units (C1 through C4) before penetrating the Middle Bakken at 11,229' MD /<br>
11,122' TVD, 5' low to prognosis and 1' high to Tobacco Garden 41-18SH. The Middle Member<br>
consisted of light gray to light brown silty sandstone. Background gas here dropped as low as 805 units<br>
against 10.15 ppg mud. Oil staining was common along with disseminated pyrite. The Lower Bakken<br>
Shale came in at 11,328' MD / 11,164' TVD, 4' low to prognosis and 1' low to Tobacco Garden 41-<br>
18SH and was similar to the Upper Bakken Shale, with a slightly browner color. Gas shows here got as<br>
high as 1,673u (C1 through C4). The final member, The Pronghorn, came in at 11,377' MD / 11,181'<br>
TVD, 4' low to prognosis and even to Tobacco Garden 41-18SH. This member consists of a medium gray<br>
to brown siltstone.<br>
<hr>
<A name=11></a>The targeted Three Forks Formation was observed at 11,402' MD / 11,188' TVD, 6' low to prognosis<br>
and even to Tobacco Garden 41-18SH. The observed lithology consisted of a cream to brown dolomite,<br>
which was crystalline with an earthy texture. This facies also exhibited laminations and contained<br>
disseminated pyrite. The targeted Three Forks lithology also contained a very light, mint green to pale<br>
blue shale that was occasionally off white. This lithology was soft to friable and contained disseminated<br>
and nodular pyrite. Spotty light brown oil staining and intercrystalline porosity were present throughout.<br>
The 20' target zone was 10' below the top of the Three Forks Formation (Figure 2), and consisted of the<br>
same argillaceous dolomite and shale. Gas shows ranged from 597 units to 3,007 units.<br>
Figure 2: Wet cuttings of the upper target Three Forks dolomite and shale (left) &amp; lower target dolomite and shale right).<br>
Lateral Gas and Oil Shows<br>
The background gas for the Ranger 21X-18E ranged from 125 to 2,664 units during the course of the<br>
lateral. The highest gas show was 3,007 units at 17,233' MD against 10.20 ppg mud. Higher gas shows<br>
were generally witnessed in the middle part of the target zone. The gas buster was venting throughout the<br>
lateral and a 10' trip flare was witnessed after re-entering the hole at 17,182'.<br>
Geo-steering<br>
A 20' target zone was chosen for the Ranger 21X-18E by XTO Energy geologists that began 10' below<br>
the Pronghorn and ended 6' from the top of the Second Bench of the Three Forks. The thickness was<br>
estimated using control well logs. A well drilled previously in Section 18, the Clouse 7-18, provided<br>
guidance for expected gamma ray markers while drilling the lateral (Figure 3). The top of the target zone<br>
would have gamma readings relatively high at about 96 API. Below this gamma would drop to 75 API<br>
before rising back up to its highest peak of 120 API. Below this high streak was the middle target zone<br>
low gamma where gamma would read around 50 API, gamma would then increase to 95 API. The<br>
wellbore was never drilled lower than right below the middle target zone cool streak.<br>

The prognosis projected the curve landing at 11,202' TVD. After the base of last salt came in at a TVD of<br>
9,565' it was decided to raise the target to 11,195'. When the gamma tool reached the Lodgepole 2<br>
marker and it came in at a TVD of 10,808' it was decided to lower the target to 11,202'. The False<br>
Bakken came in at a TVD of 11,094' which was 11' low to prognosis. It was decided that the target<br>
would be lowered to 11,205' and remain there until curve landing. The Three Forks Formation came in at<br>
a TVD of 11,188' which locked the landing target in at 11,208' TVD. The curve was landed successfully<br>
at 11,554' MD with a projected TVD of 11,207.35'--0.65' high to the final landing target and 9.35' into<br>
the target zone.<br>
Suggested prognosis dip provided by XTO Energy, Inc., stated that dip would be close to 0.30° down<br>
until around 16,000' MD, then dip would be flat until 18,000' MD. After the flat section it was suggested<br>
an up dip of around 0.50° would be witnessed for the remainder of the lateral. Structurally, the formation<br>
dropped an estimated 22.27' over 9,344' from landing to the end of the lateral resulting in an overall<br>
apparent dip of 0.14° down (Figure 4).<br>

Bottom-Hole Location<br>
Total depth resulted in a closure azimuth of 181.70° and a closure distance of 9,814.32'. The bottom-hole<br>
location is projected to be 9,809.99' south and 291.37' west of the surface location or approximately<br>
253.41' FSL &amp; 1,108.63' FWL, Lot 4 Section 19, T151N, R99W. The hole was prepared for liner and<br>
multi-stage fracture stimulation directly after drilling operations concluded.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The XTO Energy, Inc. Ranger 21X-18E was spud on October 18, 2014 by H&amp;P 456. The well efficiently<br>
reached TD in 18 total drilling days on November 4, 2014. Samples from the Three Forks target<br>
contained oil staining that was described as trace and spotty with visible intergranular porosity. MWD<br>
gamma ray markers, sample analysis, and ROP were successfully utilized to expose 100% of the lateral<br>
borehole to the Three Forks target zone. The Ranger 21X-18E awaits completion operations to maximize<br>
its production potential.<br>

Well site geologists caught lagged samples in 50' intervals from 2,235 feet to the 5,000' then caught samples in 100' intervals<br>

Dear Lisa:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23823, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft5">200' setback </span><span class="ft4">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft5">500' setback </span><span class="ft4">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the<br>
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 18 &amp; 19-T151N-R99W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must<br>
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are<br>
conducted. XTO ENERGY INC must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554<br>
prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum<br>
legal coordinate from the well head is: 9863' south.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey<br>
contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.<br>
Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director<br>
may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is<br>
hereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing<br>
on the date the well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well<br>
records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall<br>
permit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or<br>
controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to<br>
have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect<br>
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time<br>
upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and<br>
shall be available only to the Commission and its staff.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft3">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>

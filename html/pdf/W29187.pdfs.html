DETAILS OF WORK<br>
Hess requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55.<br>
Hess intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling<br>
rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for<br>
Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface<br>
casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to<br>
prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within<br>
the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that<br>
this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the<br>
NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller<br>
than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of,<br>
or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the<br>
above-referenced well. Hess understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this<br>
permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-<br>
02-03-19 &amp; 19.1). Hess will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the well is not drilled by the larger<br>
rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.<br>
Notify NDIC inspector Jason Hicks at 701-720-3523 with spud and TD info.<br>

Well File # 29187<br>
Dear Rachelle:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24627, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft5">200' setback </span><span class="ft4">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft5">500' setback </span><span class="ft4">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the<br>
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 28 &amp; 33, T155N and R94W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must<br>
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are<br>
conducted. HESS BAKKEN INVESTMENT II must contact NDIC Field Inspector Jason Hicks at 701-<br>
720-3523 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum<br>
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10013' south.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey<br>
contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.<br>
Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director<br>
may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft1">.<br>

Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is<br>
hereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing<br>
on the date the well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well<br>
records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall<br>
permit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or<br>
controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to<br>
have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect<br>

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>
Assistant Director<br>

Proposed Route of Sales Gas Flow: Gas will flow through an existing Hess gas line approximately ½ mile west<br>
along the route shown in Figure 1, then tie-in at the Johnson Central Facility. From there, the gas will flow north<br>
through a Hess gas line approximately 4 miles to the Myrtle Compressor. Gas will then flow northwesterly through<br>
a Hess gas line to the Tioga Gas Plant as can be seen in Figure 2.<br>

Statewide flaring: 25.79%<br>
Fieldwide flaring:<br>
13% (Alkali Creek)<br>
Flaring Alternatives:<br>
Mobile Gas Treatment Units:<br>
 </span><span class="ft1">GTUIT is a mobile flare gas capture technology for remote natural gas liquids (NGLs) extraction and gas<br>
conditioning processes. The systems strips out NGLs from the gas stream and refrigerates them for<br>
storage reducing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) thereby mitigating environmental impacts by<br>
significantly decreasing emissions from flare stacks. The Units can be combined and scaled up to handle<br>
high volumes of gas.<br>
<br>
Hess has contracted with GTUIT to provide mobile gas treatment units (MTUs). As of 8/13/2014, Hess has<br>
nine GTUIT units being utilized in the field and expects delivery of two additional units by 9/10/2014. The<br>
units have capacities ranging from 500 MSCFD to 1,000 MSCFD and can be relocated from one site to<br>
another. The units also can be linked onsite to provide a larger daily capacity intake.<br>
<br>
Hess is developing methodologies that will result in an order-of-merit list of candidate sites at which to<br>
deploy the MTUs, based on environmental, regulatory, economic, and operational factors. There are<br>
commercial constraints present which pertain to Hess's commercial agreement with GTUIT; wells must<br>
produce at least half of the MSCFD unit capacity and cover the initial connection fees in order for use of<br>
the GTUIT unit to be economic.<br>
Natural Gas Generators:<br>
<br>
Natural Gas Generators are an alternative to diesel generators to provide electricity to well pads located<br>
in remote areas. The units are tied directly into the natural gas production onsite and supplement liquid<br>
propane for use during hourly production fluctuation. Natural gas generators require liquid propane to be<br>
used when gas is not being produced from the well. As production of gas increases and decreases hourly,<br>
the units may switch from propane to natural gas and then back to propane.<br>
<br>
Hess performed two pilot programs to evaluate performance characteristics of natural gas generators<br>
from two manufacturers. Both manufacturers require further development to increase their reliability and<br>
performance of units.<br>
<br>
Economics favor diesel generators over natural gas generators at this time due to cost and reliability. Pilot<br>
program was not able to produce consistent results to move forward with field implementation at this<br>
time. Natural gas generators will continue to be evaluated as an alternative in the future.<br>
Bi-Fuel (Blended) Diesel Generators:<br>
<br>
Bi-Fuel diesel generators are diesel generators with natural gas "makeup" kit (blend kit) allowing units to<br>
use produced gas onsite to power the facility.<br>
<br>
Hess is currently in the conceptual phase of evaluation of Bi-Fuel Diesel Generators.<br>

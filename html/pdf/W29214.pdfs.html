1.0 INTRODUCTION<br>
RUUD 5493 41-23 6T is a North lateral Three Forks 1</span><span class="ft5">st </span><span class="ft3">Bench well, with a surface location of<br>
235' FSL- 521' FWL T154N R93W Sec 23, Mountrail County, North Dakota. The primary pay<br>
zone extended from 25.5' to 36.5' below the top of the Three Forks 1</span><span class="ft5">st </span><span class="ft3">Bench unit. This pay<br>
zone extended 3' into the Claystone 1 unit. This pay zone was selected due its drilling<br>
properties, its reliable gamma markers, its production potential, and quality of reservoir rock.<br>
The objective was to steer the well within the defined pay zone and within the legal requirements<br>
of the state. Directional and MWD services were performed by Pathfinder/Schlumberger. Chris<br>
Haynes, Ben Huffman, and Justin Ferguson were the well site geologists providing geo-steering<br>
and mud logging services. In the vertical portion of the well Chris Haynes, and Beach Hastings<br>
provided logging services, and steering through the curve, all from Columbine Logging, Inc.<br>

2.0 SERVICES<br>
2.1 Well site Geology </span><span class="ft6">(Columbine Logging, Inc.)<br>
Geological consulting and mud logging, for the vertical, started on 11/24/2014 and ran until<br>
11/28/2014, when TD of the curve was reached. On 11/29/2014 Ensign 158 skid over in order to<br>
drill the vertical and curve of RUUD 5493 41-23 5B. Once the vertical and curve on RUUD 5B<br>
was completed Ensign 158 skid over again to drill the vertical, curve and lateral for RUUD 5493<br>
41-23 4T3. Once 4T3 was completed Ensign 158 skid back to drill the lateral on RUUD 5493<br>
41-23 5B. On 1/12/2015 Ensign 158 skid back to RUUD 5493 41-23 6T in order to complete<br>
drilling operations on the lateral portion of the well. Services provided included; Morning<br>
reports, Afternoon reports, Evening reports, Midnight reports, Sample examination, Production<br>
of lithographic logs, Geo steering, Sample collection, sample mailing, and a final end of well<br>
report.<br>
2.1.1 Geosteering<br>
Columbine Logging arrived on location and rigged up for vertical drilling operations to provide<br>
mud logging and geosteering throughout the curve and lateral. Our primary offset GR TVD logs<br>
were from the RUUD 5493 42-23H well, located in 154N 93W 23 SE SW Mountrail County<br>
ND. From this offset log a target zone of 11' was determined to be 25.5' to 36.5' below the top<br>
of the Three Forks 1</span><span class="ft8">st </span><span class="ft5">Bench member. Within the lateral, the primary objective was to drill<br>
within the "TVD drilling window" defined by the 11 foot section identified above. Gamma<br>
markers were well defined throughout most of the well. An expected gamma cross section was<br>
provided by Nathan Gabelman from Oasis Petroleum and can be seen as appendix B.<br>
3<br>
<hr>
<A name=5></a>The primary marker targeted was located 3' above the E marker. This target was<br>
identified in gamma as a localized "bump" raging from 55 to 65 api. This area was bracketed<br>
above by an easily identifiable low then immediate high gamma sequence. The high with the<br>
sequence was approximately 85-95api, with the corresponding low raging approximately 50-60<br>
api. This sequence was identified as being the D marker. Below the target is also bracketed by<br>
an extended area of low gamma. This gamma ranging from 40-50 api, and is identified as the E<br>
marker. Below the E marker, is an area identified as the Claystone1 top. The window extended<br>
3' into the claystone. The gamma values associated with this boundary range from 120-160 api.<br>
This is identified as the F marker and the bottom of the TVD drilling window. The bracketing<br>
characteristics of the target area, made the target window easily identifiable. Throughout the<br>
lateral the only major change in lithology was associated with crossing the Claystone 1 unit<br>
boundary. The major difference in lithology seen was a shift from the arenaceous, moderate to<br>
poorly cemented, possibly dolomitic in nature, siltstone, seen through most of the drilling<br>
window, i.e. D and E markers, to the argillaceous, poorly cemented, well sorted, grey in color,<br>
claystone associated with the F marker. These slight differences in lithology were used to help<br>
correlate the location within the target window but generally were not distinct enough to specify<br>
exact location alone. Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating dip from relevant<br>
gamma markers, as well as by using lithology, and ROP to determine our position within the<br>
formation. The well reached its total depth (TD) approximately 2.5 feet above the center of the<br>
"TVD drilling window".<br>
2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys<br>
Gamma and survey MWD services were provided by Pathfinder. The gamma ray peaked at the<br>
upper extent of the F gamma marker. The F marker is located 8 feet below the top of the TVD<br>
drilling window, at the Claystone1 member top, within the Three Forks Formation. This gamma<br>
was approximately 120-160 api. The lowest values recorded throughout the lateral were<br>
recorded just above the claystone interface. These values were associated with the localized<br>
drop in values identified as being the E marker. The E marker starts approximately 1 foot below<br>
the center of the TVD drilling window. The rest of the drilling window experienced small,<br>
localized spikes and troughs that maintained an easily identifiable, reproducible pattern. While<br>
drilling in the "TVD drilling window" gamma fluctuated primarily between 40 and 160 API.<br>

2.2.1 Sample Examination<br>
Samples were collected by Columbine Logging every 30 feet from 7900' TVD in the vertical to<br>
7" casing point at 10,997' MD 10,656.21' TVD. While drilling the lateral, Columbine Logging<br>
collected samples every 30 feet, when possible, and 60 ft when ROP was above 150 feet per<br>
hour. Sample descriptions included; Lithology, color, firmness, grain size, structure, texture, oil<br>
stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was determined using a<br>
fluoroscope with a UV lamp. The ratings are based on 7 descriptors: none, slight trace, trace,<br>
fair, moderate, good, and Excellent. The descriptor used is based on the loggers' observations<br>
and best judgment of brilliance, color and longevity of the cut. Acetone was used as a cutting<br>
agent.<br>
2.2.2 Gas Detection<br>
Gas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas chromatograph system. The gas detection system<br>
uses an infra-red detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates and measures<br>
gases C1 (methane), C2 (ethane), C3 (propane), iC4 (iso-butane) and nC4 (normal butane). Gas<br>
was recorded in units where 1 unit equals 100 ppm. The gas detection system measured gases:<br>
C1, C2, C3, IC4, NC4, H2S, O2 and CO</span><span class="ft6">2, </span><span class="ft4">but only C1 through a total value of C4 (iC4+nC4)<br>
were logged.<br>
The Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system uses digital signal processing<br>
techniques and non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection. The system uses<br>
a proprietary chromatograph. This chromatograph has the capability to detect from 0 to 10,000<br>
gas units. This translates as 0 to 100% typical naturally-occurring hydrocarbon gas mixtures.<br>
Calibration is performed using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable<br>
calibration gases. Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%, and 100% pure methane. Complete<br>
immunity to saturation or damage in the presence of high concentrations of both light and heavy<br>
hydrocarbon gases precludes the necessity of constant re-calibration or zero referencing. This<br>
allows the Bloodhound to react to hydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration<br>
without dilution.<br>
Lag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump output, open<br>
hole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and bottom hole<br>
assembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations and to adjust lag<br>
time when needed.<br>

<A name=10></a>4.0 Gas Shows<br>
Gas was extremely prevalent throughout the lateral. The average gas recorded from the shoe at<br>
10,997MD to TD at 20,518MD was 2,717 units. The average of 2,702 units included an average<br>
percentage of 55% C1 Methane, 24% C2 Ethane, 14% C3 Propane, and 7% C4 Butane. The<br>
relatively high presence of heavy gasses (C3 &amp; C4) suggests the abundant presence of crude.<br>
The highest gas encountered was encountered at 15609MD and was a value of 3121.78 units.<br>
Gas logged while drilling the lateral is shown below.<br>
4.1 Oil Shows<br>
Invert was used as a drilling fluid during the vertical and curve sections of the well. The use of<br>
invert makes oil show calculations impossible during these sections. Oil was extensively present<br>
throughout most of the lateral. Fluorescence in the cuttings was described as: bright to brilliant,<br>
and the associated cuts were described as fast yellow to brown with the occasional bluish white.<br>
The overall oil show was rated on 7 descriptors: none, slight trace, trace, fair, moderate, good,<br>
and Excellent. The descriptor used, are based on the loggers' observations and best judgment of<br>
brilliance, color and longevity of the cut. The descriptors used to describe the speed of the cut<br>
which ranges from very slow to fast. Color descriptors are just that, the color observed by the<br>
logger. During the lateral the speed ranged from moderately fast, to instant, and color was very<br>
dull milky blue-white to dark yellowish brown. The overall ratings observed in the lateral<br>
ranged from moderate to fast very light blue-ish white cut all the way to instantaneous brownish<br>
yellow cut. Oil was consistently visible in the possum belly and on the shakers. Acetone was<br>
used as a cutting solvent.<br>

The surface location of RUUD 5493 41-23 6T is 235' FSL- 521' FWL T154N R93W Sec<br>
23, Mountrail County, North Dakota. The ground elevation is 2278' and KB elevation was<br>
2303', referenced to the Kelly bushing of Ensign 158. The curve was landed roughly 4 feet<br>
below the center of the target window, at 11,057'MD; 10,656' TVD, within the Claystone 1 unit<br>
of the Three Forks Formation.<br>
From the 7" shoe to TD the gamma markers throughout the formation<br>
displayed a predominantly consistent pattern. The primary marker targeted was located 3' above<br>
the E marker. This target was identified in gamma as a localized "bump" raging from 55 to 65<br>
api. This area was bracketed above by an easily identifiable low then immediate high gamma<br>
sequence. The high with the sequence was approximately 85-95api, with the corresponding low<br>
raging approximately 50-60 api. This sequence was identified as being the D marker. Below the<br>
target is also bracketed by an extended area of low gamma. This gamma ranging from 40-50 api,<br>
and is identified as the E marker. Below the E marker, is an area identified as the Claystone1<br>
top. The window extended 3' into the claystone. The gamma values associated with this<br>
boundary range from 120-160 api. This is identified as the F marker and the bottom of the TVD<br>
drilling window. The bracketing characteristics of the target area, made the target window easily<br>
identifiable.<br>
On 1/17/2015 at 17238 MD the second trip of the lateral, due to a mud motor failure<br>
began. This trip was concluded when the BHA made it back to the drill floor. Once on the drill<br>
floor it was discovered that the direction mud motor had come apart. This resulted in<br>
approximately 4 feet of the motor, and the drill bit being left in the hole. Oasis engineers then<br>
specified were we would sidetrack in order to avoid the down hole metal debris. 16,854' MD<br>
was selected for the sidetrack operations.<br>
The bit tended to climb throughout most of the well bore, with only a few exceptions.<br>
This tendency to climb forced the directional team to constantly monitor and take corrective<br>
action. The well bore exited the target window on 5 separate occasions. All the exits were out<br>
the top of the window. The exits can be attributed to the bits tendency to climb and the<br>
occasional "bounce" presumably from impacting a more competent material. All of the<br>
excursions out of the TVD target window, we on average approximately 200 feet in length. The<br>
total footage drilled outside the window was 1329'. The total length of the lateral from shoe to<br>
TD was 9521 feet. The total footage drilled outside the window accounted for approximately 14<br>
percent. Thus 86 percent was drilled within the target window. A TD of 20,518' MD, 10,598.5<br>
TVD, and location NWNW 274' FNL, 962' FWL SEC 14-T154N-R93W, Mountrail County, ND,<br>
USA, was reached at 16:09 CST on 1/21/2015.<br>

<A name=27></a>6.3 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION<br>
The RUUD 5493 41-23 6T is a North lateral well in the Three Forks 1</span><span class="ft3">st </span><span class="ft2">Bench unit. Spud date was<br>
November 20, 2014 from a surface location of 235' FSL- 521' FWL T154N R93W Sec 23, Mountrail<br>
County, North Dakota. The lateral was drilled to a total depth of 20,518'MD, 10,598.5'TVD,<br>
10060.44 VS, (projected) on January 21, 2015 with a projected bottom hole location of, NWNW 274'<br>
FNL, 962' FWL SEC 14-T154N-R93W, Mountrail County, ND, USA.<br>
The primary pay zone extended 11'from 25.5' to 36.5' below the top of the Three Forks 1</span><span class="ft3">st </span><span class="ft2">Bench<br>
member. Per the Geo prog provided by Oasis Petroleum the anticipated dip of the formation was<br>
90.30 degrees, based on a subsurface structure map provided by Oasis Petroleum. Our primary offset<br>
was RUUD 5493 42-23H well, located in 154N 93W 23 SE SW Mountrail County ND.<br>
The formation had a fairly consistent dip rate that varied from 89.14 degrees at its lowest, (granted this<br>
was for a very short period and calculation could have been affected by local thinning of the<br>
formation) to a 90.43 at its steepest. Average experienced dip of the formation was 90.31 degrees<br>
which is slightly greater than the expected dip of 90.30 degrees. The total average ROP throughout<br>
the entire lateral was approximately 80.3'/hr while drilling.<br>
The lateral was completed in 3 BHA's. Two directional mud motor failures caused the trips in<br>
order to change BHA's. On 1/17/2015 at 17238 MD the second trip of the lateral, due to a mud motor<br>
failure began. This trip was concluded when the BHA made it back to the drill floor. Once on the<br>
drill floor it was discovered that the direction mud motor had come apart. This resulted in<br>
approximately 4 feet of the motor, and the drill bit being left in the hole. Oasis engineers then<br>
specified were we would sidetrack in order to avoid the down hole metal debris. 16,854' MD was<br>
selected for the sidetrack operations.<br>
This well was completed with 6 BHA's. The 6</span><span class="ft3">th </span><span class="ft2">BHA was a reaming assembly due to the<br>
sidetrack being difficult to pass. The well reached TD at 20,518' MD, 10,598.5' TVD, 10,060.44 VS<br>
(projected) on January 21, 2015.<br>
Currently the well is awaiting completion</span><span class="ft5">.<br>

SWSW Section 23-154N-93W<br>
Mountrail County<br>
Well File # 29214<br>
Dear Brandi:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24825, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft4">200' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft4">500' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the<br>
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 23 &amp; 14 T154N R93W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must<br>
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are<br>
conducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Jason Hicks at 701-720-3523<br>
prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum<br>
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10125' north.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft4">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>
Assistant Director<br>

We expect to reduce the flared amount by ~30% by recovering 70  80% of the C3+.<br>

Brandi,<br>
This is in regards to the voicemail I left you. At the bottom of your GCP where your flaring<br>
alternatives are listed, it shows that you may install a temporary gas liquification unit, can you<br>
please add what percentage that would reduce your flaring if it was implemented? This can be<br>
found as item 6. b) on the GCP letter that was sent out. I attached both for your reference.<br>
Thank you very much,<br>

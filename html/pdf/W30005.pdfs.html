Williams County<br>
Well File # 30005<br>
Dear Chelsea:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24858, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval<br>
is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' setback<br>
from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit<br>
consisting of Sections 33 &amp; 28 T156N R101W. </span><span class="ft4">Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Oasis may set conductor on permitted wells only. In cases where a spacing unit<br>
is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be provided affirming that the surface owner of the<br>
multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property of the cuttings generated from drilling the wells into<br>
an offsite spacing unit. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock<br>
disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site<br>
during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. OASIS PETRO<br>
NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Jessica Gilkey at 701-770-7340 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling<br>
and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent<br>
pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are<br>
prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill<br>
cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is:<br>
440 N. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 10603<br>
N.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be<br>
waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to<br>
evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that<br>
would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the<br>
applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that<br>
notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas<br>
Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit<br>
number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00<br>
p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours<br>
or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall<br>
file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be<br>
submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the<br>
directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the<br>
director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a<br>
certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or<br>
when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours,<br>
and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the<br>
plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well<br>
bore, and (3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic<br>
cement evaluation log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior<br>
to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format)<br>
copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or<br>
attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>

RE:<br>
Oasis Petroleum Well Pad Sites<br>
REMARKS<br>
The five proposed well pads have been reviewed for airspace purposes in consideration of the<br>
close proximity of the well pads to the Alternative 2 airport site for Williston Airport. The well<br>
pads that have been reviewed are as follows:<br>
Harbour Andre ­ Two Well<br>
Harbour Andre ­ Five Well<br>
Harbour McCauley ­ Four Well<br>
Shepherd Holmes ­ Two Well<br>
Shepherd Holmes ­ Four Well<br>
The following are the facts as they have been determined:<br>
-<br>
The Ultimate Runway End Elevation 2,210' MSL (48° 17' 23.23"N 103° 41' 47.25"W) [This<br>
was based on the submitted FAA 7480 Form designating a proposed airport coordinates and<br>
elevations]<br>
-<br>
Approach slope 50:1 beginning 200' from the runway threshold<br>
-<br>
Permanent structures will exist on the well pads up to 40' AGL<br>
-<br>
Drilling Rig 185' AGL with work expected to begin as early as March 2014 and end no later<br>
than March 2016 (actual expectation from Oasis is by December 2014)<br>
-<br>
Work Over Rigs 104' AGL will operate on the well pads through the life of the well on a<br>
temporary basis.<br>
Based on this information the following was determined:<br>
-<br>
The Well Pads are outside of the planned Runway Protection Zones<br>
-<br>
Due to the close proximity of the well pads an FAA Form 7460 should be filed for the<br>
permanent structures up to 40' AGL<br>
<hr>
<A name=41></a>-<br>
The 7460 forms for the well pads permanent structures were filed with the FAA on<br>
December 18, 2013 with the following Obstruction Evaluation numbers (4 OEs for each<br>
well pad to portray the four corners of each well pad):<br>

-<br>
The drilling rigs will complete their work prior to construction of the airport and according<br>
to the FAA there is no need to file a 7460 for these drilling rigs per discussion with Fred<br>
Souchet, FAA Air Traffic Specialist<br>
-<br>
Through the life of the wells the work over rigs and their 104' AGL height will require a<br>
7460 form to be filed prior to authorization to erect the work over rigs<br>
-<br>
Given all that has been examined, there are no apparent obstructions to Williston Site 2's<br>
protected airspace if the proposed well pads were to be developed.<br>
The determination by the FAA will take 60-90 days and is expected to be favorable. It is<br>
recommended that Oasis Petroleum proceed with all other necessary permitting and it is expected<br>
that the FAA determination will be concluded prior to construction of the well pads.<br>
As noted above the well operator will be required to complete a FAA Form 7460 in the future prior<br>
to erection of a work over rigs on any of the proposed well locations. Conditions such as<br>
obstruction lighting on the rig would likely be required.<br>
If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to let us know.<br>

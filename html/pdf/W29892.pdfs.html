HORIZONTAL WELL<br>
KELSEY ELIZABETH 1-7-6H-141-95<br>
NENW Section 18-141N-95W<br>
Dunn County<br>
Well File # 29892<br>
Dear Elizabeth:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 15209, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft3">200' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">1220' setback </span><span class="ft1">(per Commission policy) from the east &amp;<br>
west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 6 &amp; 7 T141N R95W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: USE OF DRILLING PIT AND LOCATION OF DRILLING PIT UPON<br>
NDIC FIELD INSPECTOR'S APPROVAL. AN ON-SITE INSPECTION IS REQUIRED. In cases<br>
where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be provided affirming that<br>
the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property of the cuttings<br>
generated from drilling the well into an offsite spacing unit. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof<br>
container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the<br>
well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration<br>
operations are conducted. OXY USA Inc. must take into consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety<br>
Regulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned location. Pursuant to<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) "No boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be<br>
placed nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank." OXY USA INC must contact NDIC Field<br>
Inspector Nicole Nelson at 701-290-1527 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing<br>
point is: 536 N. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well<br>
head is: 10691 N.<br>

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested<br>
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the<br>
Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal<br>
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are<br>
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft4">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>

October 13, 2014<br>
<hr>
<A name=28></a><hr>
<A name=29></a>Pad<br>
The wells that will be located on the Wolberg NWNW 18 Pad are shown in the table below.<br>
Pipeline Notification<br>
This well will be connected to Hiland's low pressure gathering system in Dunn County, North<br>
Dakota. Oxy's acreage that comprises the spacing unit (SU) for the Kelsey Elizabeth 1-7-6H-<br>
141-95 is dedicated to Hiland. Under terms of the contract, Hiland is obligated to install the<br>
facilities that are required to connect these wells to its gathering system. Oxy provides (on a<br>
monthly basis) to Hiland a drilling, completion and estimated first production date for all wells<br>
that are scheduled to be drilled in the foreseeable future. In addition, Oxy and Hiland have<br>
conference calls to discuss connection status of wells and changes to Oxy's drilling and<br>
completion schedules when needed.<br>
Gathering System<br>
Gas from this pad will be gathered on Hiland's low pressure WC-Manning Gathering System<br>
and processed at Hiland's Watford City Processing Plant located in Section 6, T151N, R102W,<br>
McKenzie County, North Dakota.<br>
In addition to Hiland, ONEOK owns and operates a low pressure gathering line located on the<br>
same pad. ONEOK's lines, along with Hiland's, are shown on the attached maps.<br>
The production facilities for the Kelsey Elizabeth 1-7-6H-141-95 well will be located adjacent to<br>
Oxy's Wolberg 21-18H production facilities which are connected to ONEOK's low pressure<br>
gathering system. It will require approximately two and one-half miles of pipe to connect the<br>
Kelsey Elizabeth 1-7-6H-141-95 well to Hilands's low pressure gathering system.<br>
Existing Lines<br>
At the terminus of the metering and associated piping at the well's production facilities, Hiland<br>
will construct approximately two and one-half miles of 6.625" outside diameter (OD) gathering<br>
line. This 6.625" OD gathering line will connect to Hiland's 10.75" OD gathering line. The<br>
10.75" OD gathering line traverses approximately two miles and then connects to a 12.75" OD<br>
gathering line that traverses approximately six miles and connects to the inlet header at Hiland's<br>
Manning Compressor Station located in Section 29, T142N, 96W, Dunn County, ND. The table<br>
below shows the estimated capacities and current flows of the gathering lines connecting this<br>
pad.<br>
<hr>
<A name=30></a>Hiland stated in a recent meeting that their gathering system in this area had sufficient capacity<br>
to gather gas from wells Oxy currently plans on drilling on the dedicated acreage. Hiland further<br>
stated that the Manning compressor station was designed to allow for the installation of<br>
additional compressors when required as volume increases on the gathering system.<br>
Flowback Strategy<br>
After the fracture treatment, this well will be flowed through a choke to test production tanks.<br>
Choke size will depend on final shut in pressure post frac and well pressure prior to opening the<br>
choke. The choke will be adjusted up or down based on flowing pressure, liquid rates and sand<br>
returns, to prevent clogging manifold chokes. During flowback, the water chlorides and sand<br>
content will be monitored. When the water chlorides are greater than 100,000 ppm and the<br>
produced fluids contain no sand, the well will be turned to production facilities. It is anticipated<br>
that Hiland will have its gathering line extension constructed and Oxy will have its production<br>
facilities constructed before flowback starts, and gas sales should start as soon as the well starts<br>
flowing through the production facilities.<br>
Based on current information, it is our belief the<br>
system can take this gas upon completion of this well.<br>
This well is expected to initially flow 445 barrels of oil and 200 thousand cubic feet of gas per<br>
day based on Oxy's production type curve of this area. Based on current drilling and completion<br>
plans, this well will be completed shortly after drilling is finished. It is anticipated this well will<br>
decline sharply after initial production as do the majority of horizontal wells in the Williston<br>
Basin.<br>
Current Flaring<br>
The table below shows gas produced and sold by Oxy per Gas Production Report - Form 5B that<br>
was file by Oxy for August 2014 reporting period. The percent sold and percent flared are also<br>
shown in the table.<br>
<hr>
<A name=31></a>Flaring Alternative<br>
The well on this pad will be connected to a pipeline prior to production and Oxy does not expect<br>
to flare gas. Below are three alternatives that Oxy considered from a conceptual standpoint to<br>
reduce the amount of gas flared. More generally, Oxy is continuing to review the possible<br>
impact of implementing one or more of these alternatives as appropriate in our operations.<br>
1) NGL Removal ­ On Lease<br>
Captures highest value components in gas stream<br>
Plants are expensive<br>
Uneconomical to operate when volume declines<br>
Residue gas is still flared<br>
2) Power Generation ­ On Lease<br>
Savings if current generation's fuel supply is diesel<br>
Only a portion of gas is consumed operating the generator, remainder of gas will<br>
be flared<br>
Due to gas quality, high NGL content, preference is to purchase power from the<br>
grid and not operate generation on site<br>
3) Compressed Natural Gas ­ On lease<br>
Well site compressors are required to fill CNG trailers<br>
Large capital outlay for equipment and operating cost, includes trucking of<br>
products, are expensive<br>
No gas would be flared, but might be uneconomical to operate when gas volume<br>
declines<br>

I, William H. Dolinar, Professional Land Surveyor, ND. RLS #6550, hereby certify that (in accordance with a request from Cody Dennison with Oxy USA, Inc., 3239 Highway<br>
22, Dickinson, North Dakota 58601) I and/or personnel under my direction made a survey on the 17th day of July 2014, for the Surface Hole Location and Elevation of platted<br>
well, being located within the NE1/4NW1/4 of Section 18, T141N, R95W of the 5th P.M., Dunn County, State of North Dakota.<br>
Notes: All Azimuths are based on the West line of the Northwest Quarter of Section 18, T141N, R95W of the 5th P.M., being an Azimuth of 359°59'40&quot; using GPS<br>
observations, occupying a WHS control point (5/8" rebar) and having the Location and Elevation derived from an OPUS Solution and GEOID 09. Azimuths shown have been<br>
rotated 1°39'43.30434&quot; West from SPC Grid bearings to Geodetic North, based on convergence angle provided by a conversion using Corpscon.<br>
Project elevations are held on the control point located 271°39'16&quot;, 1197.95 Feet, from the Northeast Corner of Section 18, T141N, R95W of the 5th P.M. having a NAVD 88<br>
elevation of 2608.23 feet.<br>
Distances shown are Ground Distances using a combined scale factor of 1.00017719.<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>
Assistant Director<br>

PERMIT STIPULATION<br>
Dear OPERATOR:<br>
The below stipulation is applicable to all of the permits on the enclosed list.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be<br>
maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out,<br>
completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted.<br>

McKenzie County<br>
Well File # 22232<br>
Dear LB:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 17315, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft4">200' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft4">500' setback </span><span class="ft2">from the east &amp; west boundaries within<br>
the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 9 &amp; 10-T149N-R94W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS:<br>
EOG RESOURCES INC must contact NDIC Field Inspector Allen<br>
Christensen at 701-989-9183 prior to location construction. A Closed Mud System is required on multi-<br>
well pads, although the disposal of drill cuttings is contingent upon site specific conditions to be<br>
determined by an NDIC Field Inspector.<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinates from the well head at casing<br>
point is: 208' N &amp; 262' W. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinates<br>
from the well head is: 9288' E &amp; 4665' S.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via check No. 1191855538 .The permit fee has been received. It is<br>
requested that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be<br>
relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well<br>
name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.<br>
Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701)<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor<br>
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys<br>
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may<br>
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Reserve pit<br>
Please be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on<br>
this site if specific site conditions warrant.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of<br>
cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma<br>
Ray Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as<br>
one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image<br>
logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced<br>
in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to<br>
follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a<br>
TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its<br>
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5" floppy diskette, a standard<br>
CD, or attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

The 4-1/2&quot; production liner is 11.6 lb/ft, Grade HCP-110 with LT&amp;C connections. The liner is run<br>
to within 10 - feet of total depth of the lateral. The liner hanger is set at the Kick Off Point of the<br>
lateral or at the base of the 70° tangent (if present). The liner will typically have 20 swell packers<br>
installed on it. The swell packers divide the lateral into equal intervals of about 450 feet each.<br>

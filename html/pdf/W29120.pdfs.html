GEOLOGIST'S SUMMARY<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
XTO Energy, Inc.'s Eide 31X-29C (250' FNL, 2479' FEL, NWNE Sec 29, T158N-R95W, Williams Co.,<br>
ND) is located approximately 6 miles northwest of Tioga, in Williams Co. ND. The well is east of the<br>
Nesson anticline and part of a 4 well pad program designed to develop oil production in a unit<br>
composed of parts of Sections 29 and 32. The Eide 31X-29C well was drilled to 1,914' and 9-<br>
5/8"surface casing set to a depth of 1,909' MD, then drilled to 9950' and 7" intermediate casing was set<br>
to a depth of 9,936'. The lateral was then drilled to 19304' and a production liner run. The well is to be a<br>
Middle Bakken lateral. The intent was to remain in the 18' thick Target Zone of the Middle Bakken,<br>
stratigraphically situated from 22' to 40' beneath the base of the Upper Bakken Shale. Through<br>
geosteering and directional drilling techniques the wellbore was drilled to maximize its extent in the<br>
target zone to the Total Depth of 19304'.<br>
EQUIPMENT AND SAMPLING<br>
Gas detection and wellsite geological supervision commenced at 8,000', above the base of the last salt.<br>
Geologic analysis for Eide 31X-29C was provided by a Decollement Consulting geology team.<br>
Information was networked through a Pason electronic data recorder system. This equipment provided<br>
depth, ROPs, pump strokes, total gas units, and other drilling parameters to monitors across the drilling<br>
location and internet.<br>
Sample collection began above the base of the last salt and continued with 30' interval samples until<br>
total depth was reached. Rock cuttings were analyzed in wet and dry conditions under a binocular<br>
microscope and also with a fluoroscope to analyze fluorescence and solvent cuts. Detailed lithologic<br>
descriptions are included in the lithology portion to this report. Sample quality was good for most of the<br>
well. Cuttings will be sent to the North Dakota Geologic Survey and to XTO Energy, Inc.<br>
OFFSET DATA<br>
The primary offset wells used for structural correlation during curve operations were the XTO Energy,<br>
Inc. Eide 31X-29G, and the Petro-Hunt Pederson AI 1 wells. These wells were useful in the vertical<br>
hole and during curve drilling operations while landing the well. The TVD log of the Middle Bakken from<br>
the Eide 31-29G well was used as the main reference during the horizontal geosteering of the well.<br>
DRILLING THE VERTICAL AND CURVE HOLE SECTIONS<br>
The Eide 31X-29C spudded October 20, 2014 and reached a surface casing depth of 1914' and was<br>
cased and cemented to 1909'. The intermediate and curve hole section was then drilled to 9950' and 7"<br>
casing was run to 9936' and cemented in preparation for the drilling of the lateral in the Middle Bakken.<br>
Gas detection and wellsite geological supervision commenced at 8,000', several hundred feet above<br>
the base of the last salt. Hydrocarbon constituents (C1 through C4) are expressed in part-per-million<br>
concentrations. Sampled gas was pulled from Pason's agitator in the possum belly and analyzed by<br>
Pason's Gas Analyzer to deliver the compositional data</span><span class="ft10">.<br>
A successful Middle Bakken landing was accomplished by comparing gamma signatures from the<br>
offsets to the MWD TVD gamma ray log produced during the drilling of the Eide 31X-29G. The landing<br>
target true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically updated to ensure accurate landing of the curve within<br>
the Middle Bakken as near the target window as possible.<br>
5<br>
<hr>
<A name=12></a>The Base of the Last Salt of the Charles Formation was encountered at a depth of 8,134' MD (TVD<br>
8,130'). At MD 8,175' (TVD 8,171') the Ratcliffe was entered, and was a light to medium grey algal<br>
limestone (mudstone) was drilled. Some stringers of anhydrite were also noted. The Mission Canyon<br>
formation (a gray dense to finely crystalline mudstone) was then drilled into at MD 8,335' (TVD 8,332').<br>
The Lodgepole formation came in at 8,950' MD (8,947 TVD). Samples showed a medium to dark grey<br>
mudstone. Drilling then continued through the Lodgepole limestone to the KOP at 9,155' MD. The BHA<br>
was changed out to a curve building assembly, the BHA was then tripped in and the curve was drilled<br>
to 9,950' MD. Background gas varied from 45 units to 116 units during the curve drilling of the<br>
Lodgepole. Sliding continued through the Lodgepole formation to the top of the Upper Bakken Shale,<br>
which gamma showed coming in at MD 9,755' (TVD 9,590'), a 14' zone of black carbonaceous shale<br>
with some pyrite. The highest gas reading recorded was 685 units</span><span class="ft2">. </span><span class="ft0">The Middle Bakken Dolomite was<br>
encountered at MD 9,755' (TVD 9,590'), with gamma and samples confirming the light gray, very silty<br>
dolomite. Some dull yellow fluorescence was observed that had a good flush cut when exposed to<br>
solvent. Total gas units ranged from 90 to 510 units with proportionate C1 through C4's.<br>
GEOLOGIC INTERPRETATION OF THE MIDDLE BAKKEN TARGET SECTION<br>
For geosteering and evaluation purposes a TVD log of the well's target zone was created from the<br>
MWD data recorded during the drilling of the Eide 31X-29G and then used as a reference during the<br>
drilling of the lateral by the wellsite team. See figure 1.<br>
Figure 1. TVD gamma log of the Eide 31X-29G well.<br>
During the lateral there were some continuing similarities in the samples and gamma readings as the<br>
wellbore traversed the stratigraphic section of the target zone. The drilled cuttings observed were<br>
mostly composed of calcareous, very silty and sandy dolomites ranging from mudstone to wackestone<br>
in the Dunham classification. The colors were mostly light grey and very light brown. The cuttings<br>
ranged from soft to firm throughout the target section and were clean to slightly argillaceous. Minor<br>
constituents were mostly of anhydrite and pyrite seen mainly as the well path went through the upper<br>
portion of the target zone in the first half of the well and below the target zone in the second half of the<br>
well where the anhydrite and pyrite lessened considerably in the target zone. The most distinctive<br>
changes when drilling through the section were noticed in the color of the uppermost portion of the<br>
target zone when drilling the low gamma, clean dolomitic limestone known locally as the "packstone". It<br>
was off white to a very light brown and contained significant amounts of pyrite in some samples. This<br>
6<br>
<hr>
<A name=13></a>clean rock also damaged the bit so that a trip for a new bit was required after drilling around 500 feet of<br>
it.<br>
The hydrocarbon shows seen during the lateral consisted of a sometimes barely perceptible, very dull<br>
to dull yellow fluorescence that varied from less than 10 up to 70 percent of the cuttings, with the<br>
solvent cuts ranging from poor to good flush cuts.<br>
DRILLING AND GEOSTEERING OF THE MIDDLE BAKKEN LATERAL<br>
The geosteering of the lateral was done by the XTO Operations Geologist with input from the wellsite<br>
geologic team, with a goal of maximizing the wellbore contact with the best reservoir rock available<br>
while minimizing dogleg severity and drilling as fast as conditions permitted.<br>

The well began with a mild up dip for the first several thousand feet that gradually transitioned into a<br>
down dip of probably around 89.2 degrees. This down dip continued until 13000' when the dip lessened<br>
to around 89.8 degrees for roughly 3000' before flattening out to a 90.1 degrees plus or minus ~2<br>
tenths of a degree until the well reached Total Depth at 19304' MD.<br>

HORIZONTAL WELL<br>
EIDE 31X-29C<br>
NWNE Section 29-158N-95W<br>
Williams County<br>
Well File # 29120<br>
Dear Richard:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24759, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The<br>
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than<br>
the </span><span class="ft5">200' setback </span><span class="ft4">from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft5">500' setback </span><span class="ft4">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the<br>
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 29 &amp; 32-158N-95W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for<br>
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must<br>
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are<br>
conducted. XTO ENERGY INC. must take into consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation)<br>
when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned location. Pursuant to NDAC 43-<br>
02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) "No boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be placed<br>
nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank." XTO ENERGY INC must contact NDIC Field<br>
Inspector Tom Delling at 701-770-8660 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well<br>
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will<br>
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits<br>
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.<br>
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings<br>
pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.<br>
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum<br>
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10116' south.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may<br>
<hr>
<A name=59></a>be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information<br>
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other<br>
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the<br>
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given<br>
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division,<br>
Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,<br>
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.<br>
and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours<br>
or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey<br>
contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.<br>
Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director<br>
may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the<br>
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe<br>
document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve<br>
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is<br>
hereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing<br>
on the date the well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well<br>
records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall<br>
permit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or<br>
controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to<br>
have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect<br>
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time<br>
upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and<br>
shall be available only to the Commission and its staff.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12<br>
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi<br>
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs </span><span class="ft3">NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and<br>
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation<br>
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.<br>
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log<br>
ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to<br>
digitallogs@nd.gov </span><span class="ft0">Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>
Assistant Director<br>

Logging, DST and Coring Program<br>
1. A mud log will be run from Base of Last Salt to KOP and on all laterals: Mudlog to include: total gas chromatograph and sample cuttings -<br>
30' sample intervals in vertical hole &amp; 30' intervals in laterals. A CBL/GR log will be run from deepest free-fall depth in 7 inch casing to<br>
surface. A MWD GR/ROP log will also be run from KOP (where the CBL will tie into) to TD of lateral.<br>
2. Open hole logs are NOT planned at this time.<br>
3. DSTs are NOT planned at this time.<br>
H2S<br>
All H2S related safety equipment must be installed, tested, and operational at a depth of 500' above, or 3 days prior to penetrating the first zone<br>
expected to contain H2S (Mission Canyon).<br>
Maximum Formation Pressure and Temp<br>
1. Normal formation pressure gradient is expected (up to 0.5 psi/ft or 9.6 ppg) from surface to the Bakken Shale. The Bakken Shale and Bakken Middle<br>
Member may be over pressured up to as much as 0.65 psi/ft (12.5 ppg).<br>
2. The maximum anticipated BHT is </span><span class="ft3">260 </span><span class="ft4">F or less.<br>
BOP Equipment Requirements<br>
See attached diagram detailing BOPE specifications.<br>
1. Rig will be equipped with upper and lower kelly cocks with handles available.<br>
2. Inside BOP and TIW valves will be available to use on all sizes and threads of DP used on well.<br>
3. BOP accumulator will have enough capacity to close HCR valve, close all rams and annular preventer, and retain minimum of 200 psi<br>
above precharge on the closing manifold without the use of closing pumps. The fluid reservoir capacity shall be at least double the usable<br>
fluid volume of the accumulator system capacity &amp; the fluid level shall be maintained at manufacturer's recommendation. There will be 2<br>
additional sources of power for the closing pumps (electric and air). Sufficient N2 bottles will be available and will be recharged when<br>
Page 2<br>
Eide 31X-29C Permit Pkg 70714.xlsx<br>
<hr>
<A name=66></a>pressure falls below manufacturer's minimum<br>
4. BOP ram preventers will be tested to 5,000 psi for 10 minutes using a test plug (a) when initially installed, (b) after 7 inch casing is nippled<br>
up, (c) whenever any seal is broken or repaired, (d) if the time since the previous test exceeds 30 days. Additionally, BOP and casing strings<br>
will be tested to .22 psi/ft (or 1,500 psi minimum) for 30 minutes, prior to drilling out 9-5/8&quot; and 7&quot; casing. Rams and hydraulically operated<br>
remote choke line valve will be function tested daily at a minimum (preferably test at every crew change).<br>
5. Remote valve for BOP rams, HCR &amp; choke shall be placed in a location that is readily available to the Driller. The remote BOP valve shall<br>
be capable of closing and opening the rams.<br>
6. Hand wheels on BOP shall be equipped with locking devices. A locking device shall be placed on annular preventer line valve &amp; must be<br>
locked in the open position. This lock shall only be removed when the closing unit is inoperative.<br>
Drilling Fluid and Related Equipment<br>
1. Pumps shall be equipped with stroke counters with displays located in dog house. Slow pump speed shall be recorded on drilling report<br>
at least daily after mudding up (preferably at every crew change).<br>
2. A Pit Volume Totalizer will be installed and the readout will be displayed in the dog house.<br>
3. Gas detecting equipment (for a chromatagraph) will be installed at shaker. Readouts will be available in dog house and in geologist trailer.<br>
4. In the event gas flow becomes an issue. A flare pit shall be constructed not less than 100' from wellhead &amp; 50' from cuttings handling area.<br>
Lines to the flare pit will be straight runs (staked down) and turns will utilize targeted tees. Flare pit will be located down wind as much as<br>
possible. An electronic ignitor will be used along with a propane line to provide for a continuous flare pilot.<br>

Well File # 29407<br>
Dear Meghan:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 24257, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval<br>
is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">500' setback<br>
from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">200' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit<br>
consisting of Sections 1 &amp; 2 T150N-R95W. </span><span class="ft4">Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter<br>
sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site<br>
during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. QEP ENERGY<br>
COMPANY must ensure the drilling pit is not constructed in a porous material (i.e.: sand, coal, gravel, or<br>
scoria).<br>
APPROVAL OF THE REMOTE PRODUCTION FACILITY IS DEPENDENT UPON<br>
FURTHER NDIC REVIEW. QEP may set conductor on permitted wells only. QEP ENERGY CO must<br>
contact NDIC Field Inspector Joyce Kohut at 701-202-1288 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling<br>
and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent<br>
pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are<br>
prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill<br>
cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal<br>
coordinates from the well head are: 416 S &amp; 9727 E.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be<br>
waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to<br>
evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that<br>
would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the<br>
applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that<br>
notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas<br>
Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit<br>
number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00<br>
p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours<br>
or on the weekend.<br>
Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall<br>
file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be<br>
submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the<br>
directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the<br>
director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a<br>
certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or<br>
when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours,<br>
and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the<br>
plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well<br>
bore, and (3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic<br>
cement evaluation log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior<br>
to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format)<br>
copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or<br>
attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>

NOTES ON 9-5/8" SURFACE CASING DESIGN:<br>
The key point in designing surface casing is to extend the shoe of the surface casing beyond the top of<br>
the Pierre Shale. This ensures that all potable or usable water zones are covered. At this point in the well<br>
design, the drilling fluid is changed to oil base mud to contend with salt sections that occur at<br>
approximately 6,700' TVD and 9,100' TVD. The 36 ppf J55 casing accomplishes these criteria easily.<br>
A higher burst rating is not necessary based on industry standards throughout the Williston Basin.<br>
In the event the surface casing burst rating was increased, the normally pressured and sub normally<br>
pressured zones all the way thru the Madison Group at approximately 8,350' TVD has the potential to<br>
break down. Therefore the increased pressure rating of surface casing is not warranted. It is not feasible<br>
to set the surface casing point at a greater depth because the shut in surface pressures would not<br>
appreciably increase. The Dakota formation (5,000' TVD) is frequently weak. Typically, we drill the<br>
intermediate section with 10.5 ppg OBM to the 7" casing point. In the event we lost circulation in the<br>
exposed intermediate interval, the wellbore will not be entirely evacuated and the surface casing can be<br>
shut in without compromising the pressure rating of the 36 ppf J-55.<br>
Calculations for the Surface Casing Design:<br>
3,520 psi/ (5,863 psi (Reservoir Pressure) ­ (10,738 ft x 0.22 psi/ft)) = safety factor of 1.0<br>

Additional Information For Oil Base Mud<br>
A. Oil-base mud will be mixed in the closed circulating system and transferred to 500-bbl tanks on<br>
location for storage prior to and after drilling operations. Drip pans will be installed below the<br>
rotary beams on the substructure and can be viewed on site from the cellar area. As the intermediate<br>
and production section of the hole is drilled, the cuttings transported to the surface with the drilling<br>
fluid will be mechanically separated from the drilling fluid as waste by shale-shakers and then<br>
cleaned/dried via a mud cleaner and/or centrifuge. These separated cuttings will be transferred to a<br>
container, dried and stabilized, and then transported to an approved disposal site or, if a cuttings pit<br>
is approved, the solidified and dried cuttings will be stored in the pit.<br>
B. Plastic material will underlay the rig, oil base mud/diesel storage tanks and mud pits. All tanks on<br>
location will be placed inside of berms. Any oily waste fluids and sediments generated at the work<br>
site during drilling operations or when cleaning the fluid containment system after drilling will also<br>
be stabilized and then transported to an approved disposal site or, if a cuttings pit is approved, it will<br>
be solidified and stored in the cuttings pit.<br>

C. All rig ditches will be lined and directed to a lined sump for fluid recovery. A drip pan will be<br>
installed on the BOP stack, a mud bucket will be utilized as needed on connections and a vacuum<br>
system will be used on the rig floor for fluid recovery in those areas.<br>

D. If a cuttings pit is deemed necessary and acceptable due to unforeseen circumstances and/or<br>
complications with the disposal method described in 10.A above, drill solids and excess cement will<br>
be placed in the cuttings pit and the oilfield waste management consultant Soli-Bond (or a similar<br>
company) will mobilize equipment and personnel to the site to perform the cement based<br>
solidification/stabilization process in-situ for encapsulation with cement kiln dust or flyash prior to<br>
placement in the cuttings pit. Once the drilling operation is complete, the lined cuttings pit will be<br>
reclaimed to grade elevation.<br>

1. Affidavit: attached as a part of this gas capture plan.<br>
2. Detailed gas gathering pipeline system location map<br>
Oneok Rockies Midstream ("OKRM")<br>
Name and Location of gas processing plant: </span><span class="ft3">Garden Creek, Sect 35-T151N-R98W<br>
Name of gas gatherer and location of lines for each gas gatherer in the vicinity: </span><span class="ft3">OKRM 16" poly<br>
highlighted in red, pending ROW acquisition and construction.<br>
Proposed Route and Tie-in point for wel connection: </span><span class="ft3">See above gathering system map.<br>
3. Detailed information for Blue Buttes/Grail/Sandstone compression capacity (circled in blue):<br>
Maximum current daily capacity: </span><span class="ft3">Total: 95 MMcfd (Sandstone: 60; Blue Buttes: 35; Grail: 0) Note: Grail<br>
station expected to start-up in mid-September 2014.<br>
Current throughput: </span><span class="ft3">Total: 82 MMcfd (Sandstone: 60; Blue Buttes: 22; Grail: 0) Note: Grail station<br>
expected to start-up in mid-September 2014.<br>
Anticipated daily capacity at date of first gas sales: </span><span class="ft3">Total: 130 MMcfd (Sandstone: 60; Blue Buttes: 35;<br>
Grail: 35).<br>
<hr>
<A name=41></a>Anticipated throughput at date of first gas sales: </span><span class="ft1">Total: 130 MMcfd (Sandstone: 60; Blue Buttes: 35;<br>
Grail: 35).<br>
Gas gatherer issues or expansion plans for the area: </span><span class="ft1">Beginning September, 2014, OKRM has adequate<br>
pipeline, processing plant and compression capacity for QEP's current and forecasted gas through mid-<br>
2015. These midstream facilities were designed to handle approximately 70 MMcfd of QEP's gas.<br>
Should future iterations of QEP's volume forecast exceed 70 MMcfd, QEP will require another OKRM<br>
expansion for compression and pipelines and has alerted OKRM of this possibility.<br>
4. Detailed flowback strategy:<br>
Anticipated date of first production: </span><span class="ft1">1</span><span class="ft3">st </span><span class="ft1">Quarter of 2015<br>

5. QEP flaring amounts:<br>
Statewide percentage of gas flared for existing wells in the Bakken petroleum system: </span><span class="ft1">53% for the most<br>
recent month of July 2014 (28.0 MMcfd flared /52.5 MMcfd produced).<br>
Field wide percentage of gas flared for this well: </span><span class="ft1">0% in the Spotted Horn field for the most recent month<br>
of July 2014 (0.0 MMcfd flared/0.7 MMcfd produced).<br>
6. QEP Alternatives to flaring:<br>
Specific alternative systems available for consideration: </span><span class="ft1">When OKRM is at capacity or not connected,<br>
QEP has considered and implemented JT conditioning skids for its flaring wel s. QEP has done this on 3<br>
pads in Sections 33, 34 &amp; 35 of T149N-R95W (vendor Montana-Dakota). QEP also is looking at site usage<br>
for a number of applications to include powering wellhead equipment, drilling rigs, gas lift, etc. Further,<br>
QEP is installing gas-powered generators on our pads in the Mandaree field (FBIR) instead of using diesel<br>
fuel (second half of 2014).<br>
<hr>
<A name=42></a>Details of flaring reductions if such alternative plans are implemented: </span><span class="ft2">No significant flaring reductions<br>
have been achieved from our implemented or planned alternative systems thus far. However, the<br>
Montana-Dakota JT skids do reduce our VOCs by 85% where they are installed.<br>

Ah, yes. Sorry I forgot to put a note in regards to that. Yes, we have submitted Federal permits and<br>
are just awaiting the final approval.<br>
Thanks,<br>

Meghan,<br>
This email is just to confirm that QEP is aware that this pad contains wells in which the laterals<br>
penetrate federal minerals. If yes, are you in the process of obtaining the proper federal permits?<br>
Thank you<br>

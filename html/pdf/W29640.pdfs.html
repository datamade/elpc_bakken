Well File # 29640<br>
Dear DEB:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 25001, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is granted on<br>
the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">500' </span><span class="ft1">setback from the north &amp; south<br>
boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">200' </span><span class="ft1">setback from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1920 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 7, 8 &amp; 9 T150N<br>
R91W. </span><span class="ft3">Tool error is not required pursuant to order.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be<br>
maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-<br>
back whenever filtration operations are conducted. DUE TO DRAINAGE ADJACENT TO THE WELL SITE, A DIKE IS<br>
REQUIRED SURROUNDING THE ENTIRE LOCATION. This well is located on an aquifer: An onsite inspection is<br>
required. Contact NDIC Field Inspector for site specific stipulations to include but not limited to: Closed Mud System, no<br>
drilling pit, and impermeable liner is required on the entire location and a string of casing must be placed in the rat and mouse<br>
hole and cemented to ground level. Furthermore, the operator must take into consideration the production facility when<br>
placing the liner on location. WPX ENERGY WILLISTON LLC must contact NDIC Field Inspector Robert Garbe at 701-720-<br>
3262 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion<br>
operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and<br>
freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized<br>
representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director<br>
prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The proposed directional<br>
plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 54'N and<br>
12029'E.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit<br>
on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following<br>
publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn<br>
affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and<br>
any other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit,<br>
the applicant should retain the permit.<br>
Permit Fee &amp; Notification<br>
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given immediately upon the<br>
spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil &amp; Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information<br>
must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.<br>
Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a<br>
message if after hours or on the weekend.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a certified<br>
copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or<br>
in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the<br>
survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one<br>
adobe document, with a certification cover page to </span><span class="ft2">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90<br>
feet in the lateral.<br>
Confidential status<br>
Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is hereby granted. Such<br>
information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing on the date the well is spud.<br>
Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well records wherever located.<br>
Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall permit the Director and his representatives to come<br>
upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and<br>
operation of such wells and to have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect<br>
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time upon request. The<br>
information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and shall be available only to the Commission and<br>
its staff.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement<br>
utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones<br>
can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the<br>
presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production<br>
or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as<br>
one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a<br>
standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft2">digitallogs@nd.gov </span><span class="ft0">Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>

A mud test shall be performed every 24 hours after mudding up to determine as<br>
applicable density, viscosity, gel strength, filtration, and pH.<br>
b.<br>
Mud monitoring equipment to be used is as follows:<br>
1) Periodic checks will be made each tour of the mud system. The<br>
mud level will be checked visually.<br>
2) The minimum quantity of mud material to be kept on location, in<br>
case of an emergency, is 700 Bbls.<br>
3) The concentration of hazardous substances in the reserve pit at<br>
the time of pit backfilling must not exceed the standards set<br>

PROPOSED TESTING, LOGGING, AND CORING<br>
The anticipated type and amount of testing, logging and coring are as follows:<br>
a.<br>
No drill stem tests are planned. However, if they are run the<br>
following guidelines should be adhered to:<br>
A DST that flows to the surface with evidence of hydrocarbons shall<br>
be either reversed out of the testing string under controlled surface<br>
conditions, or displaced into the formation prior to pulling the test<br>
tool. This would involve providing some means for reverse<br>
circulation. Separation equipment required for the anticipated<br>
recovery shall be properly installed before a test starts.<br>
All engines within 100 feet of the wellbore that are required to &quot;run"<br>
during the test shall have spark arresters or water cooled exhausts.<br>
The logging program will consist of: an SLB Platform Express and<br>
GPIT to be run at kick off point (continuous directional survey).<br>
b.<br>
The logging program will consist of: an MWD; CBL; Casing<br>
Inspection, Gamma and CCL combined.<br>
c.<br>
No cores are anticipated.<br>
d.<br>
The anticipated completion program is as follows: After drilling the<br>
Bakken lateral, a 4-1/2" production liner with multiple packers or<br>
cemented liner for isolation will be run from KOP inside the 7"<br>
intermediate casing out to the lateral TD.<br>
e.<br>
Cement Bond Logs (CBL) will be run prior to performing frac<br>
stimulation.<br>

Section 102 (b) (3) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management<br>
Act of 1982, as implemented by the applicable provision of the<br>
operating regulations at Title 43 CFR 3162.4-1, requires that "not<br>
later than the 5th business day after any well begins production on<br>
which royalty is due anywhere on the lease site or allocated to a<br>
lease site, or resumes production in the case of a well which has<br>
been off production for more than 90 days, the operator shall notify<br>
the authorized officer by letter or sundry notice, Form 3160-5 or<br>
orally to be followed by a letter or sundry notice of the date on<br>
which such production has begun or resumed." The date on which<br>
production is commenced or resumed will be construed for oil wells<br>
as the date on which liquid hydrocarbons are first sold or shipped<br>
from a temporary storage facility, such as a test tank, and for which a<br>
run ticket is required to be generated or, the date on which liquid<br>
hydrocarbons are first produced into a permanent storage facility,<br>
whichever first occurs; and, for gas sales as the date on which<br>
associated liquid hydrocarbons are first sold or shipped from a<br>
temporary storage facility, such as a test tank, and for which a run<br>
ticket is required to be generated or, the date on which gas is first<br>
measured through permanent metering facilities, whichever first<br>
occurs. If the operator fails to comply with these requirements in the<br>
manner and time allowed, the operator shall be liable for a civil<br>
penalty of up to $10,000 per violation for each day such violation<br>
continues, not to exceed a maximum of 20 days. See Section 109 (3) of<br>
the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 and the<br>
implementing regulations at Title 43 CFR 3163.4.<br>
Notification Requirements:<br>

The following standards apply to the abandonment of newly drilled dry or<br>
nonproductive wells in accordance with 43 CFR 3162.3-4. Approval shall be<br>
obtained prior to the commencement of abandonment. All formations being<br>
useable quality water, oil, gas, or geothermal resources, and/or a prospectively<br>
valuable deposit of minerals shall be protected. Approval may be given orally by<br>
the authorized officer before abandonment operations are initiated. This oral<br>
request and approval shall be followed by a written notice of intent to abandon<br>
filed not later than the fifth business day following oral approval. Failure to<br>
obtain approval prior to commencement of abandonment operations shall result<br>
in immediate assessment under 43 CFR 3163.1 (b) (3). The hole shall be in static<br>
condition at the time any plugs are placed (this does not pertain to plugging lost<br>

2. A detailed gas gathering pipeline system location map which depicts the following information.<br>
a. Name and location of the destination processing<br>
Robinson Lake Gas Plant<br>
plant.<br>
b. Name of gas gatherer and location of lines for each<br>
Van Hook Gathering System<br>
gas gatherer in the map vicinity.<br>
("VHGS") operated by WPX energy,<br>
LLC to the Whiting CDP. Whiting<br>
will be the transporter to the Robinson<br>
Lake Gas Plant.<br>
c. </span><span class="ft4">The proposed route and tie-in point to connect the subject<br>

well to an existing gas line<br>
3. Information on the existing line, to which operator proposes to connect to, including:<br>
a. Maximum current daily capacity of the existing gas<br>
Designed capacity is 13 MMSCFD<br>
line<br>
b. Current throughput of the existing gas line<br>
7.2 MMSCFD<br>
c. Anticipated daily capacity of existing gas line at date 13 MMSCFD<br>
of first gas sales<br>
d. Anticipated throughput of existing gas line at date of<br>
10 MMSCFD<br>
first gas sales<br>
e. Gas gatherer issues or expansion plans for the area (if An extension of the VHGS is planned<br>
known).<br>
for the east side of Sections 12 &amp; 1<br>
(T150N-R92W) and the north side of<br>
Section 1, which will allow additional<br>
capacity on the line. An 8" poly line<br>
will be installed. A map of the current<br>
and proposed gathering line is<br>
attached.<br>
.<br>
4. A detailed flowback strategy including:<br>
a. Anticipated date of first production<br>
Wells are scheduled to be batch drilled<br>
with consecutive development of the<br>
Unit beginning July 2015. First<br>
production will be approximately 30<br>
days after completion of drilling<br>
operations on a given batch.<br>
Production facilities are typically<br>
installed prior to drilling operations so<br>
flowback gas and oil are captured and<br>
sold at that time.<br>
b. Anticipated oil and gas rates and duration. If well is<br>
90 day average production by pad:<br>
on a multi-well pad, include total for all wells being<br>
completed<br>

1.1.1<br>
Air Quality Best Management Practices<br>
Under the CAA, federal land management agencies have an affirmative responsibility to protect<br>
air quality. Tribes, federal land managers, and private entities can make emission controls part of<br>
a lease agreement. BMPs can be adopted for various portions of an oil/gas well's lifecycle.<br>
BMPs fall into the following six general categories.<br>
· </span><span class="ft3">Transportation BMPs to reduce the amount of fugitive dust and vehicle emissions<br>
o<br>
Use directional drilling to drill multiple wells from a single well pad;<br>
o<br>
use centralized water storage and delivery, well fracturing, gathering systems;<br>
o<br>
use telemetry to remotely monitor and control production;<br>
o<br>
use water or dust suppressants to control fugitive dust on roads;<br>
o<br>
control road speeds; and<br>
o<br>
use van or carpooling.<br>
· </span><span class="ft3">Drilling BMPs to reduce rig emissions<br>
o<br>
Use cleaner diesel (Tier 2, 3, and 4) engines;<br>
o<br>
use natural gas-powered engines; and<br>
o<br>
use "green" completions to recapture product that otherwise would have been vented or<br>
flared.<br>
· </span><span class="ft3">Unplanned or emergency releases<br>
o<br>
Use high-temperature flaring if gas is not recoverable.<br>
· </span><span class="ft3">Vapor recovery<br>
o<br>
Use enclosed tanks instead of open pits to reduce fugitive VOC emissions; and<br>
o<br>
use vapor recovery units on storage tanks.<br>
· </span><span class="ft3">Inspection and maintenance<br>
o<br>
Use and maintain proper hatches, seals, and valves;<br>
o<br>
optimize glycol circulation and install a flash tank separator;<br>
o<br>
use selective catalytic reduction; and<br>
o<br>
replace high-bleed with low-bleed devices on pneumatic pumps.<br>
· </span><span class="ft3">Monitoring and repair<br>
o<br>
Use directed inspection and maintenance methods to identify and cost-effectively fix<br>
fugitive gas leaks; and<br>
o<br>
install an air quality monitoring station.<br>
<hr>
<A name=54></a>1.1.2<br>
General BMPs<br>
Although largely project-specific, there are a number of BMPs that can, and should, be<br>
considered on development projects in general. The following are examples of general BMPs.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Planning roads and facility sites to minimize visual impacts.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Using existing roads to the extent possible, upgrading as needed.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Reducing the size of facility sites and types of roads to minimize surface disturbance.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Minimizing topsoil removal.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Stockpiling stripped topsoil and protecting it from erosion, by reseeding with native<br>
grasses, until reclamation activities commence. At that time, the soil would be<br>
redistributed and reseeded on the disturbed areas. The reclaimed areas would be protected<br>
and maintained until the sites are fully stabilized.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Avoiding removal of, and damage to, trees, shrubs, and groundcover where possible.<br>
Trees near construction areas would be marked clearly to ensure that they are not<br>
removed.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Mowing, instead of clearing, a facility or well site to accommodate vehicles or<br>
equipment.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Maintaining buffer strips or using other sediment control measures to avoid sediment<br>
migration to stream channels as a result of construction activities.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Planning for erosion control.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Storing chemicals properly (including secondary containment).<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Keeping sites clean, including containing trash in a portable trash cage. The trash cage<br>
would be emptied at a state-approved sanitary landfill.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Conducting snow removal activities in a manner that does not adversely impact reclaimed<br>
areas and areas adjacent to reclaimed areas.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Avoiding or minimizing topographic alterations, activities on steep slopes, and<br>
disturbances within stream channels and floodplains to the extent possible.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Maintaining buffers around work areas where there is a risk of fire as a result of<br>
construction activities.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Keeping fire extinguishers in all vehicles.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Planning transportation to reduce vehicle density.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Posting speed limits on roads.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Avoiding traveling during wet conditions that could result in excessive rutting.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Painting facilities a color that would blend with the environment.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Practicing dust abatement on roads.<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">Recontouring disturbed areas to approximate the original contours of the landscape.<br>
<hr>
<A name=55></a>· </span><span class="ft2">Developing a final reclamation plan that allows disturbed areas to be quickly absorbed<br>
into the natural landscape.<br>
WPX Energy recognizes that there are several BMPs that can be used to mitigate environmental<br>
concerns specific to projects associated with below-ground linear alignments, such as those<br>
included in the proposed utility corridor. These include:<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">following the contour (form and line) of the landscape;<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">avoiding locating ROWs on steep slopes;<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">sharing common ROWs;<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">co-locating multiple lines in the same trench; and<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">using natural (topography, vegetation) or artificial (berms) features to help screen<br>
facilities such as valves and metering stations.<br>
WPX Energy would implement these and/or other BMPs to the extent that they are technically<br>
feasible and would add strategic and measurable protection to the project area.<br>
1.1.3<br>
Mitigation and Safety Measures Committed to by WPX Energy<br>
1.1.3.1<br>
Dust Control<br>
During construction, a watering truck may be kept on site and the access road would be watered<br>
as necessary, especially during periods of high winds and/or low precipitation.<br>
1.1.3.2<br>
Utility Lines<br>
All utility lines, including electric lines and other lines essential to oil well operations, would be<br>
installed underground.<br>
1.1.3.3<br>
Fire Control<br>
WPX Energy would implement fire prevention and control measures including, but not limited<br>
to:<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">requiring construction crews to carry fire extinguishers in their vehicles and/or<br>
equipment;<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">training construction crews in the proper use of fire extinguishers; and<br>
· </span><span class="ft2">contracting with the local fire district to provide fire protection.<br>
1.1.3.4<br>
Traffic<br>
Construction personnel would stay within the approved ROW or would follow designated access<br>
roads.<br>
1.1.3.5<br>
Closed-Loop System<br>
WPX Energy commits to using a closed-loop system for the dual well pad location.<br>
<hr>
<A name=56></a>1.1.3.6<br>
Wildlife<br>
During an informal Section 7 consultation with the USFWS, the following mitigation measures<br>
were agreed upon to reduce the potential impact to protected species.<br>
1.1.3.6.1<br>
Bald and Golden Eagle and Migratory Bird Protective Measures<br>
· </span><span class="ft0">SWCA biologists conducted a 0.5 mile line-of-sight survey for eagle individuals and<br>
nests during their on-site environmental survey. No eagles or nests were observed within<br>
0.5 mile of the proposed project area.<br>
· </span><span class="ft0">WPX Energy would conduct all construction outside of the migratory bird breeding<br>
season (between February 1 and July 15); or, if construction occurs during bird breeding<br>
season, WPX Energy would either:<br>
o<br>
mow and maintain vegetation within the project construction area (access road<br>
and well pad), weather permitting, prior to and during the breeding season to deter<br>
migratory birds from nesting in the project area until construction is underway; or<br>
o<br>
conduct an avian survey of the project area five days before construction begins, and if<br>
nests are discovered, notify BIA and USFWS.<br>
1.1.3.6.2<br>
ESA Protective Measures<br>
· </span><span class="ft0">Piping Plover and its Designated Critical Habitat, Interior Least Tern, and Pallid<br>
Sturgeon: A 4-foot berm, which would hold 110% of the capacity of the largest tank plus<br>
one full day's production, would be placed around the location to prevent any accidental<br>
release of drilling fluids or hazardous materials into the watersheds of Lake Sakakawea.<br>
Migratory bird protective measures would be enforced.<br>
· </span><span class="ft0">Whooping Crane: If a whooping crane is sighted within 1 mile of the proposed project<br>
area, work will be stopped and the BIA and USFWS will be notified. In coordination<br>
with the USFWS, work may resume after the bird(s) leaves the area.<br>
It is the opinion of the USFWS that WPX Energy 's commitment to implement the avoidance<br>
measures described above demonstrates compliance with the ESA, MBTA, and BGEPA. Copies<br>
of the USFWS letters resulting from the informal section 7 consultation are provided in<br>
Appendix B.<br>
1.1.3.7<br>
Cultural Resources<br>
WPX Energy recognizes the need to protect cultural resources on the project locations and has<br>
committed to the following.<br>
· </span><span class="ft0">Prohibiting all project workers from collecting artifacts or disturbing cultural resources in<br>
any area under any circumstances.<br>
· </span><span class="ft0">Avoiding impacts to National Register-eligible or unevaluated cultural resources on well<br>
sites and access roads. If cultural resources are discovered during construction or<br>
operation, work shall immediately be stopped, the affected site be secured, and BIA and<br>
THPO notified. In the event of a discovery, work shall not resume until written<br>
authorization to proceed has been received from the BIA.<br>
<hr>
<A name=57></a>WPX Energy is committed to using BMPs to mitigate the potential effects of erosion. BMPs<br>
would include implementing erosion and sedimentation control measures, such as installing<br>

Executed Variance Request_Stink Gun Unit.pdf<br>
Hi Alice-<br>
Yes and Yes.<br>
TAT Location Variance/Exception<br>
Please see the attached executed variance request. This applies to both the Owl Comes Out 8-9H<br>
pad and the Stink Gun 8-9H pad. These pads will produce off of the Van Hook Production Pad. We<br>
do not need a variance for the production pad itself since a production pad outside the .5 mile was<br>
required.<br>
The production pad is consented over 50%. We're waiting on FONSI plus 30 day comment period.<br>
Looks like October 20th for FONSI.<br>
Federal Minerals<br>
BLM APDS were submitted on 9/26 (both pads). This is noted in the comments on NDIC APDs. It's<br>
really, really small!<br>
Let me know if you need anything else.<br>
Thanks,<br>
Deb<br>

Good afternoon Deb,<br>
These wells are located less than a half mile from Lake Sakakawea. Does the Reservation have any<br>
concerns with them being so close? Also, since the laterals will penetrate BLM minerals has WPX<br>
requested the necessary BLM permits?<br>
Thanks,<br>
Alice<br>

DETAILS OF WORK<br>
EOG Resources, Inc. requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-55. EOG Resources, Inc. intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set<br>
surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth<br>
pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the<br>
drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical<br>
seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of<br>
drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing<br>
plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance<br>
with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings<br>
and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not<br>
intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with<br>
acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. EOG Resources, Inc. understands<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced<br>
immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 &amp; 19.1). EOG Resources, Inc.<br>
will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days<br>
after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.<br>
EOG must notify NDIC Field Inspector Jason Hicks at 701-720-3523 with spud and TD.<br>

NWNW Section 29-158N-90W<br>
Mountrail County<br>
Well File # 30592<br>
Dear Beau:<br>
Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23605, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval<br>
is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the </span><span class="ft3">200' setback<br>
from the north &amp; south boundaries and </span><span class="ft3">500' setback </span><span class="ft1">from the east &amp; west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit<br>
consisting of Sections 29 &amp; 32, T158N-R90W.<br>
PERMIT STIPULATIONS: EOG RESOURCES, INC. must take into consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28<br>
(Safety Regulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned location. Pursuant<br>
to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) "No boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be<br>
placed nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank." Due to surficial water adjacent to the well site,<br>
a dike is required surrounding the entire location. EOG may set conductor on permitted wells only.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be<br>
maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out,<br>
completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. EOG RESOURCES INC must<br>
contact NDIC Field Inspector Jason Hicks at 701-720-3523 prior to location construction.<br>
Drilling pit<br>
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that "a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling<br>
and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent<br>
pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are<br>
prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill<br>
cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit."<br>
Form 1 Changes &amp; Hard Lines<br>
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The<br>
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal<br>
coordinate from the well head is: 10169 S.<br>
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)<br>
Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the<br>
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to<br>
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be<br>
waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to<br>
evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that<br>
would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the<br>
applicant should retain the permit.<br>

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall<br>
file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be<br>
submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the<br>
directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the<br>
director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a<br>
certification cover page to </span><span class="ft3">certsurvey@nd.gov</span><span class="ft0">.<br>
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.<br>
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or<br>
when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.<br>
Surface casing cement<br>
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours,<br>
and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the<br>
plug or initiating tests.<br>
Logs<br>
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and<br>
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well<br>
bore, and (3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic<br>
cement evaluation log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior<br>
to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format)<br>
copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or<br>
attached to an email sent to </span><span class="ft3">digitallogs@nd.gov<br>

RE:<br>
Filter Socks and Other Filter Media<br>
Leakproof Container Required<br>
Oil and Gas Wells<br>
Dear Operator,<br>
North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with<br>
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all<br>
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.<br>
Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very<br>
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.<br>
Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the<br>
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations<br>
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an<br>
authorized facility. Such containers must be:<br>
 leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container<br>
 covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container<br>
 placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container<br>
If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but<br>
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.<br>
As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01<br>
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production<br>
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste<br>
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the<br>
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,<br>
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.<br>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bruce E. Hicks<br>

higher than expected pressures are encountered<br>
Production Liner:<br>
The 4-1/2&quot; production liner is 11.6 lb/ft, Grade HCP-110 with LT&amp;C connections. The liner is run to<br>
within 10' of total depth of the lateral and the liner hanger is set at the Kick Off Point of the lateral. The<br>
liner will be cemented from TD to the liner hanger and completed using plug &amp; perf techniques with<br>
intervals of approximately 200' - 250'.<br>
Per Fish &amp; Wildlife:<br>
The proposed Sidonia 56-2932H is located within a Fish &amp; Wildlife easement; however disturbance<br>
activities do not encroach on USFWS conservation features<br>
Other Notes:<br>
The current permitting package includes the Sidonia 56, and 110-2932H. The plat package includes six<br>
additional wells that will not be drilled at this time, but are included in the plat package to allow for future<br>
expansion.<br>

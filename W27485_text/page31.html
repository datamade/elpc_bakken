Monthly downtime will be monitored for all commingled wells to determine the total number of producing hours for each well. <br/>Oil Continuous Metering: Individual Well "Allocated Monthly Well OIL SALES": 1. Volumes of oil will be metered at a dedicated treater (at central facility) using coriolis meters. 2. The total oil volume leaving the central production facility will be metered by LACT unit prior to trucking oil or entry into an oil gathering pipeline system. a. LACT metered oil volumes for the month are termed "Actual Monthly Oil Sales". 3. Determine a theoretical monthly oil production volume for each continuously metered well as <br/>follows: <br/>a Thanrnfirnl kllnnfhlu nil Drndnrfinn - Tn+al nil nnlnmn rnnfinunnclu moi-aran fnr : </p>

LACT ships less than 2,000 bbls in a month: LACT is proved every quarter. <br/>3. in addition, to establish a comparative meter factor for a new LACT, the initial proving is followed by a second proving a month later, regardless of how much oil is shipped through the LACT for that month. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">At the start of this section the bit was at the top of the target zone in the dirtier gamma. The bit remained here following overall dip trend until 13,000’ MD. At this point the gamma started to show a signature different than seen before but at 13,260’ changed again and appeared to be the same as what was being seen in the top part of target zone. At 13,450’ a gamma change was seen and it was thought that we were seeing a change in formation and were following dip. At 13,580’ MD the MWD tool failed and a trip was made to replace it. Following the trip, drilling resumed with a similar gamma signature being seen. Due to this gamma remaining so consistent it was believed that we were following dip until seeing an unexpected gamma heat up at 13,970’ MD that indicated the upper shale. This was very unexpected as none of the gamma seen in the previous 500’ of drilling showed what normally would have been seen in this part of zone. Decision was made to pull back to 12,940’ MD to begin a sidetrack. BHL of lateral 1 was 62.91 ’ FSL & 1,986.44 FWL of Section 13, T159N, and R96W. <br/>This section showed similar gas and oil shows as the previous section with an increase as the bit traversed up and through the target zone. The trip at 13,580’ MD had a gas show of 5,065 <br/>units of gas with 100% coverage of green oil. Refer to chart below to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. </p>

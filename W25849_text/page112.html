    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Estimated dip continued at 90.57 degrees. The MWD pulser failed while drilling ahead at 16,307 feet measured depth on the morning of the 16TH of January, 2015. An additional full stand was drilled in an attempt to correct the problem, but was unsuccessful. A trip was performed beginning at 4:00 AM CST on January 16, 2015, and bit number seven, a Baker T307, new mud motor, and MWD tools were picked up and tripped in the hole. The trip was completed at 7:00 PM CST on January 16, 2015. While preparing to return to lateral drilling, the new MWD pulser also failed. One additional joint was drilled in attempt to ﬁx the pulser, but was <br/>unsuccessful. Aﬁer circulating bottoms up and pumping a pill, began trip for failed MWD again at 10:00 PM CST on January 16,2015. <br/>As of morning report on the morning of the 17TH of January, a new MWD assembly was picked up, and had just begun tripping in. The trip was completed shortly after 2:00 PM CST. The missing gamma and surveys were re-logged and taken. Lateral drilling resumed shortly before 3:00 PM CST, with drill rates while rotating averaging between 390 and 410 feet per hour. A trip gas of 3,755 units was circulated with bottoms up. Background gas dropped to an average of 1,580 units. The wellbore remained at, or just above the top of the target window for the duration of the drilling day, with a continuation of the downward slides being countered by upward deﬂections. Estimated dip rate was decreased to 90.17 degrees, and the wellbore was just inside the top of the target window as of morning report. <br/>Through the morning of the 18TH of January, 2015, lateral drilling continued, with drill rates averaging between 350 and 380 feet per hour while rotating, and 40 to 60 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 1,332 units. Upward deﬂections continued, keeping the wellbore at or just above the top of the target window for the duration of the drilling day. Though no correlative markers were observed, the dip rate was increased to 90.57 degrees. The wellbore was just slightly above the top of the target window at lateral TD. <br/>The Knife Elsie Bartleson Federal #14—16 Three Forks cross section lateral number one reached a total depth of 20,150 feet measured depth within clean gamma sandstone shortly before 6:30 PM CST on Sunday, January 18”, 2015, 18 days from spud, at 1,944 feet from the north line, and 270 feet from the east line of the SE SE ‘/4 of Section 33, Township 153N, Range 92W, Mountrail County, North Dakota. </p>

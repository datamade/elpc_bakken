    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Three Forks 10,612 ’ MD 10,442 ’ TVD -8,35 7’ SS <br/>The Three Forks was picked at 10,612 feet measured depth, 10,442 feet true vertical depth, marked by a decrease in drill rates and transition in samples from the black carbonaceous sub blocky shale of the Lower Bakken to a light to medium gray, blue gray, greenish gray, slightly calcareous, platy to rare blocky, smooth to gritty, hard, silty in part shale. Sandstone, dolomite, and siltstone stringers interbedded and interlaminated through the upper Three Forks. Background gas averaged 150 to 200 units through the end of the curve. <br/>The curve was landed at 10,770 feet driller’s measured depth, and a projected 10,468.63 feet true vertical depth, approximately 27 feet within the Three Forks shortly before 2:00 AM CST on January 12“, 2015. <br/>Lateral 1 0, 770’ —— 20,150 ’ MD <br/>Seven inch casing was run and set at 10,755 feet measured depth. On the evening of the l3TH of January, 2015, bit number six, a Baker T307 and directional tools were picked up and tripped in the hole. Aﬁer drilling cement and pressure testing casing, the lateral section of the wellbore began drilling ahead shortly before 11:00 PM CST. <br/>The Sanish ﬁeld targeting methodology was used for the duration of the lateral wellbore. A 37 foot total targeting window was used, with the top of the window initially set at the top of the Three Forks at 10,456 feet true vertical depth and 10,612 feet measured depth, and projected out at the anticipated over all dip rate of 90.55 degrees. An internal further targeting window was set between 10 and 25 feet below the top of the window, with the bottom of the window set 37 feet below the top. The observed dip rate of the lateral was initially shallower than anticipated over the ﬁrst 2,500 feet, averaging between 90.23 and 90.46 degrees, increasing again to 90.57 degrees for the following 4,500 feet, decreasing again to 90.17 for the ﬁnal 2,000 feet. <br/>Lateral drilling began shortly before 11:00 PM CST on the evening of the 13TH of January, 2015. Drill rates while rotating averaged between 180 and 200 feet per hour, and from 40 to 60 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas initially averaged 70 units. The wellbore remained near the top of the target window with an estimated dip rate of 90.5 degrees through the ﬁrst morning of drilling. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Through the drilling day of the 14TH of January, drill rates while rotating averaged between 250 and 300 feet per hour, an from 40 to 60 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 441 units. No signiﬁcant correlative markers were observed through 12,900 feet measured depth, indicating a ﬂatter than anticipated dip rate. Following 12,900 feet measured depth, correlative gamma markers indicated a dip rate of near 90.65 degrees. The wellbore descended through the target window, and remained near the base of the window through the morning of the 15TH of January. <br/>The drilling day of the 15TH of January, 2015 saw drill rates continuing to average between 270 and 300 feet per hour while rotating, and from 50 to 70 feet per hour while sliding. Background gas averaged 751 units. The wellbore remained near the base of the target window through 14,600 feet measured depth, when it began to ascend through the target window. The wellbore exited the top of the window following 15,070 feet measured depth, and remained above the window for the duration of the drilling day. Multiple slides were implemented to return the wellbore to the target window, but were countered by continual upward deﬂections. </p>

Water will continue to be measured via meters and a comingled tank battery. <br/>Prior to LACT installation, oil will be sold through dedicated tanks and dedicated truck run tickets. <br/>1. The meter factor will represent the most recent valid meter factor based on quarterly master meter or tank proving. <br/>2. Measured daily well volume will be the measured oil volume that is delivered to the commingled tank battery, as recorded by the dedicated well coriolis meter, times the meter <br/>factor. Measurement will be done continuously. Meter data will be stored and archived. <br/>3. Measured monthly well volumes will represent the sum of the prior months measured daily well volumes. <br/>4. The mea5ured monthly pad volume will represent the sum of the measured monthly well volumes from each well on the pad. <br/>5. The custody transfer pad volume will represent the actual volume sold through run tickets. <br/>6. The monthly well sales volume will be calculated by multiplying the custody transfer pad <br/>volume times the measured monthly well volume divided by the measured monthly pad volume. <br/>Prior to LACT installation, the water volume per well will be calculated as follows: <br/>1. Measured daily well volume will be the measured water volume that is delivered to the commingled tank battery, as recorded by the dedicated well meter. Measurement will be done continuously. Meter data will be stored and archived. <br/>2. Measured monthly well volumes will represent the sum of the prior months measured daily well volumes. <br/>3. The measured monthly pad volume will represent the sum of the measured monthly well volumes from each well on the pad. <br/>4. The custody transfer pad volume will represent the sum of the actual volume removed from location via truck run tickets for the entire production month. <br/>5. The monthly well expense volume will be calculated by multiplying the custody transfer pad <br/>volume times the measured monthly well volume divided by the measured monthly pad volume. <br/>6. Well expense will be calculated based on the monthly well expense volume. <br/>After LACT installation, oil sales volume per well will be calculated as follows: <br/>  </p>

The Wisness 150-100-23—14-11TFH well spudded October 12th, 2014, and reached a <br/>total depth of 21,200’ MD on October 29, 2014. </p>

The gas detection system used was Neset Total Gas. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected in the vertical section and curve. Fiﬁy foot samples were collected in the horizontal. All lagged samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the <br/>North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Vertical 8,800 —- 1 0,6 72’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 8,800 feet measured depth in the Kibbey Formation on October 15th, 2014. Drill rates ranged ﬁom 0.4 to 6.6 minutes per foot. Gas ranged ﬁom <br/>11 to 292 units. Charles 8,860’ MD 8,858’ TVD -6,539’SS <br/>The Charles formation was encountered at 8,860’ MD; 8,858’ TVD and was picked due to an increase in ROP related to the Charles Salt, mixed with anhydrite. Samples consisted of a mix of Salt, Anhydrite, and Limestone. Sample characteristics showed clear, angular, crystalline, translucent, moderate anhydrite, rusty brown to orange, off white to cream white, trace limestone, white mineral to dull yellow ﬂuorescence, and no cut. </p>

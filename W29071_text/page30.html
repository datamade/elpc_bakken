Slides were put in to complete this turn until 11, 147’ MD. Drilling would continue in the middle portion of the target window with a drop being seen at 11,766’ MD. A high side slides was put in at 11,959’ MD to counter this drop. A downslide was put in at 12,031’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. <br/>The wellbore would continue dropping from this point into the lower portion of the target window. A high side slide was put in at 12,482’ MD to prevent the continue drop in rotation. A second high side slide was put in at 12,670’ MD to bring the wellbore back up into the upper portion of the target window. </p>

A downslide was put in at 14, 706’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. <br/>The wellbore would allowed to drop gradually in the formation into the lower portion of the target window until a high side slide was put in at 15,989’ MD and 16,087’ MD to bring the wellbore back up in the formation. These slides would send the wellbore into the upper portion of the target window. <br/>A downslide was put in at 16,615’ MD to prevent this continued rise in the wellbore. This slide would send the wellbore dropping in the formation. A high side slide was put in at 17,038’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. <br/>Drilling would continue in what was thought to be the upper portion of the target window until a downslide was put in at 19,218’ MD to prevent the continued rise in the wellbore. This slide would send the wellbore down into the Lower Bakken Shale. This <br/>encounter with the LBS would indicate a signiﬁcant ﬂattening in the formation to 89.71 degrees. <br/>TD was called at 19,632’ MD at 11:00 PM CDT on Sunday, December 21, 2014. </p>

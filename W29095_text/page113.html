The Middle Bakken in this area is about forty ﬁve feet thick and consists of a silty sandstone which is medium to dark gray, light gray, brown in part, platy, granular, ﬁrm to soft, subangular, moderately argillaceous, medium induration, limestone cementation, dolomitic, trace micrite, <br/>sucrosic on edges, samples had bright yellow ﬂuorescence, and instant milky streaming yellow cut. <br/>Lower Bakken 10,991 ’ MD 10,879 ’ T VD 8, 770’ SS <br/>The Lower Bakken was entered at 10,879’ TVD. Upon entering the Upper Bakken shale gas raised in excess of 2088 total units. Background gas was consistently from 1200 to 2000 units in the package. A typical sample was shale, black, very dark gray, gray, dark brown, brown, ﬁrm to brittle, ﬁssile, massive, carbonaceous, waxy, <br/>earthy, scattered bright yellow ﬂuorescence, milky yellow cut. The Lower Bakken shale was thirty feet thick. <br/>Three Forks 11, 069’ MD 10,909’ T VD 8,800’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">At 10,909’ TVD the Three Forks was encountered. This top was picked from both lithology and gamma changes. The upper portion of the Three Forks exhibited dolomite that was light gray, gray tan, tan, slightly argillaceous, limestone in part, microcrystalline, moderate intergranular porosity, abundant silt, with scattered yellow ﬂuorescence, fast streaming yellow-green milky cut. Lower into the zone we encountered a light gray limy dolomite that had slightly larger crystals which slowed ROP and made sliding more difﬁcult. There was also a noticeable increase in ﬁne grained quartz siltstone. Fluorescence in this area was more abundant, even bright yellow and bright green. Cuts from this area in zone were thick and bright, often streaming from the reservoir rock. Pyrite became more abundant in the upper part of the zone, and was also seen in abundance just below the Lower Bakken. Gas in the upper Three Forks ranged from 112 units to 3000 units and up to 9000 total units while tripping. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The P Vance 154-97—14-9-21-14H3 reached a total measured depth of 22,061 ’ MD on January 30, 2015, at 3:30 PM CDT. Formation dip began downward ranging 89.5 to 89.8 degrees coming right out of the lateral casing shoe to 88.8 degrees at 13,000’ MD. From 13,500’ MD to 15,500’ MD, the formation continued downward averaging an <br/>approximate 89.43 degree dip. From 16,000’ MD until 19,500’ MD formation came down hard ranging from 88.9 to 89.9 degrees. Aﬁer 19,500’ MD formation took an </p>

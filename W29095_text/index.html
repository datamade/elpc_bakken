The best porosity and oil shows came immediately above the clean gamma marker at the center of the target window. Yellow green to green brown oil was often present on the shakers while in this zone, gas was also elevated which was another way of indicating where we were in zone. We found that entering the target window from the bottom, at an angle close to the approximated formation dip would allow the bit to track formation easier.

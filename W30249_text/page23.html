    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Day 5 16,950’—20,178’MD <br/>Drilling continued with the wellbore dropping in TVD through the A/C contact giving the formation a calculated dip rate of 89.4 degrees. The wellbore continued to track the cooler gamma in the lower portion of the target before building in TVD around 905 to 90.5 degrees. As the C/A transition was seen slides were done and the wellbore rolled over and began dropping slowly back through the C faces repeat giving the formation a calculated dip rate of 89.8 degrees. The wellbore throughout the day continued to track the A/C faces contact before dropping slowly in TVD about one or two feet below the target window seeing the warmer ratty gamma below the target with slides done to work on keeping the wellbore at or slightly above dip of 89.3 degrees. The wellbore continued to track the lower portion of the target to TD of the North West lateral. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 200 - 250 ﬁ/hr while rotating. Background gases averaged around 400 — 700 units with connection gases reaching as high as 1,308 units. The samples seen throughout the day continued to exhibit a cream tan/cream gray tan sandstone with traces of limestone and siltstone present and an even yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. </p>

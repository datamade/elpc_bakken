The samples seen throughout the lower portion of the Middle Bakken exhibited a cream gray tan/gray tan sandstone with an even to spotty yellow green ﬂuorescence and an instant streaming to milky yellow green cut. <br/>Day 3 12,450’ —15,750’MD <br/>Drilling continued with the wellbore dropping in TVD through the target window at around 87 degrees and exiting the base of the Middle Bakken target interval reaching about ten feet below the base of the target window. Aﬁer putting in slides to slow the drop of the wellbore the wellbore began to head back up section in TVD into the target window seeing the C transition in gamma. After seeing the repeat in cool gamma from the C faces the new calculated dip rate was set at 89.15 degrees. The wellbore continued to slowly build in TVD through the target window seeing the C to A faces contact with the gamma heating up to around 100 — 120 API. Slides were done aﬁer seeing this and th wellbore was leveled out about six feet above the top of the Middle Bakken target window. As the wellbore was rolled over and began to drop in TVD back into the lower portion of the target interval the repeat in A to C contact indicated that the formation had ﬂattened from the previous 89.15 degrees to 89.9 degrees. As the wellbore continued to track the set line of the A to C faces contact the formation steepened to a calculated dip rate of 89.4 degrees. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 200 — 250 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 50 - 70 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 500 — 700 units with connection gases reaching as high as 2,615 units. The samples seen throughout the day continued to exhibit a cream tan/cream gray tan sandstone with traces of limestone and siltstone present and an even to spotty sometimes dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and an instant streaming to milky yellow green cut. <br/>Day 4 15, 750’ — 16,950’MD <br/>Drilling continued with the wellbore steadily tracking the A to C contact. After a slightly ﬂat section of 89.9 degrees from 15,000’ to 15,500’ MD the formation steepened up to 89.3 and then 89.4 degrees. Drilling continued through the lower portion of the Middle Bakken target interval up to a MD of 16,455’ where pressure problems were experienced and MWD began to have problems decoding gamma. After seeing this along with slow penetration rates the decision was made to TOOH. After ﬁnishing the TOOH a new Bit and Mud Motor were picked up and the TlH began. After getting on bottom drilling resumed with trip gases reaching as high as 3,906 units. As the drilling continued the wellbore continued to slowly build in TVD and the warm gamma from the A faces was seen indicating that the formation had ﬂattened from 89.4 to 89.8 degrees. After reaching about three feet above the three foot set line the wellbore rolled over and began dropping in section back through the A to C contact with the new calculated dip rate set at 89.5 degrees. Penetration rates with the new assembly averaged around 200 - 250 ﬁ/hr while rotating. Background gases averaged around 400 — 700 units with connection gases reaching as high as 2,161 units. The samples seen throughout the day continued to exhibit a cream tan/cream gray tan sandstone with traces of limestone and siltstone present and </p>

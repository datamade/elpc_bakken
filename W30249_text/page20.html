Penetration rates slowed to around 12 — 15 ﬁ/hr and the decision was made at a MD of 10,047’ to TOOH. The TOOH was completed with a new 2.38 degree motor and Security bit picked up and began TlH. The TlH was completed and drilling resumed with the curve. The remainder of the Lodgepole formation was drilled out and the False Bakken was encountered. <br/>False Bakken 1 0, 088 ' MD 9, 924’ T VD - 7, 5 73 ’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 10,088’, true vertical depth of 9,924’, thirteen foot low to prognosis. After seeing the False Bakken top the TVD landing target remained at a true vertical depth of 9,972’ @ 90 degrees based off the isopaching from the False Bakken to the Middle Bakken target area in the offset Jones and Amdt wells. Penetration rates through the False Bakken averaged around 90 100 ft/hr while sliding. The lithology of the False Bakken exhibited a mixture of light to medium gray limestone and trace to moderate amounts of gray brown shale present. Background gases through the False Bakken increased to around 50 — 100 units. The False Bakken was evaluated while drilling ahead. <br/>Scallion 1 0,1 00 ’ MD 9, 928 ’ T VD - 7, 5 77’ SS </p>

Aﬂer seeing the Scallion top the TVD target window remained at a true vertical depth of 9,972’ @ 90 degrees based off the isopaching from the Scallion to the lVIiddle Bakken target area in the offset Jones and Arndt wells. Penetration rates through the Scallion averaged around 100 - 110 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases in the Scallion increased to around 100 — 150 units with the samples showing a light to medium gray/cream gray tan limestone with moderate dark gray to black shale present. The Scallion was drilled through from 9,928' to 9,946’ true vertical depth. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 10,149’ MD 9, 946’ T VD -7,595 ’ SS <br/>The curve continued on through the remainder of the Scallion and the Upper Bakken formation was encountered at a measured depth of 10,149’, true vertical depth of 9,946’, ﬁfteen feet low to prognosis. Aﬁer seeing the Upper Bakken the TVD landing target was lowered from 9,972’ to 9,973’ TVD. Once the Upper Bakken was encountered penetration rates increased to around 120 — 130 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases also increased to around 300 — 500 units through the Upper Bakken with the samples showing a black/gray brown black carbonaceous shale with occasional limestone present. The Upper Bakken was drilled through and the Middle Bakken was encountered next. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,202’ MD 9,960’ T VD -7,609’ SS </p>

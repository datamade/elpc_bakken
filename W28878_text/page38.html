A 16 degree turn was planned for the beginning of the lateral, necessitating a higher slide percentage. While sliding rate of penetration ranged from 0.08 to 2.3 minutes per foot and averaged 0.67 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 90 to 881 units and averaged 376 units. Gamma ranged from 77 to 125 API and averaged 101 API. Samples throughout the azimuth turn were generally described as sandstone: tan, brown, translucent, cream tan, ﬁne, subrounded, well sorted, poorly cemented, dolomitic cement; 40% shale, blue green, pyritic, ﬁssile; rare pyrite; fair porosity; scattered green ﬂuorescence, cloudy milky green fair streaming cut. <br/>At 10,955’ measured depth, the wellbore went out of the base of the target. The wellbore dropped in true vertical depth and bounced off the Aquitard at 11,150’. Gamma spiked to 162 API. Sliding succeeded in bringing the wellbore higher in true vertical depth. The clean gamma was encountered until about 11,530’ measured depth. The wellbore bounced off the Aquitard again. The second Aquitard encounter was used to estimate the dip to be 90.17 degrees, a slight updip. Samples below the base of the target window were generally described as a cream, off white sandstone with about 20% light green shale and about 5% light gray siltstone. The overall porosity was fair to poor. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">At 12,100’ measured depth the base of the target window was crossed and the dirty gamma was encountered. This contact point was used to estimate the dip to be 89.83 degrees. The wellbore continued to drill within the 9’ target window until 13,692’. In the interval from 12,100’ to 13,692’ the rate of penetration ranged from 0.13 to 2.63 minutes per foot and averaged 0.29 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 90 to 1274 units and averaged 604 units. Gamma ranged from 68 to 135 API and averaged 108 API. Samples in this interval were described as sandstone: cream, tan, cream tan, translucent, very ﬁne, subrounded, moderately sorted, poorly to moderately cemented, dolomitic cement; 5% shale, off white, light green, pyritic, ﬁssile; scattered pyrite; good porosity; scattered green ﬂuorescence, milky green fair streaming cut. <br/>At 13,692’ the clean gamma contact point was brieﬂy encountered at the top of the target window. The gamma reached a low of 63 API. Sliding succeeded in keeping the wellbore in the 9’ target. The clean gamma marker was used to estimate the dip to be 89.6 degrees. The wellbore continued to drill within the 9’ target window. The lower clean gamma contact was encountered at 15,110’ measured depth. This contact point was used to estimate the dip to be 89.7 degrees. In the interval from 13,692’ to 15,110’ the rate of penetration ranged from 0.13 to 1.5 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 84 to 1577 units and averaged 661 units. Gamma averaged 106 API. The samples were described as a light tan, cream sandstone with small percentages of shale and siltstone with good porosity. <br/>A trip was made at 16,698’ measured depth due to slow ROP. Anew bit and motor were picked up. Once back on bottom, trip gas spiked to 3749 units. The clean gamma was brieﬂy encountered again when the wellbore reached the top of the target window at 16,980’. The gamma reached a low of 63 API. This clean gamma marker was </p>

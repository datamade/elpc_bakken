The BLS came in 16’ low to <br/>prognosis. Samples below the last salt were dolomite and limestone with beds of anhydrite. <br/>Mission Canyon 8,824’ MD 8,819’ TVD -6,52 7’ SS <br/>The top of the Mission Canyon was picked using gamma markers found on offset logs. The Mission Canyon came in 24’ low to prognosis Rate of penetration ranged from 0.32 to 2.03 minutes per foot and averaged 0.73 minutes per foot. Samples from the upper Mission Canyon were majority cream gray limestone. Samples transitioned to cream tan dolomite in the last half of the Mission Canyon. Average porosity through the Mission Canyon was fair. Total gas ranged from 39 to 286 units and averaged 147 units. </p>

The Lodgepole came in 8’ high to prognosis. Drill rates in the Lodgepole to kick off point ranged from 0.83 to 1.48 minutes per foot, and averaged 1.02 minutes per foot. Samples in the upper Lodgepole were generally light gray limestone with overall poor porosity. Total gas ranged from 56 to 230 units and averaged 138 units. Kick off point of 9,790’ was reached at 2:45 pm on November 1, 2014. <br/>Curve 9, 790’ -— 10,456’ MD <br/>Directional tools for the build section were picked up at 9,790’ MD, at which point the curve was kicked off. The landing target was to be 11’ into the Three Forks formation, initially set at 10,191’ TVD. No tn'p gas was recorded at kick oﬁ‘ point. Drilling rates in the Lodgepole below KOP ranged ﬁom 0.47 to 1.75 minutes per foot, averaging 0.73 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 45 to 247 units, averaging 140 units. Samples in the lower Lodgepole were majority light gray to tan gray limestone with overall poor to fair porosity. Gamma markers were utilized throughout the curve to correlate to the Solberg 31-2TFH and 31-2WH wells, which are located on the same pad.

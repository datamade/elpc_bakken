Sliding kept the wellbore within the 9’ target window. <br/>At 17,826’ measured depth, the wellbore dropped in true vertical depth and went out of the bottom of the target window. The base clean gamma contact point was seen and reached a low of 50 API. This contact point was used to conﬁrm the dip to be 8931 degrees. Sliding succeeded in bringing the wellbore up in true vertical depth before the Aquitard was encountered. The wellbore crossed up into the base of the target window and the clean gamma contact was seen at 18,528’ measured depth. In the interval from 17,826’ to 18,528’ gamma ranged from 50 to 92 API and averaged 69 API. Total gas ranged from 253 to 2273 units and averaged 993 units. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.15 to 4.63 minutes per foot and averaged 0.42 minutes per foot. <br/>The wellbore continued to rise in true vertical depth and crossed out the top of the window. Sliding succeeded in bringing the wellbore down in true vertical depth. At 19,093 ’ the wellbore entered the top of the target window and the clean gamma contact was seen. This gamma marker was used to estimate the dip to be 8943 degrees. The wellbore remained in the 9’ target window for the remainder of the lateral. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.17 to 4.87 minutes per foot and averaged 0.44 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged ﬁom 146 to 1240 units and averaged 682 units. Gamma ranged ﬁom 57 to 143 API and averaged 105 API. The samples were generally described as sandstone: cream, light tan, translucent, very ﬁne, subangular, moderately sorted, moderately cemented, dolomitic cement; scattered shale, light green; trace siltstone, light gray; rare pyrite; good porosity; scattered dull green ﬂuorescence, cloudy green cut. <br/>The Solberg 21-2TFH reached a total measured depth of 20,748’ at 11:00 pm on November 8, 2014. The Solberg 21-2TFH is currently awaiting completion. <br/>Jessica Stark WeIIsite Geologist </p>

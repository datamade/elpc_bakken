It was picked by a slight up spike in gamma from 10,380 feet to 10,381 feet MD. The lithology of the Lodgepole Formation was mainly limestone that was gray, tan gray, and light gray with an even green ﬂuorescence and weak cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 100 ﬁ/hr.

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The curve was started at 11:00 AM CST on February 5, 2015 with an 8 % inch Reed curve bit and a NOV 2.38 degree mud motor targeting the Middle Bakken Formation with an initial target TVD of 11,235 feet and 15 feet into the Middle Bakken Formation. The Stenehjem 41-3-H gamma markers were correlated to the Stenehjem 413—3H gamma data. Baker Hughes directional team started the curve with an average built rate of 11 degrees per 100 feet needed. While correlating gamma signatures between Stenehjem 41—3HU and Stenehjem 41—3-3H, the ideal landing target stayed consistently between 11,232 feet and 11,236 feet TVD throughout the seven Lodgepole Formation gamma markers. The ideal landing target changed to 11,232 feet TVD aﬁer the Lodgepole number two marker was encountered. Once the False Bakken and Scallion Formation tops were encountered, the third and ﬁnal ideal landing target was set to 11,235’ TVD. <br/>False Bakken 11,371 ’ MD 11,192’ T VD -8,815’SS <br/>The False Bakken Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,371 feet, 8 feet high to the prognosis. The pick of the False Bakken was primarily done off gamma correlation to the Stenehjem 41-3—3H curve gamma. The lithology of the False Bakken Formation was limestone that was brown to gray with an even yellow ﬂuorescence and a milky cloudy cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 60 ﬁlm. Gas was an average of 366 units with a maximum of 802 units through the False Bakken Formation. <br/>Upper Bakken 11,411 ’ MD 11,205 ’ TVD -8,828’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 11,411 feet, 6 feet high to the prognosis. The pick of the Upper Bakken was primarily done off gamma correlation to Stenehjem 41-3-3H curve gamma. The lithology of the Upper Bakken Formation was shale that was black and dark brown with a dull even green yellow ﬂuorescence and a thick milky yellow cut. Rate of penetration was an average of 94 ft/hr. Gas was an average of 463 units with a maximum of 847 units through the Upper Bakken Formation. </p>

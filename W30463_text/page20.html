The well was drilled by Pioneer 74 ﬂex rig. The well is located in the NENE quarter of section 3 T148N R99W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Stenehjem 41~3HU was spudded on January 30, 2015 at 7:00 AM CST. The well reached a total depth of 20,863’ MD on February 12, 2015. Geological services began at 9,450’ MD in the Charles Formation on February 3, 2015 and continued to TD. Samples were caught by mudloggers throughout the well. All samples were washed, cataloged, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Society in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Total Gas LTD gas equipment was used to monitor gas throughout the well in correspondence with NOV RigSense EDR. <br/>Vertical 9,450’ — 10, 715’ [MB <br/>Logging began in the Charles Formation at a measured depth of 9,450 feet at 10:20 PM CST on February 3, 2015. Rate of penetration varied throughout the diﬁ‘erent rock types and formations but averaged 90 feet per hour throughout the vertical section. Gas averaged 23 units with a maximum reading of 95 units in the Lodgepole Formation. The Pioneer 74 ﬂex rig reached kick off point at 5:00 PM CST on February 4, 2015 at 10,715 feet. </p>

It was picked at the base of a slight heat up in gamma at 9,664 feet MD. Samples also changed from salt that was clear and translucent to off white anhydrite. The lithology of the Base of Last Salt Formation was mainly light gray to gray limestone and off white anhydrite with scattered yellow white ﬂuorescence and weak slow cuts. Rate of penetration was an average of 80 ﬂ/hr.

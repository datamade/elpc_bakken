Cement quality and weight: You must choose a cement slurry that is designed to solve the problems speciﬁc to each casing string. <br/>2. Waiting time: You must hold the cement slurry in place and under pressure until it reaches its initial set without disturbing it. A cement slurry is a timedependent liquid and must be allowed to undergo a hydration reaction to produce a competent cement sheath. A fresh cement slurry can be worked (thickening or pump time) as long as it is in a plastic state and before going through its transition phase. If the cement slurry is not allowed to transition without being disturbed. it may be subjected to changes in density. dilution. settling, water separation. and gas cutting that may lead to a lack of zonal isolation and possible bridging in the annulus. <br/>3. Pipe movement: Pipe movement may be one of the single most inﬂuential factors in mud removal. Reciprocation and/or rotation mechanically breaks up gelled mud and changes the ﬂow patterns in the annulus to improve displacement efﬁciency. <br/>4. Mud properties (for cementing): <br/>Rheology: Plastic Viscosity (PV) < 15 centipoise (cp) <br/>Yield Point (YP) < 10 lb/100 ft2 These properties should be reviewed with the Mud Engineer, Drilling Engineer, and Company Representative(s) to ensure no hole problems are created. <br/>Gel Strength: The 10-second/10-minute gel strength values should be such that the 10—second and 10-minute readings are close together or ﬂat (i.e., 5/6). The 30-minute reading should be less than 20 lb/100 ftz. Sufﬁcient shear stress may not be achieved on a primary cement job to remove mud left in the hole if the mud were to develop more than 25 lb/100 ft2 of gel strength. <br/>Fluld Loss: Decreasing the ﬁltrate loss into a permeable zone enhances the creation of a thin, competent ﬁlter cake. A thin, competent ﬁlter cake created by a low ﬂuid loss mud system is desirable over a thick, partially gelled ﬁlter cake. A mud system created with a low fluid loss will be more easily displaced. The ﬂuid loss value should be < 15 cc’s (ideal would be 5 oc‘s). <br/>5. Circulation: Prior to cementing circulate full hole volume twice. or until well conditioned mud is being returned to the surface. There should be no cutting in the mud returns. An annular velocity of 260 feet per minute is optimum (SPE/IADC 18617), if possible. <br/>6. Flow rate: Turbulent ﬂow is the most desirable ﬂow regime for mud removal. lf turbulence cannot be achieved pump at as high a ﬂow rate that can practically and safely be used to create the maximum ﬂow energy. The highest mud removal is achieved when the maximum flow energy is obtained. <br/>7. Pipe Centralization: This Cement will take the path of least resistance, therefore proper centralization is important to help prevent the casing from contacting the borehole wall. A minimum standoff of 70% should be targeted for optimum displacement efﬁciency. <br/>8. Rat hole: A weighted viscous pill placed in the rat hole prior to cementing will minimize the risk of higher density cement mixing with lower density mud when the well is static. <br/>9. Top and Bottom plugs: A top and bottom plug is recommended to be run on all pn'mary casing jobs. The bottom plug should be run after the spacer and ahead of the ﬁrst cement slurry. <br/>to. Spacers and ﬂushes: Spacers and/or ﬂushes should be used to prevent contamination between the cement slurry and the drilling ﬂuid. They are also used to clean the wellbore and aid with bonding. To determine the volume, either a minimum of 10 minutes of contact time or 1000it. of annular ﬁll. whichever is greater, is recommended. For drilling operations using dieselbased drilling ﬂuids. we suggest Tuned Spacer III. This is a water-based spacer designed to eliminate the use of diesel thereby mitigating environmental impact and reducing job cost. This spacer can be customized to the desired density and rheology (PV and VP) in order to better to remove mud and ﬁlter cake from the hole. This will result in the best zonal isolation by providing superior cement-to-casing and cement-to-formation bonds. </p>

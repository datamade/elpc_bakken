The formation was chosen primarily with the use of gamma. The limestone was medium to dark gray in color and was argillaceous to carbonaceous in part, and had poor to moderate induration, and poor to no visible porosity. The ROP was near 90ft/hr. <br/>Mission Canyon 9, 532ﬁ MD 9, 526ﬁ T VD - 7,5 7% SS <br/>The Mission Canyon was drilled at a TVD of 9,526ﬁ. The formation was composed of limestone. The limestone was light to medium gray brown, to light cream in color. The limestone grain size was wackestone to packestone, and had moderate induration. Samples had minor amounts of anhydrite. The samples showed poor to no porosity, dull ﬂuorescence, and weak cloudy cuts. <br/>Lodgepole 10,111ft MD 10,105ft TVD -8,149ft SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation was drilled at a TVD of 10,105ﬁ, and was composed of medium to dark gray limestone. It had a wackestone grain size, and was argillaceous to carbonaceous in part, with poor to moderate induration. The intergranular porosity was poor to none visible. Most samples showed dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a weak cloudy cut. The background gas was near 25 units. The decision was made to trip out of the hole at a measured depth of 10,490ﬁ for KOP, to pick up directional tools. <br/>Curve 10,490 —11,180ft <br/>The curve was started at a depth of 10,490ﬁ. While drilling the curve, gamma and sample correlations were used to aid in landing within the Three Forks. The initial target TVD was for landing the curve was 10,923ﬁ. While building the curve, the ROP was near SOﬁ/hr. The formation markers were coming in low to the prognosis. The decision was made to lower the landing target by ﬁve feet to 10,928ﬁ TVD. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 11, 011ft MD 1 0, 894ft TVD -8, 938ft SS <br/>The Bakken Shale was drilled at a TVD of 10,894ﬁ. The shale was brownish black, with a slightly silty appearance. It was ﬁrm, slightly calcareous and subblocky to blocky. Occasional micro-pyrite was seen in the samples. The shale had spotty ﬂuorescence and a slow streaming cut. The penetration rate was less than 1 min/ft while in the shale. The background gas increased aﬁer ﬁrst getting into the shale to as high as 4,089 units, then gradually decreased to near 1,000 units. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,089’MD 10,914ft TVD «9,953,? SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was ﬁrst encountered in samples at a TVD of 10,9l4ﬁ. The samples were composed of siltstone. It was medium gray to tan in color. It was moderately argillaceous, calcareous to limey in part, and had poor induration. The </p>

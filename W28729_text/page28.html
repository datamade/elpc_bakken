It will require less than 100’ of pipeline to connect the new wells to ONEOK’s low pressure gathering system. <br/>Existing Lines <br/>At the terminus of the metering and associated piping at each well’s production facilities, the piping will connect to a 6.625” outside diameter (OD) gathering line. This 6.625” OD gathering line traverses approximately 1.5 miles and then connects to an 8.625” OD gathering line. This 8.625” OD gathering extends approximately 2.75 miles and then connects to a 16” OD gathering line. The gas then travels approximately 30 miles before being compressed at the Lodgepole compressor station. This will be the primary ﬂow path of gas delivered to ONEOK from this pad. As noted under “Gathering System”, above, the gas will have secondary ﬂow paths due to the dynamics of ONEOK’s gathering system. The table below shows the capacities and current ﬂows of the primary gathering lines connecting this well. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">ONEOK is in the process of adding compressors at its Lost Bridge compressor station in Section 14, T147N, R96W, Dunn County and installing a 16” OD low pressure gathering line that will start in T145N, R94W, Dunn County (Dunn Center) and end at the inlet of the Lost Bridge compressor station. Construction of these facilities will redirect gas that currently flows south on the existing 16” OD pipeline to flow on the new facilities. Although this does not directly increase the capacity of the primary flow path of the Dukart Pad, it redirects gas that currently flows on the same pipelines to a different compressor station, in essence reducing volumes <br/>transported on the primary ﬂow path for these wells. </p>

Choke size will depend on ﬁnal shut in pressure post ﬁ'ac and well pressure prior to opening the choke. The choke will be adjusted up or down based on ﬂowing pressure, liquid rates and sand returns, to prevent clogging manifold chokes. During ﬂowback, the water chlorides and sand </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Hello, <br/>i have reviewed the permit stipulation affidavit submitted by Continental for the Robert 1-13H regarding drilling the pad in a designated wellhead protection area. The wellhead protection area is for Allstate Peterbilt which is a transient Noncommunity WHPA. The system currently has 1 well with a total depth of 92 feet screened in the alluvlum and outwash channels of the Little Muddy aquifer system. Groundwater in this system is typically under confined conditions with an average groundwater depth of 65 feet. A review of wells in the area show the nearest domestic water well to be approximately 1.7 miles to the west. Another transient Noncommunity designated WHPA, Springbrook Bar, lies approximately 1.5 miles to the east, that system is currently inactive, but the well remains, so the WHPA remains in place. After reviewing the safeguards CRl intends to set in place, the North Dakota Department of Health has no concerns regarding the drilling ofthe Robert 1»13H provided all the steps are followed as laid out. Also, please notify Allstate Peterbilt of the drilling of the Robert 1-13H and send them a copy of the safeguards that will be taken. lf you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. <br/>Shannon Suggs <br/>Environmental Scientist NDDoH—Divison of Water Quality 918 E.

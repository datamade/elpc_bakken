    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">represented the upper half the middle Bakken member. Samples demonstrated good shows of petroleum in the form of dull but solid ﬂuorescence and instant, milky clouds drawn out by solvent. October 15“, 2014 at 11:15 am CT, the end of the curve was reached with a measured depth of 11,184 feet and true vertical depth of 10,788 feet. The landing placed the wellbore 15 vertical feet into the middle Bakken. <br/>Lateral Wellbore 11,184 ’— 20,245 ’ MD <br/>Representing the ﬁnal vertical and curve to be drilled in the 4 well sequence, the Mrachek 21-26-3HR lateral would begin immediately after the 7 inch intermediate casing had been set and cemented into place. Drilling of the lateral began on October 17“‘, 2014 at 3:30 pm CT. The assembly exited casing into the bottom of an 8 foot target window that had been projected downdip at an estimated 89.9°. A planned 23° turn to an azimuth of 180° in addition to raising the wellbore up into the target zone required frequent sliding early in the lateral. By measured depth 11,800 feet the wellbore had reached the center of the target and completed the directional turn at measured depth 12,200 feet. The end of the directional tangent now allowed faster open hole drilling. <br/>Increased rates of penetration were matched with an increased wellbore inclination. The assembly soon passed the center of zone into the top half of the 8 foot target window. Samples of lightly colored dolomite having rare amounts of clastic sediment were consistent to the lithology expected within the target. Petroleum shows in the initial one thousand feet were moderate to good in sample with added solvent producing instant, cloudy cuts. Gas values were modest with an average of 490 total units. <br/>While high within zone, near measured depth 12,500 feet, gamma data indicated a change in target. The window was lowered 5 feet and projected at new estimated angle of 89.7°. The change placed the wellbore high and out of zone and within feet of the overlying shale. On October 18“”, 2014 at 5:20 am CT a MWD tool failure resulted in a trip to surface for tools. Drilling resumed at 5:15 pm CT the same evening. Little effort was needed to lower the wellbore into the new target. By measured depth 12,800 feet the assembly was tracking slightly high to center of zone. Gamma and sample data coming in was reinforcing the current interpretation of the target’s position and angle. <br/>On October 19‘“, 2014 at 12:00 am CT another MWD tool failure at measured depth 13,403 feet resulted in a trip out of the hole and drilling resumed at 10:10 am CT the same morning. Later the same day at 12:15 pm CT a third failure of the MWD tool required a trip to surface from measured depth 13,767 feet. Drilling resumed at 12:30 am CT early in the morning of October 20‘“. Soon after drilling began, gamma data alerted to another change in the target position and angle. <br/>The target zone was shiﬁed up 5 feet and projected at a still estimated angle of 902°. The change was applied ﬁ'om measured depth 14,000 feet and placed the wellbore’s current position low to center of zone. Expecting better gas and petroleum shows in the top half of the target, the wellbore was allowed to maintain an inclination over that of the target. Within 700 feet the assembly had been placed in the top half of the 8 foot window and was tracking zone. As </p>

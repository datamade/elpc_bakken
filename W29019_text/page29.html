Since the Lodgepole formation top came in close to where it was expected, the true vertical depth landing target was maintained at 10,788 feet. <br/>Curve 10,232’ —11,184’ MD <br/>Soon after identifying the Lodgepole formation on October 14th, 2014 at 11:15 am CT, the kick off point was reached with a measured depth 10,232 feet A trip to surface for curve building tools was completed and drilling of the curve began later the same night at 11:00 pm CT high within the Lodgepole Formation. Gamma markers low within the Lodgepole led to a slight target adjustment, shiﬁing it 2 feet down to 10,790. The value represented a landing of 18 vertical feet into the middle Bakken. <br/>Lithology of the Lodgepole consisted of light brown to light gray brown, slightly argillaceous, lightly dolomitic limestone. Petroleum shows of the Lodgepole were scattered and generally poor. Some light oil staining, dull to pinpoint ﬂuorescence, and occasional weak streams of petroleum were visible when cut with solvent. Gas values seen ﬁ'om the formation never reached over 100 total units. </p>

A light tan dolomite sample with traces of black shale was all that was seen of it in cuttings. The False Bakken top and bottom were determined entirely by gamma signature.

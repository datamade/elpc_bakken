The course 01 the wellbore would track the target zone at an azimuth of 180°. This well is located along state highway 200, 5 miles north west of Alexander, North Dakota in the NE NW Section 26 T151N R102W. The bottom hole coordinates of the Mrachek 21-26-3HR are located 260' FSL 2,194' FWL in the SE SW 1A of Section 35 T151N R102W. <br/>This well was spud on September 24*, 2014. Well site geological services began at measured depth 8,970 feet, within the Charles formation One hour, ten foot, thirty foot, and ﬁfty foot lagged samples were caught by roughnecks, geologist/mud loggers and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Surface of the well was drilled using salt water brine and a 13.5 inch bit. Casing measuring 9 5/8” in diameter was set in cement at 2,236 feet measured/true vertical depth. The vertical wellbore, and curve were then both drilled using petroleum based invert mud. An eight and three quarter inch wellbore was drilled to the end of the curve tangent and intermediate 7” casing was set at 11,174 feet measured depth. The approximately 10,000 foot lateral was drilled with a six inch bit using saltwater based drilling ﬂuid. Gas monitoring equipment was provided by Neset Consulting Services, using a Total Gas system. <br/>Vertical wellbore <br/>Logging depth of 9,000 feet was reached early in the morning of October 14*, 2014 at 12:15 am CT. It was the fourth vertical and curve segment to be drilled on the location in a four well series. The initial true vertical depth target of 10,788 feet was in agreement with values seen drilling the three adjacent Mrachek wells and initially left unchanged. </p>

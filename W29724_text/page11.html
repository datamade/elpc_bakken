This 8.625” OD gathering line extends approximately 2.25 miles and then connects to a 16” OD gathering line. The 16” OD gathering line extends approximately 24 miles and then connects to the inlet station piping at ONEOK’s Lodgepole compressor station. This will be the primary ﬂow path of gas delivered to ONEOK from this pad. As noted under “Gathering System”, above, the gas will have secondary ﬂow paths due to the dynamics of ONEOK’s gathering system. The table below shows the capacities and current ﬂows of the primary gathering lines connecting this well. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">ONEOK is in the process of adding compressors at its Lost Bridge compressor station in Section 14, T147N, R96W, Dunn County and installing a 16” OD low pressure gathering line that will start in T145N, R94W, Dunn County (Dunn Center) and end at the inlet of the Lost Bridge compressor station. Construction of these facilities will redirect gas that cmrently ﬂows on the primary and secondary flow paths of the State Dvorak A 16 Pad to ﬂow on the new facilities. Although this does not directly increase the capacity of the primary and secondary ﬂow paths of the State Dvorak A 16 Pad, it redirects gas that currently ﬂows on the same pipelines to a different compressor station, in essence reducing volumes transported on the ﬂow paths for this well. ONEOK is also planning on constructing a new discharge line from its Lost Bridge compressor station that will deliver some of the gas currently processed at ONEOK’s Grasslands Processing Plant to ONEOK’S Garden Creek Processing Plant(s). <br/>Flowback Strategy <br/>After the fracture treatment, these wells will be ﬂowed through a choke to test production tanks. Choke size will depend on ﬁnal shut in pressure post frac and well pressure prior to opening the choke. The choke will be adjusted up or down based on ﬂowing pressure, liquid rates and sand returns, to prevent clogging manifold chokes. During ﬂowback, the water chlorides and sand content will be monitored. When the water chlorides are greater than 100,000 ppm and the produced ﬂuids contain no sand, the wells will be turned to production facilities. Since the pipeline is already close to the location of the pad and Oxy Will have its production facilities constructed before ﬂowback starts, then gas sales should start as soon as the well start ﬂowing through the production facilities, unless there are capacity issues on ONEOK’s system at that </p>

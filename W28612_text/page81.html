Drilling would continue in the clean “B” facies until a rise in rotation would send the wellbore in the “A” facies at 11,687’ MD. A downslide was put in at 11,732’ MD that would bring the wellbore back down into the clean “B” facies. <br/>Drilling would continue in the clean “B” Facies. 2 downslides were put in at 12,846’ MD and 12,941 ’ MD to prevent the wellbore from rising up and out of the target window. A downslide was put in at 13,53 9’ MD to send the wellbore through the B/C marker. This marker was encountered at 13,620’ MD. This encounter would put the dip rate at 9063 degrees for this section. </p>

These slides would send the wellbore through the B/C marker at 16,201 ’ MD. This encounter would put the dip rate at 90.86 degrees. <br/>The wellbore would continue to drop and exit through the base of the target window at 16,250’ MD. Drilling would continue in the “C” facies with high side slides being drilled at 16,820’ MD, 17,009’ MD and 17,229’ MD. These slides would send the wellbore up through the B/C marker at 17,382” MD. This encounter would indicate a steepening the formation to 90.57 degrees. <br/>The wellbore would exit through the base of the clean “B” facies at 17,563’ MD. This encounter would indicate a signiﬁcant steepening in the formation to 91.95 degrees for this section. <br/>The wellbore would continue to rise in rotation from this point. This along with an apparent deﬂection up would send the wellbore rising quickly in the formation. The wellbore would enter the “A” Facies at 18,153’ MD. A downslide was put in at 18,239’ <br/>MD to prevent the continued rise in the wellbore. </p>

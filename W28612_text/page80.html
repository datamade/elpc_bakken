    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">THE CURVE <br/>The Bartleson 13-18H curve was drilled with a Security MDSi516MEBPX 8.75” bit along with a Baker Hughes mud motor set to 2.4 degrees and an invert mud system. There was a 30’ rotation made from this point before the sliding for the curve commenced at the kick off point of 9,780’ MD. <br/>FALSE BAKKEN 10,445 ’ MD 10,272’ T VD -8,198’ SS <br/>At 10,445’ MD the False Bakken came in at 10,272’ TVD, 4’ low to prognosis. The gamma reached 137.72 API units while in the False Bakken. The samples for the False Bakken consisted of cream gray to gray tan, with blocky to platy limestone. The samples had weak milky yellow cuts with a peak of 6 units of gas seen in this interval. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Scallion was the next formation encountered. The scallion came in at 10,460’ MD and 10,275’ TVD, 4’ low to prognosis. The gamma cooled back down to 48.62 API units in the Scallion. The Scallion consisted of mostly cream buff Limestone with slow dull milky yellow cuts. Gas peaked at 825 units of gas along with fair milky cuts. <br/>UPPER BAKKEN 10,496 ’ MD 10,287’ T VD -8,213 ’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale came in at 10,496’ MD, and 10,287’ TVD, this was 3’ low to the prognosis. The gamma reached 609.41 units at this point. Background gas averaged 443.04 units, peaking 224 units. Samples in the Upper Bakken were black, carbonaceous blocky shale, with instant milky yellow cuts. <br/>MIDDLE BAKKEN 1 0, 584’ MD 10,306’ T VD -8,232’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at a MD of 10,584’ MD and 10,306’ TVD, 1’ low to the prognosis. The Middle Bakken was picked based on the change in samples and a decrease in gamma from 686.45 units down to 69.31 units API. The Middle Bakken samples consisted mostly of a light to dark cream gray tan platy siltstone. Gas peaked at 870 units of gas along with fair milky cuts. The curve was landed at a total depth of 18,300’ MD on Monday, September 1, 2014 CST. 7” intermediate casing was set to 10,736’ MD. <br/>LATERAL </p>

The wellbore would begin dropping following the drilling of the shoe. This drop would bring the wellbore into the clean “B” faices at 10,655’ MD. 2 high side slides were put in </p>

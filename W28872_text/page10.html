The systems strips out NGLs from the gas stream and refrigerates them for storage reducing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) thereby mitigating environmental impacts by significantly decreasing emissions from flare stacks. The Units can be combined and scaled up to handle high volumes of gas. <br/>Hess has contracted with GTUIT to provide mobile gas treatment units (MTUs). As of 6/23/2014, Hess has five GTUIT units being utilized in the ﬁeld and expects delivery of three additional units by 8/1/2014. The units have capacities ranging from 500 MSCFD to 1,000 MSCFD and can be relocated from one site to another. The units also can be linked onslte to provide a larger daily capacity intake. <br/>Hess is developing methodologies that will result in an order-of—merit list of candidate sites at which to <br/>deploy the MTUs, based on environmental, regulatory, economic, and operational factors. There are commercial constraints present which pertain to Hess’s commercial agreement with GTUIT; wells must <br/>produce at least half of the MSCFD unit capacity and cover the initial connection fees in order for use of the GTUIT unit to be economic. </p>

GTl Altronics is a retrofit technology allowing diesel engines to operate on a mixture of natural gas and diesel fuel. Boiler sheds will be converted to run on 100% natural gas during winter operations. The units have a gas requirement of 50%. The Bi-Fuel System required approximately 75-100 MSCFD and the boilers require approx. 100-150 MSCFD. <br/>Hess is unable to utilize this technology on depleted wells lacking gas production. Well surging creating <br/>intennittent gas supply is another issue related to Bi-Fuel usage. Safety is also a concern as the system requires aboveground gas lines. </p>

The units are tied directly into the natural gas production onsite and supplement liquid propane for use during hourly production fluctuation. Natural gas generators require liquid propane to be used when gas is not being produced from the well. As production of gas increases and decreases hourly, the units may switch from propane to natural gas and then back to propane. <br/>Hess performed two pilot programs to evaluate performance characteristics of natural gas generators from two manufacturers. Both manufacturers require further development to increase their reliability and performance of units. <br/>Economics favor diesel generators over natural gas generators at this time due to cost and reliability. Pilot program was not able to produce consistent results to move forward with field implementation at this time. Natural gas generators will continue to be evaluated as an alternative in the future. </p>

Dakota. </p>

    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">As we discussed, the key feature (here) is the Precision 607 is arriving a few days later than originally scheduled due to unseasonably wet weather & recent road closures. The delay has resulted in probable rig arrival on the permit expiry date MW with anticipated spud on/around August 6. The attached affidavit stipulates this development along with the existence of Baytex lateral 89 being operational (adjacent) to this well location and available for connection within 30 days of completion. As you’ll note on the gas gathering map, which the original was placed of record at a May 29 gas flaring hearing, Baytex (now) has 86% of its Divide County wells connected to gas sales. Please note that the Nelson 18-19 is (still) pending hook-up as it was one of a very few wells that has H25 concentrations that exceed our contract limits. Basically, an anomaly. We are working with OneOK to get that resolved and we do not anticipate any H25 problems with the upcoming Nelson 7-6. As such, I would not think any formal gas capture plan would be needed given the fact situation (here). As this is an off~unit surface location, this is addressed in the last paragraph of the affidavit. </p>

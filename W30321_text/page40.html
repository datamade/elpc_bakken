The well was drilled by Pioneer 74 ﬂex rig. The well is located in the NWNW quarter of section 3 T148N R99W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Sondrol 11-3-3H was spudded on February 22, 2015 at 10:30 PM CST. The well reached a total depth of 20,668’ MD on March 18, 2015. Geological services began at 9,450’ MD in the Charles Formation on March 9, 2015 and continued to TD. Samples were caught by mudloggers throughout the well. All samples were washed, cataloged, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Society in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Total Gas LTD gas equipment was used to monitor gas throughout the well in correspondence with NOV RigSense EDR. <br/>Vertical 9,450’ — 10,710’MD </p>

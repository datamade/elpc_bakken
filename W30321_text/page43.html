    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling resumed on March 13, 2015 at 2:00 PM CST in the Middle Bakken Formation. According to the structure map, it was believed this well would average a 90.15 degree up dip - expecting formation to come up a total of approximately 25 feet throughout the lateral section. The Middle Bakken in this part of the Bully Field was expected to be 33 feet thick. A target window of 10 to 18 feet into the Middle Bakken Formation was set by Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation. Overall, formation trended slightly up through the well, with an average dip of 90.05°. In total, formation came up ~11’ in total vertical depth. Mudloggers used A/C and C/D facie contacts along with a clean gamma signature which was one to two feet above target window to correlate dip and determine structural position. <br/>The Sondrol 11-3-3H lateral was completed in 2 runs using two NOV drill bits, with the only trip in the lateral at 17,706’ MD for a motor failure. <br/>The lithology of the Middle Bakken Formation was siltstone that was relatively medium to dark in color. The majority of the Sondrol 11-3—3H lateral section was drilled nine to 20 feet into the Middle Bakken. Throughout the C facies gray, dark gray, and tan gray siltstone were the dominate colors found. As the wellbore trended up into the A facies, the dominate colors were slightly lighter in color and ranged from light gray to tan gray and cream gray. The footage spent out of the bottom of the target window; in the D facies, samples were mostly dark in color and dominantly brown and gray in color. Along with gamma interpretations, these Subtle differences in color, as we transitioned through the zone, made it possible to distinguish structural position. <br/>Rate of penetration was an average of 200 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 480 units with a max of 1852 units through the Middle Bakken Formation. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The Whiting Oil and Gas Corp. Sondrol 11-3-3H well reached total depth on March 18, 2015 at 8:45 AM CDT, at 20,665' MD in the Middle Bakken Formation giving this well 10077 feet of open horizontal hole. The Sondrol 11—3—3H is currently awaiting completion. </p>

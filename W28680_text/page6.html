Samples had strong, abundant ﬂuorescence and very strong oil cuts throughout the well. Oil staining was mostly moderate and moderate to abundant oil was observed in the samples caught. This lateral was drilled almost entirely in the target zone with the exception of a span of 750’ and another of 500’ where the wellbore went slightly out the top of the target zone. Neither of these showed a change in shows and samples looked consistent throughout in regards to porosity and shows. Although there were no clear cut indicators, I believe we passed through a few areas of fractures as seen on the other wells of this pad which should make for a good fracking operation. The trip made at 16,263’ MD showed excellent gas and oil returns with a high ﬂare and adds another strong indicator that this could be an excellent producer <br/>The Bjella 2-13H is currently awaiting completion <br/>Ryan Genre Neset Consulting Service </p>

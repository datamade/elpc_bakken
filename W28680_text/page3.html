The bit remained trending very near to dip and at 13,600’ MD a change in gamma was seen. This came from the spot where the hot marker was thought to be but was much higher than it had been. Drilling continued with the bit riding in this marker until seeing a sudden high jump in angle. Gamma showed the bit going out the top of target at 14,210’ MD, indicating the dip was steepening again. Corrections were made and the bit entered the target again at 14,725’ MD. As the bit came down gamma counts increased very quickly and came up to nearly 60 counts as before and much higher than at the start of the well. This higher gamma from the hot marker was seen until reaching the end of this section, crossing approximately 5’ below the top of the target zone. <br/>This section showed very good gas and oil shows with background gas averaging 1,5003,000 units and connection gases of 2,700-4,500 units with chromats showing the heavy gases to be high. High heavy gases are a known oil indicator. Oil shows of 40-70% coverage were seen through the entire section. Water weights were kept at 9.7 to 9.9 pounds in this section. Refer to chart below to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. </p>

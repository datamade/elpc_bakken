The target formation was the Middle Bakken. The surface location was set at 360’ FNL & 1,200’ FWL of Section 13. Drilling began on August 24, 2014 and continued until completion of the curve on August 31, 2014. The well was then paused to walk and drill other wells on the pad. Operations resumed on October 9, 2014 and continued until a TD of 19,156” was reached at 7:50 am CT on October 16, 2014 and had ending coordinates of 236.22’ FSL & 676.32’ FWL of Section 24 T159N R96W. <br/>Wellsite geological services consisted of two mudloggers. A Noram gas detecting system with chromatograph was utilized. Samples were caught at 30’ intervals from 7,249’ to end of the curve at 9,573’ MD and 100’ intervals throughout the lateral section to a TD of 19,156’ MD. All samples were saved and boxed to be sent to the State of North Dakota. <br/>Charles 7,249’ MD 7,249’ T VD -4,924’ SS <br/>The Charles formation was picked off sample and drilling change. The Charles formation was salt, translucent, white, milky white, hard, brittle in part, massive, with intermittent stringers of anhydrite, white, light gray, amorphous, soft. At approximately 7,523’ samples changed to limestone, light brown, tan, yellow brown, cream, crypto to microcrystalline, fossiliferous at times, moderately calcareous, slightly argillaceous, ﬁrm to slightly soﬂ, dolomitic in part, with frequent beds of salt observed. Aﬁer the Base Last at 7,832’ MD, 7,832” TVD (5,507’ SS) samples returned to limestone, brown, dark brown, gray brown, crypto to microcrystalline, fossiliferous at times, very to moderately calcareous, argillaceous at times, ﬁrm to slightly soﬁ, very dolomitic at times. Intervals of very poor intergranular porosity were observed and very slow streaming ﬂuorescing cuts at times. Gas ranged from 15 to 333 units. The top of the Charles came in 12’ low to prognosis while the Base Last Salt came in with prognosis. <br/>Mission Canyon 8,050’ MD 8,050’ TVD -5, 725’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was picked off sample and drilling change and was limestone, dark brown, brown, minor light brown, microcrystalline, calcitic at times, moderately calcareous, moderately argillaceous, silty, ﬁrm to slightly hard, dolomitic at times, with intervals of poor intergranular porosity observed and very slow to fast streaming ﬂuorescing cuts at times. Gas ranged from 39 to 265 units. The Mission Canyon came in 1’ low to prognosis. <br/>Lodgepole 8,716’MD 8, 716’ TVD -6,391’SS <br/>The Lodgepole formation was picked off sample and drilling change. Samples were limestone, brown, light brown, gray brown, cream, tan, crypto to microcrystalline, scattered clear to milky calcite, moderate to very calcareous, moderately silty, argillaceous, ﬁrm to hard, dolomitic at times, earthy to chalky, with intervals of poor intergranular porosity observed and moderate to </p>

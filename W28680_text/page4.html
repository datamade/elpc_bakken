    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The bit entered this section 5’ below the top of the target zone and leveled off at the hot marker and following dip. Drilling continued on with the bit running with or close to dip. Gamma remained showing the hot marker and with slight variances in the wellbore with relation to dip it was found that the signature had changed. At the beginning of the well the clean streak showed 25—30 gamma counts with the hot marker showing 38-45 counts. As drilling went on a continuous 50-60 gamma counts were seen until a sudden drop at 17,000’ MD when the gamma dropped down to 25—35 counts, close to what was seen before. After seeing the cool off, the bit rose slightly until coming back down and crossing the end of this section 5’ below the top. Based on this gamma it appeared the bit was in the middle of target as interpreted throughout the section. Gamma change did not cause alarm and we continued drilling based on targets in place. Clean gamma streaks in this area have been seen to pinch out fairly often and can show up again without notice. Nothing was seen to clearly indicate the presence of fractured areas but there were indicators of that on other wells from this pad. <br/>At 16,263’ MD a trip was made due to slow ROP. The bit, motor, and MWD tool were replaced. While circulating the trip gas up, we saw the gas detector max out at 10,000 units with very high chromat readings of C3 through C6, heavy gases. C1 and C2 readings were much lower than normally seen. Oil ﬂow was 100% with heavy green oil coming over the shakers. <br/>This section showed very good gas and oil shows with background gas averaging 1,7003,400 units and connection gases of 2,800-5,800 units with chromats showing the heavy gases to be high. Following the trip an increase is gas was seen and showed more C1 and C2 gases while maintaining high heavy gases. It is unknown whether this was due to some change in the water or a slightly higher position in zone. High heavy gases are a known oil indicator. Oil shows of 40-70% coverage were seen through the entire section. Water weights were kept at 9.9 to 9.95 </p>

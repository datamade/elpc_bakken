At 8,831’ MD KOP was reached and a trip was made to pick up curve assembly and begin drilling the curve. There were 507 units of gas seen from this trip The Lodgepole came in 26’ low to prognosis. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Bakken Shale was picked from gamma change. Samples were shale, black, noncalcareous, carbonaceous, pyritic, smooth, ﬁssile in part, blocky to sub-blocky, no porosity, abundant dull green ﬂuorescence, immediate bright milky yellow cut. Gas increased to up to 914 units. The Upper Bakken shale came in 22’ low to prognosis. <br/>Midtﬂe Bakken Member 9,445 ’ 1WD 9,280’ TVD -6,955 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken Member was picked from gamma change. Samples were dolomite, light gray brown, light brown, tan, minor cream, microcrystalline, rarely pyritic, moderately silty, moderately calcareous, slightly argillaceous, earthy, microsucrosic in part, very limy at times, poor intercrystalline porosity, rare spotty dark brown oil stain, scattered dull yellow green ﬂuorescence, with an immediate bright milky white to yellow cut. Gas ranged from 48 to 110 units. The Middle Bakken Member came in 25’ low to prognosis. The curve was drilled to 9573’ MD on August 29, 2014. Casing was set at 9,558’ MD, 9,292.58’ TVD and 433.77’ VS. BHL ofcasing was 782.45’ FNL & 978,53’ FWL in Sec 13, T159N, and R96W. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Lateral #1 9,558’ [MB — 12,000’ MD <br/>Casing was exited on October 9, 2014 at 10:50 am CT. Casing was set approximately 14’ into the Middle Bakken, slightly above the top of the target zone. The planned target was a 19’ window, with approximately 12’ of that being a clean gamma streak with a hot marker in the middle of it. The bottom 6-7’ of target was a higher count shelf with a slight cool down slightly underneath it. When the bit came out of easing it showed a slightly higher than expected angle and corrections were immediately made. The bit came down and at 9,880’ MD entered the target zone. The bit was leveled off in the middle of the clean and remained there until a slide, combined with a likely bounce oﬂ‘ of a limestone stringer, cause the angle to come up sharply and go out the top of target at 10,730’ MD. The bit was leveled off 2—3’ above the target zone and with the BHA showing a drop on rotation drilling continued without sliding to prevent a sharp drop. The bit was trending slightly below dip and at 11,470’ MD came back into the target <br/>zone at what was believed to be dip and came to the end of this section in the very middle of the target zone. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">This section showed low gas and no oil shows at the beginning of the well until entering into the target zone. Aﬁer coming into target immediate increases in gas and oil were seen. The gas buster was put online as soon as this was seen and returns to the shaker were still showing LOGO-1,200 units with 10-15’ ﬂares observed. Oil shows started at 10% and steadily increased throughout the section with up to 70% coverage seen. At 11,600 the gas buster was closed and gas readings jumped to almost double. Water weights were kept at 9.6 to 9.8 pounds in this <br/>section. Refer to chart below to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. </p>

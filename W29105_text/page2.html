    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Parshall 405-3534H is located in Section 35, with a latitude and longitude of 47 degrees 56' 10456" N, 102 degrees, 9' 47.329" W. The legal location is 650' FSL & 2,050' FWL, Section 35 T152N R90W, Mountrail County, North Dakota. Drilling began on November 13, 2014 with surface casing set 2,140’ MD. The Parshall 405-3534H was drilled with the intention of producing oil and gas from the Middle Bakken formation. <br/>The drilling rig, H&P 524, was used to perform drilling operations. Total Drilling was the company used for MWD, and Directional Drilling. Dustin Hease and Jacob Blake with Baker Hughes Fluid Control were the mud engineers on site. Neset Consulting Services arrived on November 14, 2014 with Sid Newstrom and Mariannne Simes as onsite mud loggers. The M9 (NCS) was used to collect gas data alongside Pason as the rig interface (H&P used Totco for reporting purposes). <br/>Logging began on November 14‘“, 2014 at 3:00 AM with samples taken in thirty foot intervals throughout the vertical section of the well beginning at 7,600’ MD. Ten foot samples were caught as needed to identify formation tops. All samples were washed, cataloged, and saved for archive at the North Dakota geological Survey core library in Grand Forks, North <br/>Dakota. <br/>Vertical 7,600 ’- 9, 731 ’ MD <br/>Logging began on November 14‘“, 2014 at 7,700’ MD. The Ground elevation was 1,993’ MD with a sub of 30’ for a total KB of 2,023’ MD. Surface casing was set at 2,140’ MD using 9.625” casing. Intermediate casing was set with two different weights of HTC P-l 10 7” casing. Twenty-six pound was set at 5,825, and 32# was set at 9,727’MD. KOP was located at 8,800’ MD roughly 500 feet TVD from the target landing of 9,316’ TVD (9,727’ MD). This allowed for a radius curve of twelve degrees per one hundred feet. On November 18‘“, 2014, at 4:45 pm. A target landing of 9.73 1’ MD (TVD 9,316’) was reached with a projected inclination of 82.26 <br/>degrees. <br/>Base 0f Last Salt: 7, 716 ' MD 7, 715 ’ TVD -5, 692 ’ SS <br/>The top of the base of the last salt was noted by sample at 7,690’ MD with samples changing from a cream gray limestone to halite and conﬁrmed with a break in ROP from .6 min/ft to .4 min/ft as the salt was entered. The base of the last salt showed a total thickness of twenty six feet as observed by sample and ROP changes. Gas just above the BLS was noted at 28 units and showed no change in gas. Samples through the last salt consisted mostly of a massive halite. The base of the last salt was noted in line with the prognosis. <br/>Mission Canyon: 7,890'MD 7,889”TVD -5,866'SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was entered at 7,8 89’ TVD by sample, and conﬁrmed with a reverse drilling break from .48min/ft to .71 min/fr. Samples observed contained light tan brown to tan brown carbonaceous limestone with inter-bedded dark laminations. Oil shows in the upper portion of the Mission Canyon revealed light green yellow dull ﬂuorescence and thin to moderate </p>

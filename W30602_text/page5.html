Then every third joint for a total of 17 centralizers. <br/>Casing string(s) will be pressure tested to 0.22 psi/foot of easing string length or 1,500 psi, whichever is greater (not to exceed 70% of the internal yield strength of the casing), after cementing and prior to drilling out from under the casing shoe. <br/>The 7” intermediate casing string has been designed for service in a sour gas (H28) and salt environment. The intermediate casing will have turbolizers on the bottom three (3) joints, then every other joint to 45 degrees. Centralizers will be used every other jt from 45 degrees to KOP, then every fourth joint to the top of the Dakota sands. <br/>The 4V2“ liner will be centralized with standoff bands on every other joint.

THE PROPOSED CASING AND CEMENTIN G PROGRAM <br/>Whiting Oil & Gas Corporation (Whiting) proposes to drill a vertical hole in the NESE(2030' FSL, 710' FEL) of Section 19 in Township 147North, Range 91West to an approximate TVD of 9853' (KOP) at which time directional drilling operations will be initiated on an azimuth direction of 325° with a 12°/100 build and will end the build at 10330' TVD, 10647' MD and an inclination of 90° located 2503' FSL and 913' FEL of Section 19 in Township 147North, Range 91West, at which point the 7” intermediate casing will land. The horizontal lateral azimuth will be held at 360° thru the Three Forks Pay with a hold of 90° inclination. The projected bottom hole target location of 557’ FNL and 961’ FEL of Section 18 in Township 147North, Range 91West. Total length of lateral is approximately 7492’. <br/>A.

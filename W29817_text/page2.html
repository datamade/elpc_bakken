The surface location for the well is located 387’ FEL & 525’ FSL in Section 7 T154N R98W. The well was drilled from south to north ﬁnishing at approximately 304.48’ FNL and 39.55’ F EL in Section 6 T154N R98W of Williams County. Kelly bushing elevation was estimated at 2,436’. This well was drilled using an invert (oil based) mud system during the straight hole and build portion and salt water throughout the lateral. Jared Bryl and Thomas Osadchuk of Neset Consulting Service Inc., provided wellsite mudlogging services beginning at a depth of 8,800’ MD through the end of the Three Forks lateral, which reached a total measured depth of 20,789’ MD on February 8, 2015 at 7:30 am CST. Two sets of samples were saved to be archived at both the Hess Corporation in Houston, Texas, as well as the North Dakota Geological Survey in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical Wellbore and Curve 8,800’ — II, 781 ’ MD <br/>Wellsite geological services began at a depth of 8,800’ MD at 1:58PM CST on December 22, 2014. A NOV Penless drilling recorder was used for rate of penetration and depth. An M-9 Mudlogging Instrument was used for reading total gas and C 1 through C4. Thirty foot lagged samples were caught through the end of the curve. <br/>Kibbey Lime 8,845 ’ MD 8,844 ’ TVD -6,408’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Logging was started just above the expected top of the Kibbey Lime with samples showing a light tan Limestone. A slight change in the consistency of samples, drill rates and gamma signature occurred around 8,845’ MD. Top of the Kibbey Lime was estimated to be 8,844' TVD based off a change in samples and was conﬁrmed with gamma data. Even though top was 31’ high of original prognosis, it was consistent to other wells on the pad. Drill rates averaged 45 — 80 ft/hr, with total gas remaining fairly low at around 10 — 20 units. <br/>Charles Salt 9,002’ 1110 9,001 ’ T VD -6,565’ SS <br/>The top of the Charles was reached at approximately 9,001' TVD as drill rates nearly doubled to 90 — 120 ft/hr with salt observed in samples. Top of Charles was 29’ higher than originally expected, but was within several feet of the other wells. Drill rates continued to average 90 — 120 ft/hr while drilling in the salt, picking up off bottom occasionally to avoid getting stuck. An abundant amount of salt was observed in all samples with varying amounts of gray to gray brown dolomitic limestone. Total gas continued to average around 10 — 30 units. <br/>Base ofLast Salt 9, 714’ MD 9, 713' TVD -7,2 77’ SS </p>

Continuing to drill further down there were no more signiﬁcant drill breaks or signs of salt, as samples began to consist of dolomitic limestone with stringers of anhydrite while drilling at 20 — 80 ft/hr and total gas averaging 15 — 30 units. </p>

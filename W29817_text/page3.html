The top of the Lodgepole was picked at 10,461 ’ TVD using a slight change in dn'll rates and gamma to conﬁrm the top of Lodgepole. This was 2’ higher than expected, but no changes to landing target were made. Kick off point was reached at 10,834’ MD and a trip out of the hole was made to pick up curve assembly. <br/>Beginning the build portion, dn'll rates averaged 60 — 90 ft/hr while sliding 80 - 100 %. Samples continued to show gray argillaceous dolomitic limestone. Gamma markers in the upper portion of the formation continued suggesting target formation would come in slightly lower than anticipated. Continuing to drill ahead, gamma correlations through the middle and lower portions of the Lodgepole showed markers were tracking very close to previous wells on the pad. Drilling ahead a slight thinning occurred at the False Bakken, but was similar to what was seen <br/>on previous well and no changes to target were made. Upper Bakken 11,367’ MD 11,25 7’ TVD -8,821 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Upper Bakken was reached at approximately 1 1,367’ MD / 1 1,257’ TVD, 1’ higher than originally predicted on the prognosis. The formation top was ﬁrst estimated in real time with drill rate then reﬁned by the gamma. Samples transitioned to black carbonaceous shale with total gas increasing to average 200 — 300 units and over at connections. After reaching the base of the shale, total thickness was estimated to be 18’, 2’ thinner than originally anticipated. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,411 ’MD 11,2 75' TVD -8,839’ SS <br/>At 11,411‘ MD weight on bit increased as rates of penetration decreased, gamma began dropping below 150 API to conﬁrm the top of the Middle Bakken, 3’ higher than original expected depth. This suggested an ideal Three Forks landing target of 11,366’ TVD, 1’ higher than current landing target. Samples transitioned to gray argillaceous siltstone with drill rates between 20 — 4O ft/hr, total gas averaged 90 — 150 units. After reaching the base of the Middle Bakken, total thickness was estimated to be 45’, 1’ thicker than originally estimated. <br/>Lower Bakken 11,522 ’ MD 11,320' TVD -8,884’ SS <br/>At 1 1,522' MD weight on bit decreased as rates of penetration increased, gamma began rising above 150 API to conﬁrm the top of the Lower Bakken, 2’ higher than original anticipated top. This suggested a Three Forks landing target of 11,367’ TVD, conﬁrming current landing target was accurate. Samples transitioned to black to dark gray shale with drill rates between 30 — 50 ft/hr, with total gas between 150 — 200 units. After reaching the base of the Lower Bakken, the total thickness was estimated to be 25’, which was about as thick as expected. <br/>Three Forks 11,648’MD 11,345’ TVD -8,909’SS <br/>At 1 1,648' MD weight on bit increased as rates of penetration decreased, gamma began falling below 150 API to conﬁrm the top of the Three Forks at 2’ higher than the original estimated top. This suggested a Three Forks landing target of 11,365’ TVD, which was 2’ higher </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">After setting intermediate casing, picking up directional tools, drill pipe, and drilling cement, drilling new formation was resumed on February 2, 2015 at 2:17 am CST. While breaking in the motor, penetration rates were held to under 100 ft/hr while rotating. Frequent slides were done to build the azimuthal turn needed to begin heading to the north. While beginning the lateral several feet above center of geologic zone of interest, targets were set to reﬂect a 90.0 degree dip rate. <br/>Drilling ahead wellbore remained mostly ﬂat just above center of target window, suggesting well was at approximate dip of formation. Initial correlations were surprisingly good, conﬁrming a ﬂat dip and that well was in the upper portion of the geologic zone of interest. Samples typically showed at light blue gray to light brown, pyritic Dolomite. Drilling past 12,500’ MD well gradually moved up towards top of target window indicating formation may be toe-up. Correlations showed formation dip was slightly toe-down around 89.95 — 89.9 degrees. In an effort to move down and contact the Basal Clean marker at the bottom of the zone, target was lowered 3’ TVD. <br/>Continuing to drill ahead several slides were made in an attempt to move down in section and back into the target window. Well appear to be onto of a hard streak at the very top of the geologic zone of interest. Penetrations rates averaged 250 — 300 ft/hr, gamma averaged 70 — l 10 API with frequent ﬂuctuations and total gas averaged 250 — 400 units. Correlations were still poor to fair due to begin high in zone, but were slowly improving overall, suggesting formation dip was still averaging 89.85 — 89.95 degrees. While drilling ahead past 13,700’ MD wellbore inclination had be reduced and was moving down through the target window. As well past through the center of the window gamma quickly cooled and began averaging 40 — 60 API, indicating Basal Clean marker had been contacted. This conﬁrmed well was now in the lower portion of the geologic zone of interest. Samples made a slight color change, going from a light blue gray to light brown to eventually showing a light tan to light brown pyritic Dolomite. <br/>Over the next 800’ MD wellbore worked its way from the bottom of the target window to the top, covering most of the geologic zone of interest. This help strengthen correlations and conﬁrm target was still ideal. Samples made a gradual transition as well moved up through fonnation. A typical sample showed a light tan brown to light blue gray pyritic Dolomite with any potential shows altered due to the use of Enviro-Torq used to minimize torque and anti-foam agents. Penetration rates averaged 200 — 280 ft/hr with total gas averaging 400 — 700 units. Continuing on, wellbore inclination drastically decreased resulting in well quickly down in formation and out the bottom of the geologic zone of interest. While in the process of increasing inclination, gamma quickly increased and began averaging 115 — 1305 API. This conﬁrmed well was now several feet below the geologic zone of interest. As per pre—lateral plan protocol, target inclination was increased 1 degree above dip in order to move well up and back into zone. Over the next 400’ MD several attempts were made, before wellbore inclination was increased enough to move back up through formation and into the lower portion of the geologic zone of interest. </p>

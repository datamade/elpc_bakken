    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Lateral II,I85’—21,618’MD <br/>Drilling ofthe lateral began on October 14'“, 2014 at 7:44 AM CDT at 1 1,185’ MD. The wellbore came out of the shoe ~3—4 TVD above the target window, which was entered at roughly 1 1,275’ MD. Initial dip for the 10’ target window was set at 89.97 degrees <br/>Drilling within the target window commenced with a gradual cut down through the entirety of the 10’ zone, and once the wellbore tagged the lower reach of the window drilling moved up to the center of the target at approximately 12,600’ MD and the formation dip was adjusted down slightly to 89.96 degrees based on gamma changes seen as the wellbore entered and exited the high gamma marker at the bottom of the zone. Drilling continued along the center of the target window when formation dip was further adjusted down to 89.89 degrees based on local dip calculations at a MD of 13,720’ and the wellbore tracked along in within our targeted cool gamma marker. At a MD of 14,960’ targets were projected to a dip of 89.99 degrees and a ﬂattening of the formation was observed in the gamma data. Progression in the wellbore showed a change in formation dip to 90.08 and targets were updated at 15,427’ MD based on structure maps and clean gamma marker repeats. <br/>On October 17‘“, 2014, rig crews tripped out at a MD of 15,810’ due to poor penetration rates, and drilling resumed the morning of October 18“, 2014 with a preservation of a 90.08 degree formation dip at 15,928’ MD. Based on structure mapping, targets were re-projected to 89.77 degrees at 16,428’ MD to reﬂect a down dip in the formation and subsequent target change at 16,904’ MD the following day when the formation dip ﬂattened slightly to 89.88 degrees based on local dip calculations. On October 19‘“, 2014, at a MD of 17,103’, rig crews tripped to the shoe and changed out the MWD tool Via wireline operations. After tripping in to resume drilling ahead, rig crews tripped out to the top of curve on October 20‘“, 2014, at a MD of 17,121’ and again utilized a wireline operation to change out the MWD tool. After transmission issues continued after a short trip beyond the curve section, rig crews performed a full trip out on October 20‘“, 2014, at a MD of 17,121’ and changed out the mud motor on the bottom hole assembly. Drilling resumed on the evening of October 215‘, 2014. <br/>Based on assessment of the ﬂattening formation dip, targets were projected at a MD of 17,995” to 89.93 degrees. Due to issues with tool orientation during directional drilling, rig crews tripped out to the surface on October 24‘“, 2014 at a MD of 18,825’ to change out the bottom hole assembly and drilling resumed on October 25, 2014. Once drilling ahead, targets were held at 89.94 degrees at a MD of 18, 867’, until a signiﬁcant high gamma zone was encountered as the wellbore exited the target window and drilling continued above dip. As the direction team worked to bring the wellbore back down into the target window, targets were re— projected and dip was lowered at a MD of 19,250’ to 89.37 degree target for 19,500’ MD and 89.7 degrees at 19,500’ MD. At a MD of 19,950’, after recalibrating the gamma sensor and recorrelating gamma signatures, local dip calculations prompted a ﬂattening of the dip to 89.83 degrees and targets were re-projected. Finally, targets were projected at dip of 89.9 to the TD prognosis of 21,670’ MD to reﬂect formation dip, calculated from gamma signatures and inferred from structure maps. <br/>Throughout the lateral section, samples were Siltstone, generally light to medium gray brown, tan gray, and cream gray, very ﬁne to ﬁne grained, soft to ﬁrm, subround, poor to fair intergranular porosity, slightly to moderately argillaceous, dolomitic cementation, and microsucrosic. Higher in the formation, samples contained 25-45% platy blue gray and blue green Shale. Oi1 shows were generally even ﬂuorescence, bright to dull yellow or dull to very </p>

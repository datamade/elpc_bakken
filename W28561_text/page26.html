    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Bailey 4-24H2 is a Middle Bakken well located on Section 25 T150N R97W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The initial phase is a vertical and curve, landing 49.29 feet within the Three Forks Formations, 2nd bench. The Bailey 4-24H2 spudded on September 7, 2014 and reached a total depth of 21,61 8’ MD on October 27th, 2014. The Bottom Hole Location is 231.51' FNL & 1,691 .41‘ FEL Section 13 T1 SON R97W, McKenzie County, North <br/>Dakota. Wellsite geological services began at 8,500 feet in the Charles Formation at 4:37 AM <br/>CST on September 12‘“, 2014. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected during the straight hole <br/>and curve while ninety foot lagged samples were caught during the lateral. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the Continental Corporation’s ofﬁces in Oklahoma <br/>City, Oklahoma. Vertical 8,500 ’ — 11, I85 ’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 8,500 feet in the Charles formation on September 12‘“, 2014 at 4:37 AM CST. Drill rates averaged 1.23 minutes per foot throughout the vertical section, with the gas averaging 51 units, with the highest spikes coming from the upper Bakken shale at 121 <br/>units. <br/>Base aft/1e Last Salt 9,154’ MD 9,153. 05’ TVD -6,880. 05’ SS <br/>The Base ofthe Last Salt was encountered at 9,153.05’ TVD and 6,880.05’ SS, 12’ high to prognosis but only 2’ higher than the adjacent Budahn H4 well. The Base of the Last Salt was picked by the last sample with salt present, an ROP change, and gamma. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The top of the Mission Canyon was picked at 9,368.05’ TVD, with 0 delta to prognosis. The pick was based off of the gamma marker and sample change, along with differential pressure. Drill rates in the Mission Canyon averaged 1.12 minutes per foot with gas up to 217 units. Typical samples were gray to dark gray limestone, wackestone, argillaceous, poorly indurated, soft to ﬁrm, no to poor intergranular porosity. Cuts and ﬂuorescence shows were sporadic and questionable due to the oil-based mud. <br/>Lodgepole 9,931 ’ MD 9,930.34 ’ TVD -7, 65 7. 04 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Lodgepole was picked at 9,928.45’ TVD, about 1.55 feet high to prognosis. The pick was based off of the gamma marker and sample change, along with differential pressure. Drill rates in the Lodgepole above KOP averaged 1.09 minutes per foot with gas averaging 51 units. Typical samples were gray to dark gray LIMESTONE: Gray to light gray, medium to light brown, creamy brown to tan, ﬁrm slightly to moderately calcareous, no to poor porosity. Cuts and fluorescence shows were sporadic and questionable due to the oilbased mud. </p>

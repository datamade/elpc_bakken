The following assurances apply: <br/>1. The well is equipped with new 29#, 7" casing from surface to 11,138' MDI 10,784' TVD with an API burst rating of 8,160psi/11,220psi <br/>2. The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.80* API burst rating to determine the max pressure. <br/>3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment. <br/>4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during the flowback than during the frac job. <br/>5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates. <br/>6. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing. <br/>7. A 300# gauge will be installed on surface casing during flowback operation. <br/>                                             <br/>                      <br/>XTO Ener , Inc. 303-397-3735 P.O.

DST and Goring Program 1. A mud log will be run from Base of Last Salt to TD 8: on all laterals: Mudlog to include: total gas chromatograph and sample cuttings - <br/>10' sample intervals in vertical hole 8. 30’ intervals in laterals. A CBL/GR log will be run from deepest free-fall depth in 7 inch casing to surface. An MWD GRIROP log will also be run from KOP (where the CBL will tie into) to T0 of lateral. 2. Open hole logs are not anticipated for this well <br/>3. No DSTs are planned at this time. <br/>H25 H28 may be present In the Mission Canyon Formation. H28 Trailer will be rigged up prior to penetrating the Mission Canyon through running and cementing the 7"casmg Maximum Formation Pressure and Temp 1. Normal formation pressure gradient is expected (up to 0.5 psi/ft or 9.6 ppg) from surface to the Bakken Shale. The Bakken Shale, Bakken Middle Member. and Three Forks may be over pressured up as much as 0.66 psi/ft (12.8 ppg). <br/>2. The maidmum anticipated BHST is 250 degrees F. or less. <br/>BOP Equipment Requirements See attached diagram detailing BOPE speciﬁcations. 1. Rig will be equipped with upper and lower keliy cocks with handles available. <br/>2. inside BOP and TlW valves will be available to use on all sizes and threads of DP used on well. <br/>3. BOP accumulator will have enough capacity to close HCR valve, close all rams plus annular preventer & retain minimum 01200 psi above precharge on the closing manifold without the use of closing pumps. The ﬂuid reservoir capacity shall be at least double the usable ﬂuid volume of the accumulator system capacity & the ﬂuid level shall be mainatained at manufacturer's recommendation. There will be 2 additional sources of power for the closing pumps (electric and air). Sufficient N2 bottles will be available and will be recharged when pressure falls below manufacturer's minimum <br/>4. BOP ram prevenlers will be tested to 5.000 psi using a test plug when initially installed and after 7 inch casing is nippled up and at 30 day intervals. Test BOP & casing strings to 1.500 psi just prior to drilling out 9-5/8" and 7" casing shoes. Function test rams and hydraulicain operated remote choke line valve daily (preferably at every crew change). </p>

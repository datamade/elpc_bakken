    <p class="styleSans60.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The planned top of the 4.5” 1 1.6” production liner will be 50-100 ft above the kick off point. This liner will be cemented throughout the lateral and a wet shoe sub will be set at the toe of the liner. The frac string will be 12.75# P-l 10 with TSHP threads and stung into a PBR run with the liner hanger prior to the fracturing treatment. Current plans are for 28 stages using a plug and perf approach. <br/>. ABNORMAL CONDITIONS <br/>No abnormal temperatures or pressures are anticipated. Hydrogen sulﬁde (1128) may be encountered in the Mission Canyon Formation at a TVD of approximately 8988'. Safety equipment will be in operation at approximately 8488'. <br/>A Hydrogen Sulﬁde (HzS) Contingency Plan is being prepared and will be submitted under separate cover for review and approval. As a safety precaution, the rig sub-structure will remain open during drilling operations to allow natural convection to dissipate any accumulations of hydrogen sulﬁde gas. Should H23 concentrations exceed 20 ppm, a “bug blower” fan will be activated at that position in order to dissipate the concentration of H23 gas to acceptable levels. <br/>Maximum anticipated bottom hole pressure equals approximately 5740psi (calculated at 0.55 psi/foot at Middle Bakken target depth, 10,437’) and maximum anticipated surface pressure equals approximately 3444psi (bottom hole pressure minus the pressure of a partially evacuated hole calculated at 0.22 psi/foot at Three Forks target depth). The intermediate design casing will be run and cemented before drilling the target lateral. <br/>Reservoir temperature is anticipated to be 244°F. </p>

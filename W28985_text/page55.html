The Lodgepole was picked based on sample, gamma, and rate of penetration changes. The samples consisted of Limestone: Light gray to gray brown, brown, light brown, tan, ﬁrm to brittle, packstone, carbonaceous, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow, green ﬂuorescence, slow streaming to a weak cloudy yellow, green cut. The decision was made to trip out of the hole and pick up the curve assembly at 10,598‘ MD on November 16, 2014, around 10:40 AM., CST. Reached bottom and resumed drilling ahead on November 17, 2014 around 11:40 AM. CST. The kick-off point was reached at 10,612' MD on November 17, 2014, around 12:00 PM., CST. The landing target was set at 11,053” TVD, 17’ feet into the Middle Bakken. The landing target was not adjusted. The rate of penetration averaged 1.04 min/ft. and background gas averaged around 113 units. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 11,119’ MD 11,015’ TVD -8,694’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was next being observed. The Upper Bakken Shale was picked based on gamma and samples. The samples changed to Shale: Black, dark brown, blocky, ﬁssile, and gritty to smooth, argillaceous, ﬁrm to hard, brittle, no porosity, no ﬂuorescence, and instant fair streaming cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 1.04 min/ﬂ and background gas <br/>was around 640 units, with a max of 955 units. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,124'MD 10,949’ TVD -8,520' SS </p>

This formation consisted of Limestone: Gray, light gray, creamgray, brown, light brown, tan, soft to ﬁrm, silty, microcrystalline, argillaceous, slightly dolomitic, poor to fair intercrystalline porosity; even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was .89 min/ft and background gas was around 550 units with a max of2160 units. The TD ofthe curve was reached at 11,350' MD on November 18, 2014 around 6:40 A.M., CST. The target zone in the Middle Bakken ranged between 15’ and 25’ feet below the Upper Bakken Shale. </p>

Reached bottom and began ' drilling ahead out of casing on November 21, 2014 around 3: 15 AM. The gas has been around 21 <br/>units with a max of 55 units. A max trip gas of 38 units was seen. The samples once they drilled out consisted Limestone: Light brown, tan, light gray, ﬁrm, silty, microcrystalline, carbonaceous, slightly dolomitic, fair intercrystalline porosity; even dull yellow/ green fluorescence, faint streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was around 0.44 min/ﬂ, and the background gases averaged 175 units with a max of 518 units. While in the target window the gamma averaged between high 60’s to mid 80’s API. The gamma API seen at a maker near the top of the target window averaged between Low 80’s to High 90’s API. <br/>From 13,000’ MD to 15,000’ MD, the rate of penetration averaged 0.42 min/ft.

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Bismarck 7-9H well is a Brooklyn prospect well located in Section 9 T155N R98W in Williams County, North Dakota. The Bismarck 7—9H is a horizontal well targeting the Middle Bakken Porosity, crossing Section 9 and 4. The Bismarck 7-9H well was spud on November 13, 2014 and drilling was completed on November 26, 2014. Lateral #1 was drilled to a TD of 20,945’ MD. The surface location was set at 265' FNL & 2,245‘ FWL, with lateral #1 ending coordinates 0f248.23' FNL & 2,473.17‘ FWL of Section 4. Joseph Magnan and Dennis Corwin, of Neset Consulting Service, provided mudlogging and geological services beginning on November 15, 2014 in the vertical hole at 9,300’ MD in the Top Charles formation through TD at 20,945’ MD in the Middle Bakken Member. Noram Gas Detection Services were utilized throughout the vertical, curve, and horizontal part of the well. Thirty and One Hundred foot lagged samples were caught, washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey core library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Sample quality was poor to good during the well. Oil and gas shows were poor to fair while in zone. <br/>Top Charles <br/>Mud logging services began at 9,200’ MD in the Top Charles Formation on November 15, 2014 around 5:40 PM., CST. The top of the Charles samples consisted of Limestone: Gray, light gray, light brown, blocky, soft to ﬁrm in part, micro to cryptocrystalline, anydritic, argillaceous, poor to moderate induration, poor intercrystalline porosity, even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, no out Then the samples changed to various thicknesses of Anhydrite: White, offwhite, blocky, soft, poor intergranular porosity, Limestone: Brown, light brown, tan, Salt: Clear, cloudy white, cloudy in part, blocky. The average rate of penetration was 0.64 min/ft and the background gasses averaged 86 units. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Base of the Last Salt was observed next and was picked based on rate of penetration and sample changes. The Base of the Last Salt samples consisted of Dolomite: Gray, light gray, blocky, soft to ﬁrm in part, cryptocrystalline, argillaceous, poor to moderate induration, slightly calcareous, 10% anhydrite: white, off-white, blocky, trace light brown, brown limestone, poor intercrystalline porosity, even scattered off-white ﬂuorescence, no cut. Then samples changed to Limestone: Brown, light brown, tan, packstone, carbonaceous, ﬁrm, moderate induration, slightly dolomitic, trace anhydrite, poor intergranular porosity, even yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.35 min/ft and the background gas averaged 30 units. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,686'MD 9,685 ’ T VD -7,364'SS <br/>The Mission Canyon was next to be drilled. The Mission Canyon was picked from rate of penetration, and sample changes along with Gamma. The formation consisted of Limestone: Brown, light brown, tan, blocky, packstone, carbonaceous, ﬁrm, moderate induration, poor intergranular porosity, even dull yellow/ green ﬂuorescence, faint thin streaming weak cloudy cut. The average rate of penetration was 0.66 min/ft and the background gases averaged 81 units. </p>

It is a single lateral horizontal well targeting the lower portion of the Middle Bakken siltstone as well as tan sandstone, drilled on a 2560—acre spacing unit. The well was spudded on January 4, 2015 and reached a total depth of 20,595' at 8:30 AM CDT on January 29, 2015‘ Clint Wold and Nevan Larson were onsite for well site supervision, along with Scott Strahm and Stephanie Connole representing Neset Consulting Service, Inc for wellsite geological services. </p>

Two man geological services were used for the vertical, curve and lateral. A Total Gas detector was utilized for gas analysis. Samples were caught every thirty feet throughout the vertical section and curve. Samples were caught every ﬁﬁy feet through the lateral. All samples caught were saved to be archived at the ND Core and Sample Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical Section <br/>The Base of the Last Salt, the main correlatory marker to this point came in at 9,340’ MD and 9,333’ TVD, 1’ low to the prognosis. <br/>RADCLIFF 9,389’ MD 9,382 ’ T VD - 7,31 7’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon top was picked at 9,389’ MD and 9,382’ TVD a drop in ROP, from .57 min/ﬂ to .73 min/ﬂ a spike in differential pressure and torque and a change in sample texture and color. The Radcliff came in 1’ low of the prognosis and drilled consistently with ROP between .36 and .77 min/ﬂ. Samples in the Radcliff were primarily blocky argillaceous limestone that was brown to gray brown with traces off white to light cream gray anhydrite and medium gray dolomite throughout. There were no signiﬁcant shows in the Mission Canyon. <br/>MISSION CANYON 9,525 ’ MD 9,518’ TVD -7,453 ’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon top was picked at 9,525’ MD and 9,518’ TVD a drop in ROP, from .48 min/ﬂ to .68 min/ﬁ a spike in differential pressure and torque and a change in sample texture and color. The Mission Canyon came in even of the prognosis and drilled consistently with ROP between .16 and 1.7 min/ﬂ. Samples in the Mission Canyon were primarily blocky argillaceous limestone that was brown to gray brown with traces off white to light cream gray anhydrite and medium gray dolomite throughout.

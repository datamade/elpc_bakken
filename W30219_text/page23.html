At 11,800’ MD Dip was changed to 90.15 degrees while bit tracked from E marker to the middle of the target window for the next 900’ MD. At 12,700’ MD Dip was changed to 90.0 degrees while the bit dropped below the E and F markers for the next 500’ MD. At 13,200’ MD the dip was changed to 90.4 degrees for the next 500’ of MD while the bit tracked the E marker in the Three Forks formation. At 13,700’ MD the dip was changed to 90.75 degrees for the next 700’ of MD aﬁer gamma markers showed the bit tracking just below the F marker. At 14,400’ MD the dip was changed to 90.35 degrees for the next 400’ of MD aﬁer gamma markers showed the bit tracking above the E marker in the Three Forks formation At 14,800’ MD the dip was changed to 90.25 degrees for the next 900’ of MD aﬁer gamma markers showed the bit tracking the upper half of the target window. At 15,700’ MD the dip was changed to 89.5 degrees for the next 600’ of MD while the bit tracked the lower half of the target window. At 16,300’ MD the dip was changed to 90.0 degrees for the next 700’ of MD aﬁer gamma markers showed the bit tracking the middle of the target window in the Three Forks formation At 16,589’ MD a trip was preformed to change out BHA due to MWD failure on March 14, 2015 at 4:00 PM MST. Once BHA was changed out and bottom was reached, lateral was resumed at 7:30 AM MST on March 15, 2015. At 17,000’ MD the dip was changed to 90.55 degrees for the next 400’ of MD while the bit tracked from the lower half of the target window to the E marker. At 17,400’ MD the dip was changed to 89.6 degrees for the next 400’ of MD aﬁer gamma markers showed the bit tracking from the F marker to just above the top of the target window. At 17,800’ MD the dip was changed to 89.95 degrees for the next 500’ of MD aﬁer gamma markers showed the bit tracking above the Top Target Window marker in the Three Forks formation. At 18,814’ MD a trip was preformed to change out BHA due to inadequate build rates and close proximity to the top of the Three Forks formation based on a 89.95 degree down dip on March 17, 2015 at 4:30 AM MST. Once BHA was changed out and bottom was reached, lateral was resumed at 7:20 AM MST on March 18, 2015, with slides preformed to work the bit back into the target window It was observed that dip had not continued the downward trend and that bit was not as close to the Upper Bakken Dolomite. At 18,300’ MD the dip was changed to 90.55 degrees for the next 700’ of MD after reviewing gamma markers with target window changes made. At 19,000’ MD the dip was changed to 90.0 degrees for the next 500’ of MD aﬁer gamma markers showed the bit tracking the transition between the E and F markers. At 19,500’ MD the dip was changed to 90.9 degrees for the next 700’ of MD while the bit tracked the E marker. At 20,200’ MD the dip was changed to 90.9 degrees for the remainder of the well, while the bit tracked from the E marker to the lower half of the target window in the Three Forks formation. The Eckert Foundation 152-102—22-15—10TFH Lateral reached a total depth of 20,686’ MD on March 20, 2015 at 12:20 PM MST. Drilling rates in the Three Forks formation ranged from 0.06—7.93 minutes per foot with an average of 0.61 minutes per foot. The bottom hole location was projected at MD 20686 / INC 91.40 / AZ 359.80 / TVD 10914.58 / VS 10050.48. </p>

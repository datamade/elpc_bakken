    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The curve for the South lateral was landed at a measured depth of 1 1,3 56’ at 9:55 am. CST on December 11, 2014 with 89 degrees projected to the bit at a true vertical depth of 11,155’. Casing for the South Lateral was set at 11,343’ MD. <br/>South Lateral 11,356 ’ — 20, 51 0' MD Day 1 11,356’ — 11,470’ MD <br/>A Baker Hughes mud motor and Security bit were used for the South Lateral. The TIH began until tagging cement where the cement, Float & Shoe and ten feet of new formation were drilled to perform the FIT test. After ﬁnishing with the FIT test drilling resumed with the South lateral with casing exited at a MD of 11,343’ at 3:50 am. CST on December 13, 2014. Drilling continued with the wellbore exiting casing at 88 degrees dropping in TVD towards the lower portion of the Middle Bakken target window. Slides were done to begin working on the planned directional turn as well as to slow the drop in TVD of the wellbore. Penetration rates averaged around 150 — 200 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 50 — 60 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 500 — 800 units with connection gases reaching as high as 909 units. The samples seen in the lower portion of the formation exhibited a cream gray tan/cream gray dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Day 2 11,470’ —14,s50’ MD <br/>Drilling continued with the wellbore exiting casing at around 88 degrees and continue to drop in TVD through the target interval seeing the A to C faces transition. As the wellbore continued to drop through the formation at around 87 degrees seeing the D faces the wellbore was leveled out about 8’ below the base of the Middle Bakken target window. The directional turn was ﬁnished aﬁer reaching 180 degrees and surveys returned to every ninety feet. After seeing the slides the wellbore began to build in TVD reaching the base of the target window seeing the D to C faces transition giving the formation a calculated dip rate of 90. 15 degrees with the wellbore slowly building in TVD towards the upper portion of the Middle Bakken target window. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 250 — 300 ﬂ/hr while rotating and around 120 — 150 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 400 — 600 units with connection gases reaching as high as 690 units. The samples seen throughout the lower portion of the Middle Bakken exhibited a light to medium tan/cream brown dolomite with an even to spotty yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. </p>

As the upper warm gamma from the A faces was seen slides were done and the wellbore was rolled over after reaching about 2 feet above the top of the Middle Bakken target interval. The wellbore reentered the top of the target window and the repeat section of clean gamma was seen ﬁom the A to C faces contact giving the formation a calculated dip rate of 90. 14 degrees. The wellbore continued to slowly drop through the target </p>

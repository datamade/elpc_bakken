The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Sect. 43-02-03-55 of NDAC. is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an Initial rig that Is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a wall to total depth but is not Intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of. or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well.

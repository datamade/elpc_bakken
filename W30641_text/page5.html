THE PROPOSED CASING AND CEMENTING PROGRAM <br/>Whiting Oil & Gas Corporation (Whiting) proposes to drill a vertical hole in the SWSW(275' FSL, 265' FWL) of Section 22 in Township l49North, Range 92West to an approximate TVD of 10065' (KOP) at which time directional drilling operations will be initiated on an azimuth direction of 315° with a 12°/100 build and will end the build at 10542' TVD, 11482' MD and an inclination of 90° located 1123' FSL and 500' FEL of Section 21 in Township 149North, Range 92West, at which point the 7” intermediate casing will land. The horizontal lateral azimuth will be held at 360° thru the Three Forks with a hold of 90° inclination. The projected bottom hole target location of 251' FNL and 973' F EL of Section 16 in Township 149North, Range 92West. Total length of lateral is approximately 9250'. <br/>A. Casing Program: New casing with Design criteria Pb-1.0 Pc-1.125 Sj'1.8 </p>

    <p class="styleSans48.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The surface casing will have centralizers on the bottom three (3) joints with a stop ring utilized midway on the shoe joint. Then every third joint for a total of l 7 centralizers. <br/>Casing string(s) will be pressure tested to 0.22 psi/foot of casing string length or 1,500 psi, whichever is greater (not to exceed 70% of the internal yield strength of the casing), after cementing and prior to drilling out from under the casing shoe. <br/>The 7” intermediate casing string has been designed for service in a sour gas (H28) and salt environment. The intermediate casing will have turbolizers on the bottom three (3) joints, then every other joint to 45 degrees. Centralizers will be used every other jt from 45 degrees to KOP, then every fourth joint to the top of the Dakota sands. <br/>The 4‘/2“ liner will be centralized with standoff bands on every other joint. B. Cementing Program: <br/>Surface Casing - Lead with approximately 500 sx Econocem W1 + 0.25 pps Poly E Flake cement mixed at 11.5 ppg (yield I 2.98 ﬁs/sx). <br/>Tail with approximately 225 sx SwiﬁCem + 0.25 pps Poly E Flake mixed at 14.2 ppg (yield = 1.49 ﬁs/sx). Cement will be circulated back to surface with 40% excess. Top out if necessary. </p>

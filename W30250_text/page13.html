    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation Jones #11-8XH was drilled as a single lateral horizontal with the primary objective being in the Middle Bakken formation. This well is located in the NWNW Section 8 T154N R91W of Mountrail County, North Dakota. The Jones #1 l-8XH was spud on January 4, 2015 and reached a total depth for the vertical & curve at 10,290’ MD on January 20, 2015, seven days from spud. Total depth of the North West Lateral was reached at 20,159’ MD on January 24, 2015, eleven days from spud. This well was drilled using an invert based mud system for the vertical & curve and Brine for the lateral. Shawn Morrow and Freddy Roberts of Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided wellsite mudlogging services, beginning at a depth of 8,200’ in the Charles Formation, through total depth in the Middle Bakken target. A NCS Total Gas detector was utilized for monitoring gas. Thirty foot lagged samples in the vertical & curve and one hundred foot lagged samples in the North West Lateral were caught and saved to be archived at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 8,200’ — 9, 446’ MD <br/>Mudlogging began in the Charles Formation at a measured depth of 8,200’. Penetration rates throughout the Charles averaged around 180 - 250 ft/hr through the salt benches and around 150 — 180 ft/hr throughout the limestone and anhydrite benches. Background gases in the Charles averaged around 39 — 50 units with connection gases reaching as high as 65 units. The samples throughout the Charles exhibited alternating benches of anhydrite and limestone with occasional shale and dolomite present with the <br/>salt benches showing primarily a clear, frosted angular salt. The Charles was evaluated while drilling ahead. </p>

Penetration rates through the last salt averaged around 200 - 240 ﬁ/hr with 25K weight on bit and penetration rates through the remainder of the Charles averaged around 120 - 180 ft/hr with 35K weight on bit. The samples throughout the lower portion of the Charles exhibited primarily limestone and anhydrite with traces of cream tan dolomite and gray shale present. The remainder of the Charles was drilled out and the Ratcliffe and Midale formations were encountered. Penetration rates through the Ratcliffe and Midale averaged around 150 - 180 ﬁ/hr with the samples showing primarily a gray tan limestone with layers of anhydrite and occasional cream tan dolomite present. The Ratcliffe and Midale formations were evaluated while drilling ahead. </p>

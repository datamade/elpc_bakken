    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">target window seeing the cleaner gamma from the C faces. The wellbore continued to build in TVD exiting the top of the C faces and into the upper warm gamma from the C to A faces transition. The wellbore was dropped in TVD back into the C faces and continued to track the clean gamma from the C faces Throughout the day the wellbore continued to track the A to C faces contact with slides done to work on keeping the wellbore at or slightly below dip. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 240 w 250 ft/hr while rotating and around 50 - 100 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 600 — 1,000 units with connection gases reaching as high as 2,396 units. The samples seen in the clean section of the B faces exhibited a cream tan/cream gray tan sandstone with traces of limestone and siltstone present and an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow/instant streaming cloudy yellow green cut. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Day 4 17,650’ —20,159’ MD <br/>Drilling continued today with the wellbore steadily tracking the lower portion of the Middle Bakken target interval. As the wellbore would build in TVD towards the transition between the A and C faces it appeared to deﬂect down and slowly drop in TVD towards the lower portion of the target window again. This continued throughout the day and evening seeing the clean gamma from the C faces and a slightly cooler section as the wellbore rubbed the lower portion of the target window. TD of the NW lateral was reached at 20,159' MD at 11:35 pm. CST on 1-24-15. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 230 - 300 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 50 - 80 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 400 — 700 units with connection gases reaching as high as 1,504 units. The samples seen in the lower portion of the target continued to exhibit a cream tan/cream gray tan sandstone with traces of limestone and siltstone present and an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Total depth of the North West lateral was called at 20,159’ MD for the Jones #118XH with the wellbore ending in the lower portion of the Middle Bakken target interval. The formation throughout the lateral had an overall estimated dip rate of 89.4 degrees Total depth of the North West Lateral was reached at 20,159’ MD at 11:35 pm. CST on January 24, 2015 with 9,879’ of open horizontal hole drilled. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The Whiting Oil and Gas Corp. Jones #11-8XH was drilled successﬁilly reaching a total depth of the North West lateral at a MD of 20, 159' giving this well 9,879' of open horizontal hole. This well is currently awaiting completion. <br/>Shawn Morrow Wellsite Mudlogger </p>

KOG is willing to plant trees near the well Site to enhance the view to the shedgarea. Steel ballards will be placed on the crossing that will stop any trucks from turning off of the lease road onto County Rd 15. KOG is willing to have securityltrafflc guard stationed where the lease road will cross County Rd 15 during the drilling and completion operations. This will aid in trafﬁc control and preVent heavy trucks from driving on County Rd 15. Gas Disposition: The P Wood wells will be connected to a dedicated ONEOK 14” line. which will move gas to the Epplng Station. There is currently 7-8 MMcf of additional capacity at the Epping Station. ONEOK is building a compressor station 8 of Stockyard Creek to take 30 Mllllcf and free up capacity at Epping. This is anticipated to come on line Aug. 2014, before completion of the P Wood wells. Therefore, these will be hocked up upon completion, limiting ﬂaring to short-term emergency situations. Kodiak will, mitigate operational noise by doing the following: a. Requiring mufflers on all operating equipment, no straight pipes are allowed. b. Minimize the use of air horns, especially during the night. c. Minimize the clanging of pipe by use of pad drilling. We. will pick up and rack all usable tubulars as will fit in the derrick. Parking forklifts so that the first movement is always forward to minimize backing indicators. e. Guards will explain to all truck traffic that the speed limit is 20 mph’and no jakos allowed. <br/>Company { Telephone Number ‘ Kodiak Oil & Gas USA , Inc. 303 592-8075 FOR STATE use ONLY <br/>1625 Broadwa , Suite 250 City Zip Code Date Denver > R 80202 7 r / / I / I a 4.44 A 4 a . .1 A <br/>we Engineering Technician <br/>          <br/>     <br/>            <br/>        <br/>  <br/>                     <br/>                               <br/>            <br/>Signal n .

The background gases averaged 293 units with a max of 569 units. The bit re-entered the target window at 13,109’ MD, 11,120.13’ TVD. This point gave an estimated 89.8 degree dip. The formation was projected out at 90 degrees. Next the Internal 1 was entered at 13,573' MD, 11,128.01' TVD. Then the bit re-entered the target window at 13,918' MD, 11,126.12' TVD, showing an estimated dip of 90.3 degrees. The formation dip pro-ected was 90 degrees. <br/>From 15,000' MD to 17,000 MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.34 min/ft. The background gases averaged 176 units with a max of 327 units. The well bore had encountered the top of the target window from 15,227’ MD, 11,123.21’ TVD to 15,414’ MD, 11,125.83’ TVD. These points had shown an 89.2 degree dip. The formation was projected out at 90 degrees. Next the Internal 1 was entered at 15,773’ MD, 11,132.76’ TVD. This point had shown a 90.15 degree dip. Next the well bore re—entered the target window at 16,272‘ MD, 11,132.76' TVD, showing an estimated dip of 91 degrees. Then the bit went out the top of the target window at 16,575’ MD, 11,116.39‘ TVD this point had shown that the formation had leveled back out to 90 degrees <br/>From 17,000' MD to 19,000’ MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.41 min/ﬂ. The background gases averaged 146 units with a max of 245 units. The well bore reentered the target window at 17,257' MD, 11,115.98' TVD. This point has sown the formation dip to be around 90 degrees. The formation was projected ahead at 9015 degrees. Then the well bore entered the Internal 1 at 17,862’ MD, 11,118.89’ TVD, showing an estimated dip of 90.7 degrees. Then the bit re-entered the target window at 18,258’ MD, 11,114’ TVD. This point had veriﬁed an estimated dip of 90.7 degrees. The formation was projected out at 90.5 degrees. Then the bit went out the top of the target window at 18,390' Ivﬂ), 11,107.87' TVD, showing an 892 degree dip change. The decision was then made to continue to drill ahead just above the target window in the Secondary Target window. The Secondary Target window ranged from 8 feet to 18 feet below the top of the Three Forks. The plan drilling ahead was to follow an estimated 90.] degree dip. <br/>From 19,000’ MD to 21,010’ MD the rate of penetration averaged 0.57 min/ft. The background gases averaged 148 units with a max of 261 units. The well bore reentered the target window at 19,406’ MD, 11,105.51 TVD. This point had shown an estimated dip of 90.1 degrees. Then the top of the target window was encountered from 19,640’ MD 11,099.75’ TVD, to 19,811’ MD, 11,100.83’ TVD. These points had shown a 5 foot roll up in the formation. Next the top of the target window was encountered from 20,145' MD, 11,098.83' TVD to 20,359‘ MD, 11,099.97' TVD. These points had shown an estimated dip of 89.7 degrees. The formation was projected out at 90.3 degrees. Then the Internal 1 was encountered from 20,589' MD, 11,103.94' TVD to 20,647' MD, 11,103.53' TVD. Overall the estimated dip was 90.2 degrees. Ceased drilling at 20,810' MD from 2:30 AM to 4:45 AM due to MWD tool failure until the decision was made to drill ahead without gamma and surveys to TD. The TD of the well was reached at 221,010' MD around 7:00 AM CST on December 6, 2014. </p>

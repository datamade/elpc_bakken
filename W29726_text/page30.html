The lithology of the Middle Bakken formation was sandstone and siltstone that was gray, tan gray, and dark gray that was ﬁne to very ﬁne grained. Rate of penetration was an average of 39 11/111: Gas was an average of 589 units with a max of 1139 units through the Middle Bakken formation. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Casing point was reached @ 11,373' MD on November 23, 2014 at 2:50 PM CST <br/>in the Middle Bakken. Drilling ceased with a true vertical depth of 11,152.18 feet and measured depth of 11,373 feet, landing 16.1 feet into the Middle Bakken formation. <br/>Lateral Section <br/>Drilling resumed on December 12, 2014 at 4:30 AM CST in the l\/ﬁddle Bakken <br/>formation. There was a planned lateral turn for the Eide 41-13-3H. The lateral turn to the south was started at 11,422 feet on December 12, 2014 at 6:05 AM CST. The lateral turn was ﬁnished at 12,560’ MD on December 12, 2014 at 8:30 PM CST, after 30 degrees. According to the structure map, it was believed this well would average a 90.2 degree up dip — expecting formation to come up a total of approximately 35 feet throughout the lateral section. Overall, formation trended up slightly throughout the well. In total, formation came up approximately 8 feet in total vertical depth. Mudloggers used B/C and C/D facie contacts along with clean gamma signatures in the middle of the 10 foot target window to correlate dip and determine structural position. <br/>The Eide 41-13-3H lateral was completed in two runs using two Reed SKS 16M style drill bits. The decision was made at 17749' MD to TOOH for MWD tool failure at <br/>8:00 PM CST on December 14, 2014. Drilling was resumed at 2:20 PM CST on December 15, 2014. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The lithology of the Middle Bakken formation was siltstone that was relatively medium to dark in color. The majority of the Eide 41-13-3H lateral section was drilled out of the target window. Throughout the C facies gray, dark gray, and tan gray siltstone were the dominate colors found. As the wellbore trended up into the B facies, the dominate colors were slightly lighter in color and ranged from light gray to tan gray and cream gray. The footage spent out of the bottom of the target window; in the D facies, samples were mostly dark in color and ranged from gray to dark gray to gray brown siltstone. Along with gamma interpretations, these subtle differences in color, as we transitioned through the zone, made it possible to distinguish structural position. <br/>Rate of penetration was an average of 188 ﬁ/hr. Gas was an average of 254 units with a max of 4002 units through the Middle Bakken formation, giving a consistent ﬂare from 18,000 feet measured depth on. </p>

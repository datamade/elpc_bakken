At this time we cannot provide you a physical address for the requested location, however, the permit number (NDIC code) assigned to your project will serve as the as the primary identifier for addressing and emergency purposes. <br/>According to North Dakota Century Code § 57-40.6-1O (1 .d) the County is the authorizing entity for assignment of rural addressing in conformance with the modified Burkle addressing plan. When 911 addressing of a well site is not possible, the North Dakota 9—1—1 Association supports use of the NDIC code as the primary piece of information for locating a well site. <br/>If you have questions or concerns please don’t hesitate to contact my office and I will do whatever I can to assist your company. <br/>Sincerely, <br/>Katie Lima <br/>Building Official Development Services Building Division <br/>Development Services — Building Division PO Box 2047 | 220 2"d Ave. E. | Williston, ND 58802-2047 | Phone701.577.4567 l www.williamsnd.com </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Continental Resources, lnc. (CR1) respectfully submits the following information concerning the drilling ofthe Alfsvaag 2-31H, Alfsvaag 3-31H1, Bud 2-30H and Bud 3-30Hl, SWNW of Sec. 3] T153N-R99W, Williams Co., North Dakota. <br/>CR1 would like to propose the following safeguards and precautions to be taken while drilling the wells on the Alfsvaag-Bud 2,3 pad to prevent any contamination to freshwater sources during the drilling and completion of the wells: <br/>1. <br/>During construction of the location, the entire location will be constructed per NDIC permit stipulations, ensuring any spills or runoff which may occur on location do not penetrate the fresh ground water and are contained on the surface of the location. These modifications may include, but are not limited to, the inclusion of a liner being placed under the location, and cementing of the rathole and mousehole. <br/>Drainage will be re-routed to avoid the location, and erosion controls will be employed, as appropriate, around the site to reduce erosion and the resulting sediment contamination to freshwater runoff due to weather events. <br/>The earthen berm, constructed to keep any freshwater runoff off the location. will also eliminate any spills from leaving the location <br/>No reserve pit or dry cuttings pit will be utilized on location. <br/>The conductor will be drilled to a depth of 80', and 20" pipe will be run to depth and cemented to surface. <br/>During drilling operations, if necessary, a freshwater protection string of 1 3-3/ 8" 48# H40 casing will be set to a depth of 500' and cemented to surface to protect the shallow freshwater zones. Standard 9-5/8" 36# 1—55 surface casing will be set IOO' into the Pierre Shale, to a depth of 1940‘, and cemented to surface. <br/>Onsite, a Spill Prevention Containment and Countermeasure Plan will be made available for rig personnel so that they may prepare for any event which may occur during drilling or completions operations. A spill trailer will be located on location for spill response, if necessary. <br/>CRl believes adequate planning and precautions are being taken to prevent any contamination to ground water and surface waters. </p>

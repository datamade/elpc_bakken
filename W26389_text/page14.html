This pad was converted to a quad-well pad to include an additional TF well. Pad I includes the CCU Golden Creek 34—23MBH, CCU Golden Creek 24-23MBH, CCU Burner 21-26MBH, and CCU Burner 21-26TFH wells drilled in 2012. <br/>0 Pad J is a new dual-well pad proposed in the SE/4 of Section 34, T147N-R94W. The pad includes the CCU Bison Point 44-34MBH and CCU Bison Point 44-34TFH wells scheduled for drilling in 2013. <br/>0 Pad K is a new dual—well pad proposed in the SW/4 of Section 20, Tl47N-R95W. The pad includes the CCU William 14-20MBH and CCU William 14-20TFH wells scheduled for drilling in 2013. <br/>0 Pad L was initially a quad-well pad located in the NE/4 of Section 29, T147N-R95W. This pad <br/>was moved slightly to the southwest to minimize surface disturbance and includes additional TF wells. Pad L includes the CCU William 44—20TFH, CCU William 34-20MBH, CCU Powell 4129TFH, and CCU Powell 31-29MBH wells scheduled for drilling in 2013. <br/>o The location of the CCU Meriwether CTB #1 was initially in the SE/4 of Section 19, T147NR95W and was moved southeast to the NE/4 of Section 30, T147N—R95W closer to the existing <br/>lease road in an effort to minimize surface disturbance. Construction of the CTB was completed in 2012. <br/>0 The location of the CCU Powell CTB #2 was initially on the border of Sections 28 and 29, T147N-R95W and was moved west to the NW/4 of Section 29, T147N-R95W closer to the <br/>existing lease road in an effort to minimize surface disturbance and better serve the surrounding well pads. Construction of the CTB was initiated in 2012 and will be completed in 2013. <br/>o The location of the CCU Burner CTB #6 will remain in the SE/4 of Section 23, T147N-R95W. Construction of the CTB will be initiated and completed in 2013. <br/>Justiﬁcations for the new dual-well pad C and location change of pad H have previously been submitted to the NDIC for review and permit approval. Burlington will proceed with this modiﬁed Development <br/>Plan and will submit applications for permits on these wells accordingly. If you have any questions or need additional information regarding this matter, please contact me at your convenience. <br/>Sincerely, <br/>BURLINGTON RESOURCES OIL & GAS COMPANY LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips <br/>Mal/‘21 <br/>Darshan Naik, RPL Senior Landman <br/>Cc: Mr. Bruce Hicks — NDIC Assistant Director <br/>Page 3 of 6 Corral Creek — Bakken Unit 01-2013 <br/>  </p>

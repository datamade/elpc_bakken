Background gas increased only slightly to 600 total units through the upper member. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,970’ 1WD 10, 773’ T VD -8,587’ SS <br/>The black shale quickly cleared and samples of tan to light brown, oﬂen translucent dolomite reached surface. The clean dolomite was the lithology expected and represented the upper half of targeted middle Bakken member. Lowering deeper into zone, samples became slightly darker with increased amounts of clastic material. Samples of the target zone demonstrated good shows of petroleum in the form of dull but solid ﬂuorescence and instant, milky clouds drawn out by solvent <br/>After just eight hours of bit time, the end of the curve was reached on September <br/>10th 2014 at 6:30 am CT with a measured depth of 11,141 feet. Gamma markers throughout the Lodgepole repeatedly reinforced the once adjusted target of 10,788 feet and the end of curve had achieved a projected true vertical depth of 10,792 feet. <br/>Lateral Wellbore 11,141 ’— 20,372’ MD <br/>Intermediate 7 inch casing was cemented into the vertical and curve and drilling of the lateral began September 12‘”, 2014 at 9:30 am CT. The tool assembly exited casing low to the initial 8 foot target window which was projected at a nearly ﬂat 899° angle. As planned, the curve had been landed with an azimuth of 208° and required a 38° turn to achieve a due south heading and azimuth of 180°. While near continuous slide drilling was needed for direction, the wellbore was also adjusted for inclination and brought up into zone. <br/>A gray, sandy and silty dolomite conﬁrmed gamma data showing the wellbore was low within the middle Bakken. Structure data of the area had correctly suggested an up-dip trend over the course of the lateral. Following the completion of the directional turn at measured depth 12,500 feet, a new target angle of 90.25° was projected ﬁom measured depth 13,000 feet. Samples from the lower extent of zone were showing modest to weak signs of petroleum combined with low gas values averaging under 200 total units. <br/>As the lateral progressed, the assembly resisted efforts to increase in inclination and establish the wellbore up into the target zone. The bottom line of the target window was occasionally crossed as the wellbore tracked low to zone. No change in sample and gamma data through this interval veriﬁed the target interpretation. After becoming completely unresponsive to slide drilling, the assembly dropped in inclination rapidly. At measured depth 14,212 feet the bit struck the lower Bakken shale after surveying an inclination of 85°. At 7: 15 pm CT on September 13th, 2014 a trip to surface for a new set of tools began. <br/>Inspection of the ﬁrst assembly revealed the tools had shiﬁed 80° out of alignment, leading to the strike with the lower shale. On September 14‘“, 2014 at 9:20 am CT, time drilling for Sidetrack #1 began at measured depth 14,035 feet. By 4: 15 pm CT the same day, the alternate wellbore had been established and controlled rotary drilling resumed. <br/>The new wellbore was established within the target window which was still projected at 90.25°. The target position was veriﬁed with gamma data and changing lithology. Increasing <br/>5 </p>

Lagged samples represented a large bed of limestone, dolomjtic at the top, ranging in colors of tan, brown, light brown, gray to light gray, and cream. Limestone was crystalline to microcrystalline, argillaceous with little to no porosity, Fluorescence and cut were good and gas shows increased slightly from the previous formation with an average 200 total units and an occasional value over 300 total units of gas. </p>

Since the <br/>Lodgepole formation top came in close to where it was expected, the true vertical depth landing target was maintained at 10,791 feet. <br/>Lithology of the Lodgepole consisted of light brown to light gray brown, slightly argillaceous, lightly dolomitic limestone. Petroleum shows of the Lodgepole were scattered and <br/>generally weak. Some light oil staining, dull to pinpoint ﬂuorescence, and weak to instant cuts were observed. <br/>Curve 10,261’ —11,141’1WD <br/>Still within the Lodgepole formation on September 9th, 2014 at 8:20 am CT, with a measured depth of 10,261 feet, the kick off point was reached. After a trip to surface for curve building tools, drilling of the curve began later that night at 7:00 pm CT high within the Lodgepole Formation. While tripping to surface for tools, gamma and formation top data was reviewed and a minor 3’ raise to the landing target was made. The true vertical depth now <br/>targeted was 10,788 feet and represented an end of curve positioned 18 vertical feet into the middle Bakken. </p>

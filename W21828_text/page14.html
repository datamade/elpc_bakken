Flaring Alternatives: TUSA is currently evaluating the various process equipment which strips out NGL’s onsite. TUSA has contacted numerous vendors and is currently awaiting bids in order to evaluate the various different options. NGL skids are estimated to reduce VOC emissions by 63%, therefore with a 63% reduction in ﬂaring we’re looking at a reduction of about ~20%. <br/>Attachments: <br/>1. Signed Afﬁdavit <br/>2.

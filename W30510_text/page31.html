    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">South Lateral 11,320’ — 21,215 ' MD Day 1 11,295’ — 12,245’ MD <br/>Drilling resumed through the Middle Bakken formation at 7:00 pm. CST on March 3, 2015 with a 6” Security bit and a 15 degree Baker Hughes Mud Motor. The TIH began until tagging cement where the cement, Float & Shoe and ten feet of new formation were drilled to perform the FIT test. After ﬁnishing with the FIT test drilling resumed with the South lateral with casing exited at a lvﬂ) of 11,295’ at 7:00 pm. CST on March 3, 2015. Drilling began with the wellbore exiting casing at 90.34 degrees with the wellbore sitting about three feet above the top of the Middle Bakken target window. Slides were done throughout the night to work on the planned directional turn as well as to work keeping the wellbore pointed down to drop the wellbore into the target window. As the wellbore began to drop in section into the target window at around 87 degrees slides were done to slow the drop in TVD and the wellbore was leveled out about six feet <br/>below the base of the target window. Aﬁer seeing directional slides up the wellbore reached about two feet below the base of the target window and continued to track the lower warm gamma from the C to D faces transition. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 200 — 250 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 100 — 110 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 200 — 500 units with connection gases reaching as high as 870 units. The samples seen in the upper portion of the target exhibited a cream tan/cream gray tan dolomite with an even yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling continued with slides done for the planned directional turn which was completed aﬁer reaching an azimuth of 180 degrees. Slides were also done throughout the day to continue to work on bringing the wellbore up in TVD back into the lower portion of the Middle Bakken target window. Just as the wellbore would reach about one to two feet below the base of the target window it would take a a deﬂection and begin dropping in TVD again. Aﬁer seeing this directional worked on keeping the wellbore at or slightly above 91 degrees to break through the hard streak. Once through the hard streak the wellbore continued to track the lower portion of the target window. At around a MD of 13,767’ the wellbore began to climb in TVD rapidly and the formation began to down dip at 89.66 degrees. Slides were done as the wellbore exited the top of the target window and the transition from the C to A faces in gamma was seen. After seeing the slides the wellbore was rolled over and dropped back into the target window seeing the same repeat in gamma as before and began to drop through the target window with directional working on slowing the drop in TVD. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 250 — 280 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 80 — 100 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 400 — 600 units with connection gases reaching as high as 2,542 units. The samples seen throughout the upper portion of the Middle Bakken exhibited a light to medium tan/gray tan dolomite with an even to spotty yellow green ﬂuorescence with a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. </p>

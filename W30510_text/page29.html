Penetration rates throughout the majority of the Mission Canyon averaged around 70 - 80 ﬁ/hr with increases up to 100 ﬁ/hr seen throughout the different porosity benches. The samples throughout the upper 100' of the formation exhibited primarily a cream gray tan/gray tan limestone with moderate anhydrite present and occasional dolomite mixed in. The remainder of the formation exhibited primarily limestone with trace amounts of cream to off-white anhydrite present. Background gases averaged ar0und 80 — 100 units. The Mission Canyon formation was evaluated while drilling ahead. <br/>Lodgepole 1 0,1 63 ’ MD 1 0,143 ’ T VD -8, 000 ’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 10,163’, True vertical depth of 10,143’, four feet low to prognosis. The Lodgepole formation was picked at the base of the lower Mission Canyon porosity as well as a sample change from a cream gray tan limestone to a cream gray/light to medium gray limestone. Penetration rates throughout the formation down to KOP averaged around 80 — 100 ft/hr with background gases averaging around 50 - 60 units. KOP was reached at 7:35 pm.

CST on March 1, 2015. An 8 3/4” Security bit and 2.38 degree ﬁxed mud motor were used to build the curve. The landing target for the Cherry State #31-16HU at the beginning of the curve was set at 11,002’ @ 90 deg. based off the Lodgepole top and the ﬁrst two LP markers. The Cherry State #31-16-23H and Cherry State #31-16H were used for correlation purposes through the curve. Penetration rates at the beginning of the curve averaged around 80 - 100 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases through the Lodgepole formation averaged around 80 — 150 units. The lithology of the Lodgepole exhibited primarily a dark gray/light to medium gray limestone with occasional anhydrite present. Gamma markers began to show that the lower portion of the Lodgepole was slightly thicker than the offset wells. After seeing this, the TVD landing target was lowered to a TVD of 11,004’. The remainder of the Lodgepole formation was drilled out and the False Bakken was encountered. <br/>False Bakken 11,106' MD 1 0, 95 7’ TVD -8, 814 ’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 11,106’, true vertical depth of 10,957’, two feet low to prognosis.

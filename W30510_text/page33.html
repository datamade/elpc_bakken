Placing the wellbore about one foot below the top of the target window. Maintenance slides were done throughout the day to keep the wellbore around the current dip of 902 degrees to continue tracking the Middle Bakken target window. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 250 - 275 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 80 — 100 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 300 — 600 units with connection gases reaching as high as 2,138 units. The samples seen throughout the day continued to exhibit a cream tan/cream gray tan dolomite with traces of limestone and siltstone present and an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence with a slow streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling continued with the S lateral with the wellbore steadily tracking the Middle Bakken target interval. Aﬁer putting in a slide to drop the wellbore in TVD towards the lower half of the target window the wellbore began to slowly drop in TVD reaching the middle of the target window. The assembly continued to track the lower half of the target window throughout the rest of the all the way to TD of the South lateral. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 220 — 250 ft/hr while rotating and <br/>around 70 — 80 ft/hr while sliding Background gases averaged around 200 — 300 units while running through the gas buster with no ﬂare seen. <br/>Total depth of the South lateral was called at 21,215’ MD for the Cherry State #31-16HU with the wellbore ending in the lower portion of the Middle Bakken target window. The formation throughout the lateral had an overall estimated dip rate of 90.08 <br/>degrees. Total depth of the South Lateral was reached at 21,215’ MD at 5:35 pm. CDT on March 8, 2015 with 9,919’ of open horizontal hole drilled. </p>

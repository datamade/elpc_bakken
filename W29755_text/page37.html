Samples in the top portion of the Middle Bakken were predominantly a medium to dark gray limestone with fair porosity, good ﬂuorescence and oil shows. <br/>Drill rates in the Middle Bakken varied between 1.00 and 2.00 min/ﬂ. Total gas was in the 700-5000 unit range. <br/>Lateral 11,238’ — 15,426’ MD <br/>Aﬂer casing was set at MD 11,160', drilling resumed at 230 am CDT on February 7, 2015. A 10’ target zone was centered 25’ below the top of the Middle Bakken putting the “cool” gamma marker 2’ above the top of the zone. The lateral was projected on an eastbound direction (90.85 degrees) across section 36 in Township 151N/95W and offset 265' to the north. Formation dip was estimated at 89.5 degrees, dropping 43' of TVD across the entire 4,500' lateral. Actual formation dip was initially 89.3 degrees for the ﬁrst third of the lateral, then ﬂattening out to 89.7 degrees. </p>

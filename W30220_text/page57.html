The Eckert Foundation 152-102-2215—1H well was spudded on January 15, 2015 with surface drilled and cased to be resumed at a later date. Patterson 320 spudded the Eckert Foundation 152-102-22-15—1H well on February 14, 2015 and reached a total depth of 20,712’ MD on April 1, 2015. Wellsite geological services began at 9,000 on February 17, 2014 at 2:04 AM MST. The initial phase of the Eckert Foundation 152- 102-22-15— 1H is a vertical and curve landing in the Middle Bakken Formation on February 20, 2014. The single lateral well targeting the Middle Bakken Formation approximately 14’—24’ below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale was started on March 26, 2014. Thirty-foot samples were collected throughout the vertical and curve with ﬁfty foot samples collected in the lateral. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 9, 000’ — 10,444 ’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 9,000’ MD in the Charles/Madison formation on February 17, 2015 at 2:05 AM MST. Gas detection system was tested before logging depth with system ﬁinctioning correctly. Drill rates before encountering the Base Last Salt ranged from 02—427 minutes per foot and averaging 0.63 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 56-146 units averaging 87 units. A typical sample was: LIMESTONE: Light gray, gray, dark gray, brown, tan, cream, crypto—crystalline, argillaceous, carbonaceous, moderate to well induration, dolomitic, poor inter-granular porosity, 15 % anhydrite, even yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming milky cut. <br/>Base ofLast Salt 9,3 76 ’ MD 9,358 ’ TVD -7, 066 ’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was picked 1 foot lower than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and differential pressure. Drill rates below the Base of the Last Salt ranged from 0.35—2.85 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 0.61 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 67-146 units averaging 106 units. A typical sample was: LIMESTONE: Gray, light gray, white, cream, tan, brown, crypto— crystalline, argillaceous, dolomitic, fair induration, poor to no inter-granular porosity, anhydrite, trace deadl—dry oil stain, even yellow-green ﬂorescence, slow milky cut. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,591 ’ MD 9,5 72’ T VD -7,280’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon formation was picked 1 foot lower than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and differential pressure. Drill rates in the Mission Canyon formation ranged from 0.08—2.85 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 0.67 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 73-191 units averaging 126 units.

Gas ranged from 17 — 4,097 units with an average of 1874 units throughout the lateral. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The Eckert Foundation 152-102-22-1 5-1H Lateral reached a total depth of 20,712’ MD on April 1, 2014 at 12:15 PM MST. The Gamma ranged from 45 - 101 API with average of 79 API. Gas averaged 1874 units throughout the lateral, The lateral section was drilled 100% in the Middle Bakken formation with poor to moderate intergranular porosity seen throughout the lateral, light to fair brown oil staining in samples, and weak to fair milky cuts and even dull to bright yellow green ﬂuorescence. The indications of good gases, and fair oil shows in the lithology while drilling indicate this well will be a good oil producer. The Eckert Foundation 152-102-22-15—1H will be awaiting completion to go online producing oil, <br/>Robert Kappel & Jesse F reborg Wellsite Geologists </p>

It is located in Section 25 T159N R94W, Burke County, North Dakota. <br/>The well spudded on October 10, 2014. Wellsite geological services consisted of a two person mudlogging unit from 7,600 feet in the Charles Salt through the end of the well. A Total Gas detector was used for gas detection. Two sets of lagged samples in thirty foot intervals were caught and saved to be archived, with one set for Petro—Hunt and the other set for the State of North Dakota. <br/>Vertical Hole 7, 600 ' —9, 000 ' MD <br/>Wellsite geological services began at 7,600 feet measured depth at the base of the Charles Salt formation. Logging services started on October 19, 2014. The well had 9 5/8” surface casing set at 1,994’ MD. Formation tops were initially picked oﬂ‘ samples and rate of penetration and samples until gamma tools were picked up. <br/>Note: All ﬂuorescence and cuts were contaminated with oil based mud. Charles Salt 7,274 ’ MD 7,274 ’ TVD ~5, 052’ SS <br/>Logging began within the Charles Salt, so the depths listed above are based on the prognosis. Samples taken from the portion of the formation that were drilled were largely composed of light to cream gray, soﬁ limestone with small amounts of off white, soft anhydrite. A bed of salt nearly 100 feet in thickness was seen at the formation’s base. Drill rates were 1.0— 1.5 minutes/foot while in the limestone and 0.5 minutes/foot while in the salt. Gas levels held near 100 units. <br/>Base of Last Salt 7,880’ MD 7,818 ’ TVD —5,596’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt came in 12 feet low to prognosis and began with an approximately 75 foot thick layer that was a mix of soft white anhydrite and soft light gray limestone. Drill rates in this portion of the BLS were between 1.0 and 2.0 minutes/foot. Gas levels averaged 100-120 background units. This gave way to light to cream gray limestone that was well to moderately indurated and drilled at approximately 1.0 minute/foot. Gas in the lower part of the formation increased, reaching 200+ background units with a connection peaking at 348 units. <br/>Mission Canyon 8,086 ’ MD 8,022 ’ TVD -5,800’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon consisted of gray to light or cream gray limestone that was well indurated and argillaceous. Visible porosity was typically poor although there could be spotty </p>

Gamma rose sharply at 177 50’ MD reaching 150-160 api. It was initially thought that this was the lower marker but by 17 840’ MD gamma had climbed to 400+ api, indicating that the wellbore had encountered the overlying Pronghorn shale. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">However, samples did not show any Pronghorn or Lower Bakken shale and drilling parameters did not indicate that the bit was drilling through shale. As a result, the decision was made to pull back 10 stands and re—log sections of gamma to verify that the gamma probe was working correctly. Re—logging the ﬁrst stands conﬁrmed initial gamma readings. However, relogged gamma past 17750’ MD remained around 100 api rather than climbing to 400+. This was <br/>likely a result of a temporary glitch in the gamma probe that was reset when the stands were pulled back. <br/>Since gamma appeared to indicate that the wellbore was still within the general target window but had room to come down, a new target projection was drawn up. The target window was shifted up 2’ TVD to make the last survey the new target window with the target inclination going at 89.1 degrees from there. <br/>The gamma probe began malfunctioning again at 17913’ MD, so the decision was made to trip out and replace it. Shortly after drilling resumed it was decided that an 89.1 degree inclination was not necessary as the wellbore was over 20 feet beneath the Pronghorn shale and the gamma probe was once again working reliably. As a result, target inclination was changed to match the rough formation dip calculation of 89.6 degrees. <br/>Samples in this late stage of the lateral were mostly dolomite with small amounts of shale, even yellow ﬂuorescence, and occasionally thin streaming cuts. Gas was 300-500 background units, though could reach as high as 1000 on occasion. ROP was typically near 100 ﬁ/hr while rotating. <br/>Drilling continued in the same manner as just described until a TD of 19179’ MD at 1:54 AM on 11/5/14 in the Three Forks. <br/>Conclusion </p>

Although cuts were often slow and thin, samples consistently showed good porosity. That, in addition to the fact that one trip had gas reach 9270 units will make it interesting to see how this well performs when <br/>produced, <br/>Jesse Sparrow Wellsite Mudlogger </p>

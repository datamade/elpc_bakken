    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The kick-off point for the curve was reached at 10,708’ MD at 2:1 1 pm CST on December 21, 2014. Drilling ofthe curve began at 4:52 pm CST on December 23, 2014. <br/>Based on TVD correlations to the adjacent 8-30Hl Three Forks well and the offset Seaton 14—30 well, the target land point was set at 11,162” TVD. The curve was landed at 11,522’ MD, at 2:05 am CST on December 25‘“, 2014. The landing TVD was 11,163.52’ at an <br/>inclination of 89.47 degrees, as projected to the bit. False Bakken 11,085 ’ MD 11,035 ’ T V1) -8, 726’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was marked at 1 1,085’ MD and 11,035’ TVD using gamma ray data. The lithology was expected to contain a stringer of argillaceous shale but was not seen in the <br/>lagged sample. Upper Bakken Shale II, 104 ’ MD 11,048 ’ TVD -8, 739 ’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was encountered at a TVD of 1 1,048’ which was marked 7’ TVD above prognosis based on the adjacent Rennerfeldt 8-30H1 well. The average ROP was 1.18 minutes per foot, and gas detection was poor due to issues with low ﬂow at the agitator, with average readings of 49 and a maximum of 104 units. A typical sample was black to very dark brown, gritty, carbonaceous, ﬁssile shale with a disseminated pyrite. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,139’ MD 11,068’ TVD -8, 759 ’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Middle Bakken was encountered at a TVD of 1 1,068’ which was 7’ higher than prognosis based on the adjacent Rennerfeldt wells. The average ROP was 1.38 minutes per foot, and gas averaged 49 units overall, with a peak of 104 units as drilling ﬂuid ﬂow restriction issues continued. A typical sample was medium gray to gray brown and ﬁne to very ﬁne-grained, slightly argillaceous well sorted siltstone, with subangular to subround sand and calcareous cement. Porosity was fair and oil shows were questionable due to petroleum based drilling ﬂuid. <br/>Lower Bakken Shale 11,224’ MD 11,112' TVD -8,803'SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale was encountered at a TVD 1 1,1 12’ and a MD of 11,124’ based on gamma changes, lithology, and drilling parameters. The ROP was approximately 1.56 minutes per foot, with an average of 135 units and a maximum of 361 units of gas recorded. The sample consisted of shale, which was black and very dark gray, ﬁrm, moderately compacted, blocky to platy, abundantly carbonaceous, and calcareous, with disseminated pyrite. Oil shows <br/>were patchy dull yellow green ﬂuorescence, instant milky cut and inﬂuenced by petroleum based drilling ﬂuid. </p>

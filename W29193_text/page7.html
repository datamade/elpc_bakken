    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">gamma data led to a formation projection at an 89.4 degree down-dip between 18,000’ and 19,000’ MD which steepened into a dip of 89.1 at 19,500’ MD. On January 9, 2015, while drilling ahead in the sidetrack well, the decision was made to raise the ideal target 5’ in TVD. This decision moved the wellbore out of target for portions of the lateral section but ensured high well control until the well reached its total depth. <br/>As the wellbore progressed down in the steepest down-dipping segment of the lateral section, the clean gamma marker was again entered, however, the fomiation ﬂattened unexpectedly and the wellbore entered the Internal 1 Shale, just below the target zone, and bottomed out roughly 4.5’ TVD out of zone. Again the directional team encountered difﬁculty bringing the wellbore back into ideal formation target depth, but ultimately were able steer the wellbore back into the cool gamma zone, which allowed for a dip calculation and the formation projection was ﬂattened to 89.9. For the final 1,000’ to total depth, the wellbore intersected the entire target zone. Projected to bit, the wellbore terminated above the zone, approximately 1.5” TVD. <br/>Throughout the lateral section, samples were moderately to heavily dolomitic Siltstone, generally light to medium gray brown, tan gray, and cream gray, very ﬁne to ﬁne grained, moderately indurated, with traces of very ﬁne to ﬁne sand, poor to fair intergranular porosity, slightly to moderately argillaceous, calcareous cementation, and microsucrosic. Samples contained varying amounts of ﬁne Shale laminations that were all colors of gray to blue gray. Oil shows were generally even ﬂuorescence, bright to dull yellow to yellow green, with thin to thick broad streaming into fast to instant cloudy cuts. During drilling the lateral section, the rate of penetration averaged 0.60 minutes per foot (100 feet per hour) and gaseous hydrocarbons averaged 196 units with spikes in the 500-600 range. Trip gas consistently reached maximum saturation of Gas readings were generally lower than expected in portions of the lateral due to ﬂow impediment to the gas detection system, which was rectiﬁed during drilling operations. <br/>Conclusion </p>

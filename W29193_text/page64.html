    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Rennerfeldt 6-30H1 is a Three Forks well targeting the low gamma ray, high porosity zone above the Internal 1 Shale and is located on Section 19 T155N R98W in Williams County, North Dakota. The initial phase is a vertical and curve, landing 21.5 feet within the Three Forks Formation. The Rennerfeldt 6-301-11 spudded on December 16, 2014 and reached a total depth of21,690’ MD on January 11, 2015. The Bottom Hole Location is 239.39' FSL & 1,461 .79‘ FEL in Section 31 T155N R98W, Williams County, North Dakota. <br/>Wellsite geological services began at 9,400’ in the Charles Formation, just above the Base of the Last Charles Salt at 2:36 pm am CST on December 20, 2014. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected during the straight hole and curve while one hundred foot lagged samples were caught during the lateral. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey depository in Grand Forks, ND. <br/>Vertical 9,400 ’ — 10, 708 ’ MD <br/>Logging services began at 9,400’ near the base of the Charles Formation on December 20, 2014 at 2:36 pm CST. Drill rates averaged 0.94 minutes per foot throughout the vertical section, with the gas averaging 43 units, with the highest spikes coming from the Lodgepole at <br/>237 units. Base ofthe Last Salt 9,507’MD 9,506’ TVD -7,I98’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered at 9,506’ TVD and -7,198’ SS, with no change ﬁ'om prognosis based upon the adjacent Rennerfeldt 8-30H1 well. The Base of the Last Salt was picked by the last sample with salt present, and ROP change, and gamma data. Typical samples were mottled, banded, and grainy, medium to dark gray and gray brown argillaceous Limestone with up to forty percent Anhydrite. Fluorescence was generally even and pale yellow. Cuts were questionable due to petroleum based drilling ﬂuid. </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The top ofthe Mission Canyon was picked at 9,720’ MD and 9,719’ TVD, with no difference from the prognosis depth. The pick was based off of the gamma marker and lithology change, along with drilling breaks. Drill rates in the Mission Canyon averaged 0.96 minutes per foot with gas up to 104 units and an average of 39 units. Typical samples were medium gray to dark gray limestone, wackestone to packstone, moderately argillaceous, poorly to moderately indurated, poor intergranular porosity. Cuts and ﬂuorescence shows were sporadic and questionable due to the oil-based mud. <br/>Lodgepole 10,346’MD 10,345’ TVD -8,036’ SS <br/>The top of the Lodgepole was picked at 10,345’ TVD, which was 3’ below prognosis. The pick was based off of the gamma marker and sample change, along with drilling breaks and a change in differential pressure. Drill rates in the Lodgepole average 1.68 minutes per foot with gas averaging 43 units with a maximum of237 units. Typical samples were medium to dark gray </p>

Violation or default of any terms of this easement by GRANTEE shall be grounds for termination of this easement. GRANTOR shall give GRANTEE written notice of violation or default and GRANTEE shall have 30 days after receipt of said notice to rectify such violations or defaults. In the event GRANTEE fails to comply, GRANTOR may terminate this easement. <br/>7. If construction of the well site is not completed within one year after GRANTOR signs this easement, this easement automatically terminates. <br/>8. GRANTEE, or its agent, shall have a legible copy of this easement with them on site for reference during construction, operation, maintenance or reclamation and shall present the copy upon GRANTOR's request. <br/>9. GRANTEE shall make a satisfactory settlement with the surface tenant for damage to seeded annual crops, fences or other improvements owned by the tenant, caused by construction, operation, maintenance or removal of the well site and shall notify the surface tenant of the construction schedule at least one week before <br/>construction. 10. GRANTEE shall maintain the natural water ﬂow and drainage. <br/>11. If, prior to or during construction, archeological or paleontological items are discovered or such items are disturbed, GRANTEE shall cease construction activities immediately. GRANTEE shall then promptly notify GRANTOR and must not resume construction until written approval is given by GRANTOR. <br/>12. Any ﬁxtures, structures, installations or facilities constructed or installed by GRANTEE, are the property of GRANTEE and may be removed by GRANTEE at any time. <br/>13. GRANTEE shall remove all improvements, both above ground and underground, from the easement area when the easement is abandoned or in any other way terminated, unless authorized to do otherwise in writing by <br/>GRANTOR. <br/>14. GRANTEE shall, prior to construction, maintenance or removal, reserve the top 8 inches of soil from areas subject to topsoil and subsoil mixing. The reserved soil must be stockpiled to minimize wind and water erosion. Upon completion of construction, and maintenance or removal, GRANTEE shall promptly reclaim the disturbed area. It must be recontoured to conform to the adjacent natural topography, rocks exposed by excavation must be hauled off or reburied on the property, the reserved soil must be evenly respread over the disturbed area, and the entire disturbed area must be revegetated with a mixture of native perennial grasses as shown in Exhibit "C". Reclamation is not complete until rocks are removed from the surface, erosion is controlled and the <br/>surface is revegetated with a mixture of native perennial grasses. <br/>15. After construction is complete, topsoil shall be evenly respread on all areas from which it was removed, except those areas covered by construction aggregate or any other surfacing material. The topsoil from those areas covered by construction aggregate or other surfacing material shall remain stockpiled for use during the reclamation of the well site. All exposed soil surfaces not covered by construction aggregate or other surfacing materials shall be revegetated with a mixture of native perennial grasses, as shown in Exhibit "C", sufﬁcient to <br/>prevent accelerated erosion and restore, as closely as possible, the original long-term productivity. <br/>16. GRANTEE shall take necessary precautions to prevent ﬁres. In the event of a ﬁre caused by the GRANTEE or its agent, GRANTEE shall compensate the GRANTOR's surface lessee(s) for their losses including forage, crop and any other losses; and shall compensate GRANTOR for any loss it suffers due to the ﬁre. <br/>17. GRANTEE shall conduct all activities associated with the well site in a manner that avoids the degradation of the area's air, land, water quality, and visual resources. <br/>18. Weather permitting, within 180 days of abandonment of the well site, GRANTEE shall dispose of all surface contaminated soil. remove debris, recontour the disturbed surface to conform with the original terrain. bury all <br/>A-” </p>

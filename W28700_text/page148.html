Goodsen wells). Spud in 1981. 9-5/8” set at 2020'. 8-3/ ” hole drilled to Red River at 13,567’. 7” casing run to 13,550' and cemented with stage tool. Did not get cement over Dakota. Well plugged in 1982. Given to landowner to make fresh water well. Vertical well. <br/>Davis Choctaw Cross 24-32: Sec 32—T149N-R102W (in SW/4 of same section as J. Goodsen wells). Spud in 2001. 9-5/8" set at 2257'. Drilled 8-3/4" hole with invert mud. Twice stuck in salt—Charles at 8626' and Prairie at 11,788’. TD’d at 13,560” in Red River and ran 5-1/2” casing to 13,555’. In 2014, producing 18 BOPD and 15 mcfpd. Vertical well <br/>Hot Rod 1-27-26H: Sec 27-T149N-R102W. Lateral drills East. Drilling unit includes Sec. 27 and 26. 9—5/8” set at 2131’. 7” casing set at 11,168’. 4-1/2” liner set from 10,311' to 20,784'. Lateral drilled with only one trip at 16,087’MD for MWD, motor, and bit. Lube sweeps started at 13,500' MD. <br/>Excalibur 5-25-36H: Sec 25 T149N R102W (285’ FRNL & 2400’ FWL) First well on pad--Spud 6/26/2013. 9-5/8” set at 2142’. Ran gyro in surface hole—prior to running casing. Drilled 8-3/4" hole to 11,300’. Had to back ream and W&R salts on trips (8732'-9086’). Ran logs at KOP—10,392'. Ran 7” casing to 11,291'. During cement job for 7” casing, the annulus packed off when ‘7. of displacement was pumped. Had to let pressure bleed down and slowly pump. Eventually pumped calculated volume of displacement. When drilled out with 6" bit—cement was found at ~419’ above float collar (10,872"). (Had not finished drilling lateral at time of writing.) <br/>Okland #2 SWD Sec 36 T149N R102W (600' FSL and 2040’ FEL):Completed in 1981 as vertical well. 9-5/8” at 3025’ and 5-1/2" at 11,109’. Dakota Salt Water disposal well with perfs at 5680'-5720’. Cumulative SW disposed = 879,710 bbls. Injection pressure 500 psi. Not active since 1992. The Excalibur 5-25-36H approached it at approximately TD. It is a “blind vertical” well since it does not have directional surveys. Excalibur 5 lateral <br/>terminated early at 1100' FSL to maintain 500’ minimum from the surface location—Le. 600’ + 500' = 1100’ FSL. As Excalibur 4 approaches SWD offset in lateral at +I-600’ FSLI slow ROP and monitor: magnetic <br/>interference, shock and vibration, torque and drag, changes in drilling fluid volumes, and appearance of metal shavings in drill cuttings. <br/>Slugger 1-16-21H Sec 16 T149N R102W (On same pad as Talon) </p>

    <p class="styleSans10.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Spud in April 2013. On same pad as the Talon 1-9-4H ~50' away. 9-5/8” set at 2052‘. Cmt’d with 684 sx and 100 bbls to surface. Drilled 8—3/4” hole. Slides needed 2683’-2904’ for azimuth. Salts sticky and needed reaming on trips. Charles Salt-BLS (8645’-9303’). Ran Schl. Open-hole logs at KOP=10,270‘. Drilled curve to 11,210 and ran 7" csg. Circ out gas after casing on btm. Cement volumes TOC calc= 2050’. Lost full returns after pumping only 1/3 of displacement and did not get it back. Lift pressure continued rising (1900 psi max) on cementer's job report—calculated that cement was raised to at least 7500’+. Floats did not hold. After drilling out with 6” bit. CBL run at 12,634’ MD. <br/>Sanders SWD #1 Sec 4 T149N R102W: (For Talon) <br/>An old Salt Water Disposal well, Sanders SWD #1, is located at 1980’ FSL & 662’ FWL Section 4. Spud 1979. 95/8” casing set at 4491’. It was drilled to 13,600’ and 7” casing set. The Talon 1-09-4H will approach it at approximately 17,500’+ MD. It is a "blind vertical” well since it does not have directional surveys. Talon planned to stay inside the 1200' FWL setback to maintain 500’ minimum from the surface location—Le. 662' + 500’ = 1162’ FWL. As approach SWD offset, Talon slowed ROP and monitored: magnetic interference, shock and vibration, torque and drag, changes in drilling fluid volumes, and appearance of metal shavings in drill cuttings. <br/>Caper 1-15-22H: Sec 15 T149N R102W <br/>Spud in Feb 2013. Spudder rig settled while drilling due to cellar giving way. Preset 9-5/8" at 2089’. Good cement returns—120 bbls to surface. Drilled vertical hole from 2089'-10,330’ KOP. At 6000’-7300’ had to slide/correct for Azimuth. Charles salt sticky while drilling. Ran logs at KOP. Tight hole due to salts on TlH after logging—7414, 8613’, 8801’. Drilled curve with Smith F30 and Hunting motor with 2.49 deg Fixed Bent Housing. Ran 7" casing to <br/>Page 20 of 25 </p>

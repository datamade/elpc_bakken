    <p class="styleSans18.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">  <br/>RPM <br/>Dudley Dawson 6-2-11H w W ‘1 <br/>21. Set liner hanger in vertical section of hole at least 75-ft above KOP (between 7” casing collars) and <br/>release setting tool per guidelines provided by Service Company. After setting hanger, perform a push/pull test and pressure test to 3,000 psi holding for 15 minutes—OR test per service company guidelines. <br/>22. If liner hanger tests successfully, lay down drill pipe. lf liner hanger does not test, run in hole with second packer and sting into polished bore receptacle and set. If second test is not successful, a retrievable bridge plug will need to be set above KOP. <br/>23. Run a cement bond log utilizing the drilling rig while cleaning out mud tanks, etc. Approximate time to rig up and run a CBL is 5 hours. Run wireline tools into PBR in order to confirm liner hanger is not set over a collar. Log from PBR up to ZOO-ft above cement top. <br/>24. lF OH logs were NOT run --run “Gamma Ray” on CBL tool all the way to surface. <br/>25. Send digital copy of log to and other personnel receiving daily reports. Include NDIC on distribution of OH and CH logs. <br/>26. Set off BOPE. Nipple up and test 11" 5M x 7-1/16” 5M” tubing head with profile to land frac string with hanger. NU BOP for running frac string. <br/>Frac String Not Planned at this Time---Frac String Running Procedure <br/>1. Fill one tank with 300 bbls completion fluid (clean salt water mixed with packer fluid and scale inhibitor) for spotting packer fluid. Will need another tank to circulate out drilling ﬂuid. Closed loop mud system, so no pit. <br/>2. MI, unload, & tally new 10 408-ft threads 0 of 4 1/2” 13.5# P-110 BT&C casin . Have full set of pup joints available for landing which will include the following: (2) 10-ft, (2) 8-ft, (1) 6-ft, (1) 4-ft, (1) 2-ft for Range 3 casing. <br/>3. Set pipe racks and move casing onto location. Move in and clean/inspect threads before picking up pipe. <br/>4. Coordinate with wellhead company on 4 1/2” hanger threads — BTC or LTC. Would prefer to have hanger with BTC threads on both the upper and lower threads. If not, have the proper crossovers and note grade of any crossovers. <br/>5. Because the wellhead is all 5M, the hanger needs to have an extended neck to completely isolate the 5M equipment. <br/>6. Notify Weatherford of BTC threads and they will have BTC box available on seal assembly. Confirm threads when equipment arrives on location. <br/>7. MIRU Weatherford casing crew and equipment to pick up frac string. <br/>8. Have a crate or large bags to put thread protectors into while running frac string. The thread protectors need to stay on location. Best to put them by the treater house so they do not get lost in the snow. <br/>9. Caliper and record length of seal assembly. Ensure length of seal assembly is correct for 20-ft PBR. Inspect seals and note the GO/NOGO collar above seal assembly. <br/>10. PU & RlH with Weatherford 20’ floating seal assembly and go/no go on bottom of 4 1/z" casing. Also note bottom of seal assembly — mule shoe or rounded. <br/>11. Make up seal assembly on 4 1/2" frac string and begin running in hole. <br/>12. Tag PBR and rotate 1/4 turn if needed to drop in. Move up 4’ depending on spacing out the pipe at the rig floor. <br/>13. Circulate completion fluid all the way around so the annular and frac string have clean salt water. <br/>14. Pump 100 gallons of diesel down the backside for frost cushion on top of packer ﬂuid. <br/>15. Tag hanger and space out to land casing with 40,000# of slack off (verify with prior to landing) to account for tubing movement. Have pups made up and on location. <br/>16. Run subs below full joint of 4 1/2" casing. <br/>17. Land frac string with hanger in tubing head. <br/>18. ND BOP. </p>

In the event that electric power is required on-site, a natural gas powered generator will be evaluated. Installation of a liquid stripping plant to be utilized in the event of upset conditions would not be economics Such an installation will be re—evaluated as additional wells are completed and if conditions change. <br/>A natural gas powered generator could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 30-40 MCFD. A liquid stripping plant could be expected to reduce flare volumes by approximately 40% On lease gas use by Heater/Treaters will consume approximately 15 MCFD </p>

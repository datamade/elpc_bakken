Gas Gathering Pipeline System (See attached pipeline system map) which includes: <br/>a. Name and location of the destination processing plant: Nextera Energy Inc.. Mobile Recovery Unit (MRU) SW/4 of Section lS-Tl63N—R101W. Divide County. ND b. Name of gas gatherer and location of lines for each gatherer in the map vicinity: <br/>Nextera Energy Inc. Location of lines is shown on attached map. <br/>c. Proposed route and tie-in point to connect the subject well to an existing gas line: <br/>Well gas line will go north and tie-in to Nextera Energy Inc.. Haugen gas line at the NW comer of Section 4-Tl63N-R101W, Divide County. ND. within 30 to 60 days of completion. All gas is sold to and becomes the property of Nextera Energy Inc. when it passes through the sales meter at the edge ofthc production pad. <br/>3. Information On Existing Line T0 Which Subject Well Will Connect a. Maximum current daily capacity of the existing gas line: 7.5 MMCFPD b. Current throughput of the existing gas line: less than 3.75 MMCFPD c. Anticipated daily capacity of existing gas line at date ofﬁrst gas sales: 7.5 MMCFPD d. Anticipated throughput of existing gas line at date of ﬁrst gas sales: less than 3.75 MMCFPD e. Gas gatherer issues or expansion plans for the area if known: Expansion plans for 2014 shown in RED on attached map. <br/>4. Flowback Strategy 3. Anticipated date of ﬁrst production: October 12. 2014 b. Anticipated oil and gas rates and duration. (Total for all wells ifmulti-well pad.) Initial rate for up to 30 days — up to 200 BOPD and 200 MCFPD Rate from 30 to 90 days — up to 120 BOPD and 120 MCFPD Rate thereafter - from 20 to 120 BOPD and 20 to 120 MCFPD The other well scheduled for this pad is the Byron 4-4—163-101. It is scheduled to be spud August 10. 2014. with the completion scheduled to start September 1 1. 2014. and ﬁrst production to start September 21 . 2014. These two wells combined could produce up to 400 MC FPD for the ﬁrst 30 days. up to 240 MCFPD from 30 to 90 days and no more than 240 MCF PD thereaﬁer. These ﬂow rates are well below the 7.5 MMCF PD rated capacity of the existing gas line. <br/>5. Amount of Gas Applicant is Currently Flaring <br/>a. Statewide percentage of gas American Eagle Energy Corporation ﬂares producing from Bakken petroleum system: 9% <br/>b. Percentage of gas American Eagle Energy Corporation ﬂares in C olgan Field: 7% <br/>6. Alternatives To F laring <br/>a. Produced gas from this well will be used as lease fuel to ﬁre a heater-Heater to heat the produced ﬂuid and facilitate separation of the oil. water and gas. In addition. produced gas will be used to provide fuel for a natural gas engine which will power a well pumping unit. An alternate system available to reduce the amount of gas that is ﬂared is a turboexpansion NGL recovery unit. <br/>b. Using produced gas to ﬁre a heateHreater and provide fuel for a natural gas engine which will power a well pumping unit consumes up to 56% of the gas produced. A turboexpansion NGL recovery unit would reduce the remaining gas to be ﬂared (after that used for lease fuel and that sold to Nextera Energy “Inc.) by approximately 15%. <br/>(U <br/>  </p>

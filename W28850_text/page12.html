SUITE 202 LITTLETON, CO 80120 <br/>RE: SHELLEY LYNN 4-4N-163-101 LOT4 4-163N-101W DIVIDE COUNTY WELL FILE NO. 28850 <br/>Dear Richard: <br/>After review of the Cement Bond Log submitted on the above referenced well, dated October 17, 2014, we have determined that the top of cement behind the 7" casing string is at a depth of 4542 feet. The top of the CRETACEOUS-INYAN KARA Formation within the Dakota Group is picked from logs at 4026 feet. The North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-21 requires that sufﬁcient cement be used to isolate the Dakota Group of which the CRETACEOUS-INYAN KARA Formation is a part. In lieu of an immediate cement squeeze, approval may be granted (via Form 4 Sundry Notice) to monitor the surfaceproduction casing annulus. Approval will be contingent upon the following stipulations: <br/>1. The surface-production casing annulus must be continuously monitored with an accurate pressure gauge, the pressure gauge must not be any higher than a 300 psi gauge. <br/>2. All valves installed on the annulus must be exposed to the surface; burial will be allowed only in the presence of an Oil and Gas Division inspector. <br/>3. Any pressure development on the annulus must be immediately reported to the Oil and Gas Division 4. The CRETACEOUS-INY AN KARA Formation must be isolated, as directed by the Oil and Gas <br/>Division, upon the abandonment of the well, remedial action may be required prior to abandonment if warranted by the Director. <br/>Since the Dakota Group is not properly isolated, AMERICAN EAGLE must run a frac string prior to performing a Hydraulic Fracture Simulation per North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02- <br/>03-27.] <br/>If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me. <br/>Sincere y, Richard A. uggs <br/>  <br/>Geologist mlb/ras <br/>600 E Boulevard Ave - Dept 405, Bismarck, North Dakota 58505-0840 Phone (701)328-8020 Fax (701)328—8022 </p>

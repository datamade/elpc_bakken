Pilot program was not able to produce consistent results to move forward with field implementation at this time. Natural gas generators will continue to be evaluated as an alternative In the future. <br/>Bi-Fuel (Blended) Diesel Generators: 0 Bi-Fuel diesel generators are diesel generators with natural gas "makeup" kit (blend kit) allowing units to use produced gas onsite to power the facility. a Hess is currently in the conceptual phase of evaluation of Bl-Fuel Diesel Generators. <br/>Fleet Vehicles Bi-Fuel Conversions: - Similar to the bi-fuel conversion on rigs, individual vehicles can be converted to operate on either </p>

The company is looking at the possibility of using compressed natural gas from TGP to fuel vehicles. Currently, one refueling location has been scoped. <br/>Because there is only one refueling location for compressed natural gas, it would be difficult to make this project economically viable. Cost savings come from using compressed gas, rather than diesel fuel or gasoline. <br/>individual production facilities are not being considered for use as compressed natural gas stations at this time. <br/>Hess will continue to evaluate this technology. </p>

The Lodgepole was determined off of the pre-detennined Lodgepole gamma marker and subtle color change in samples. Three Lodgepole markers were recorded before reaching kick off point at 10,070' MD. KOP was reached at 4:22am on October 25, 2014. The rig then pulled out of the hole to pick up the build curve assembly. <br/>Build Curve <br/>The EN-VP&R-154-94-2536H-4 build curve began on October 25, 2014 at a measured depth of 10,070' in the mid portion of the Lodgepole formation and was drilled with an average drill rate of 50-70 ft/hr while sliding and rotating. The Lodgepole consisted of soft to ﬁrm limestone, that is also light gray, gray, and light gray brown in color. Landing estimations ﬂuctuated as high as 10,655' TVD and as low as 10,678' TVD throughout the Lodgepole formation with the original projected TVD set at 10,650‘ TVD. The ideal landing was set at 10,663 ’ TVD once recording the top of the Middle Bakken formation at 10,642’ TVD. <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale formation was encountered at the base of the Lodgepole formation at a MD of 10,810‘ and a TVD of 10,616‘. The lithology of shale was black in color and very carbonaceous with fair yellow oil shows. The top of the Bakken shale was 11' low from projection which projected the estimated landing to 10,668' TVD. The shale was entered at approximately 72 degrees and exited at approximately 75 degrees. After 92' MD and 26' TVD the base of the Bakken Shale was reached and the top of the Middle Bakken was encountered at a MD of 10,902' and TVD of 10,642‘, projecting landing at 10,663' TVD. Lithology moved from carbonaceous shale to light brown to brown to light brown gray sandstone. Shows maintained fair quality with yellow cuts. Drill rates decreased slightly and averaged 50-60 ft/hr while rotating and sliding. <br/>The EN-VP&R-154-94-2536H-4 build curve was landed at 1 1,085' MD and 10,664.13’ TVD on October 27, 2014 at 1:43 a.m. CST. The rig proceeded to ream the curve wellbore and trip out to lay down build curve tools before picking up 7" casing. </p>

Initial targets were set at 90.0 degrees based off the EN-VP&R-lS4-94-2536l—I-2 Middle Bakken lateral. The center target line was set 8’ below landing location. Targets were mildly adjusted 800’ later: target adjustment #2 raised the target line 5’ in zone and decreased target inclination to 89.7 degrees to match with expected dip. The directional team drilled along these targets, dipping 34’ below the target line before starting the 23 degree azimuth turn at 12,235’ MD to move due south from 157 degrees to 180 degrees. Thirty foot surveys were taken through the duration of the tum, as required by North Dakota state requirements. The ideal geological window targeted a drilling line 25' into the Middle Bakken formation with a hard line set at 40'. After drilling along the bottom half of the ideal geological window for over 800’ gamma correlations became very ambiguous as the gamma signature below the target line is very hard to differentiate. Target adjustment #3 raised the target line 9’ in zone and resumed a target inclination of 90 degrees until the wellbore re-entered familiar gamma and conﬁrmed the location in zone. The turn was completed at 12,927’ MD and the directional team returned to taking ninety foot surveys for the duration of the lateral. Over the course of 400’ MD, the directional team was </p>

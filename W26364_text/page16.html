Based off the test results, individual well allocations with common ownership will be determined. Allocation testing will take place once every three months per NDAC 43-02-03-48. I. <br/>An allocation meter (mag meter for water, Coriolis for oil, and oriﬁce meter for gas) will be placed upstream of the tanks in the heater treater, but prior to the sales meter. This will ensure accurate measurement on an individual well basis prior to commingling into a sales meter. The bulk train will ﬂow through the sales meter (lact unit and/or gas meter) to determine a unit based sales volume, and in turn the allocation determined from test will determine the well by well sales volume. Please see the attached diagram for details of meter placement and ﬂow. <br/>  </p>

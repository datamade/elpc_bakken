Gamma markers throughout the Lodgepole and formation tops of the False Bakken, Upper Bakken Shale, and Middle Bakken were used to correlate with the Wahlstrom 152—102-34-27-4H, Simpson 3-14, Hart 1-9, Simpson 9-32, and Wahlstrom 3—10H showing a landing target around 10,879’ TVD, 2 feet higher from the original well prognosis landing target of 10,881” TVD. The curve reached TD of 11,201’ MD at 8:45 PM MST on August 9, <br/>2014 with a bit projection ofMD 11186 / INC 88.60 / AZ 16020 / TVD 10877.35 / VS 561.01. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale 11,022 ’ MD 10,854’ T VD -8, 560’ SS <br/>The top of the Upper Bakken Shale was picked at 11,022’ MD, 10,854’ TVD picked 3 feet higher than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and gamma ray. Background gas ranged from 3979-5337 units with average showing 4638 units. Drilling rates in the Upper Bakken Shale ranged from 0.23—1.47 minutes per foot with an average of 0.4 minutes per foot. Gamma ranged from 127-255 API with an average of 240 AP]. Typical samples were: SHALE: Black to dark gray, dark brown black, brittle, friable, compacted, carbonaceous, heavy dark oil staining, trace sandstone grains, light tan to tan, <br/>cream tan, ﬁne to very ﬁne, calcareous cementation, ﬁrm to ﬁiable, even yellow—green ﬂuorescence, fast good milky cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 11,074’ MD 10,86 7’ TVD -8,573 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken formation was picked at 11,074’ MD, 10,867’ TVD picked 2 feet higher than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and gamma ray. Background gas ranged from 365—4557 units with average of 2191 units. ROP averaged 0.69 minutes per foot with a range from 0. 194 .97 minutes per foot. Gamma showed a range of 50—78 API with an average of 60 API. Typical samples were: SANDSTONE: Gray, light gray, brown, tan, subangular to subrounded, argillaceous, fair sorting, calcareous, dolomitic, fair inter-granular porosity, light brown oil staining, patchy yellow-green ﬂuorescence, fast streaming broad cut. The curve reached TD of 11,201’ MD at 8:45 PM MST on August 9, 2014 with a bit projection of MD 11186 / INC 88.60 / AZ 160.20 / TVD 1087735 / VS 561.01. Aﬁer casing was set at 11,201’ MD, the rig moved and Lateral was resumed at a later date. <br/>Lateral #1 11,201’MD —12,224’MD <br/>DRILLING <br/>Drilling of the Lateral #1 began at 9:45 AM MST September 25, 2014. The plan for the lateral was to target 11’—1 5’ below the bottom of the base of the Upper Bakken Shale. Coming out of the shoe, the initial formation dip was projected at ~90.3 degrees and ~17 5.25 degrees azimuth. From the shoe to 12,224’ MD it was determined the dip was 90.0 degrees aﬁer tracking the Cool to Ratty gamma markers. At 11:00 AM MST on September 26, 2014 the decision was made to stop drilling due to well bore crossing the state designated Hard line. The Britt 151—102-4-9—4H Lateral #1 reached a total depth of 12,224’ MD. Drilling rates in the Middle Bakken formation ranged from 0.05—6.07 </p>

Drilling of Lateral Sidetrack #1 began at 4:45 PM MST September 28, 2014. The plan for the Lateral Sidetrack #1 was to target 11’-15’ below the bottom of the base of the Upper Bakken Shale. From the Whipstock to 1,500’ MD it was determined the dip was 90.0 degrees after tracking just below the Ratty gamma marker. At 11,500’ MD Dip was changed to 90.1 degrees while bit tracked below the Ratty gamma marker for the next 1,200’ MD. At 12,700’ MD Dip was changed to 9055 degrees while bit continued tracking from the Lower half of formation to just below the Ratty gamma marker for the next 800’ MD. At 13,500’ MD the dip was changed to 9085 degrees for the next 1,000’ of MD while the bit tracked under the Ratty gamma marker in the Middle Bakken. At 14,500’ MD the dip was changed to 90.7 degrees for the next 500’ of MD while continuing to drill between just beneath the Ratty gamma marker and the Lower half of formation. At 15,000’ MD the dip was changed to 90.5 degrees for the next 1,000’ of MD while the bit tracked between the Cool gamma marker and the Lower half of the Middle Bakken formation. At 16,000’ MD the dip was changed to 90.25 degrees for the next 500’ of MD while the bit tracked the Lower half of formation. At 16,500’ MD formation started leveling out to 90.0 degrees for the remainder of the well while the bit tracked from the Cool gamma marker to the Lower half of the Middle Bakken formation. The Britt 151-102—4-9—4H Lateral Sidetrack #1 reached a total depth of 20,761 ’ MD on October 2, 2014 at 4:50 PM MST. Drilling rates in the Middle Bakken formation ranged from 002—33. 18 minutes per foot with an </p>

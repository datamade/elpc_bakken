    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">A Baker mud motor and Security bit were used for the South Lateral. The TIH began until tagging cement where the cement, Float & Shoe and ten feet of new formation were drilled to perform the FIT test. After ﬁnishing with the FIT test drilling resumed with the South lateral with casing exited at a MD of 11,447’ at 2:30 am. CST on December 21, 2014. Drilling continued with the wellbore exiting casing at 87 degrees dropping through the upper portion of the Middle Bakken seeing the A to C faces transition and continuing to slowly drop through the target window towards the lower portion of the Middle Bakken target interval. Slides were done to begin working on the planned directional turn. Penetration rates averaged around 180 — 200 ﬂ/hr while rotating and around 90 — 100 ﬂ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 500 — 700 units with connection gases reaching as high as 960 units. The samples seen in the upper portion of the formation and through the target interval exhibited a light to medium tan/cream tan dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. </p>

Slides were done throughout the day for the planned directional turn as well as to keep the wellbore at or slightly above dip to continue tracking the target interval. After ﬁnishing the directional turn the wellbore continued to track the lower portion of the target until 13,400’ MD where the wellbore dropped out of the base of the target interval seeing the C to D faces transition in gamma. Slides were done throughout the night to work on keeping the wellbore pointed up to bring the wellbore up in TVD towards the base of the Middle Bakken target window. Aﬁer dropping about thirteen feet below the base of the target window the clean gamma from the lower limy secti0n of the Middle Bakken was seen indicating that the formation had steepened and the wellbore was sitting about three feet above the Lower Bakken Shale. Slides were done to keep the wellbore above the new dip of 90.45 degrees. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 250 — 300 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 80 — 100 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 300 — 800 units with connection gases reaching as high as 3,670 units. The samples seen throughout the lower portion of the Middle Bakken exhibited a cream tan/cream gray tan dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Day 3 15,085’ — 1 7,262’IWD Drilling continued with the wellbore tracking the lower portion of the formation <br/>with slides done to work on keeping the wellbore pointed up to bring the wellbore up in TVD away from the Lower Bakken Shale.

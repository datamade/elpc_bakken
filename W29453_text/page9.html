Prior to LACT installation, oil will be sold via a commingled tank battery and truck run tickets. Water will be measured via meters prior to delivery into a commingled tank battery. Commingled water will then be trucked off location via commingled run tickets. Dedicated water meters for each well will be used to allocate water truck volumes back to each well. </p>

The meter factor will represent the most recent valid meter factor based on quarterly master meter or tank proving. <br/>2. Measured daily well volume will be the measured oil volume that is delivered to the commingled tank battery, as recorded by the dedicated well coriolis meter, times the 313g factor. Measurement will be done continuously. Meter data will be stored and archived. <br/>3. Measured monthly well volumes will represent the sum of the prior months measured daily well volumes. <br/>4. The measured monthly pad volume will represent the sum of the measured monthly well volumes from each well on the pad. <br/>5. The custody transfer pad volume will represent the actual volume sold through run tickets. <br/>6. The monthly well sales volume will be calculated by multiplying the custody transfer pad <br/>volume times the measured monthly well volume divided by the measured monthly pad volume. <br/>  <br/>Prior to LACT installation, the water volume per well will be calculated as follows: <br/>1.

The measured monthly pad volume will represent the sum of the measured monthly well volumes from each well on the pad. <br/>4. The custody transfer pad volume will represent the sum of the actual volume removed from location via truck run tickets for the entire production month. <br/>5. The monthly well expense volume will be calculated by multiplying the custody transfer pad <br/>volume times the measured monthly well volume divided by the measured monthly pad volume. <br/>6.

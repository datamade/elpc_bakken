Survey interval may be decreased as needed to steer wellbore but will not be increased above the len ths listed above <br/>  <br/>The logging program will consist of the following: <br/>  <br/>       <br/>    <br/>  <br/>  <br/>    <br/>Lo T e —m_ Triple Combo Base of surface casin to KOP. GR to surface Cement Bond Log On intermediate casin <br/>     <br/>Through Curve and Lateral <br/>  <br/>The anticipated completion program is as follows: <br/>- After drilling the Three Forks lateral, a 4-1/2” production liner will be run from above KOP, inside the 7” intermediate casing, out to TD of the lateral and cemented. Lateral stimulation will consist of multiple frac stages, consisting of a slick water or hybrid system with proppant. All frac stages will be pumped down a “tie-back” string of 4-1/2” casing of similar or stronger weight and grade to that of the liner. The tie back string will be run from surface to the top of the production liner and will provide pressure isolation during fracture stimulation. <br/>Abnormal Pressures and HzS Gas <br/>No abnormal pressures or temperatures or other hazards are anticipated. HZS gas is not expected to be encountered in this wellbore, but precautions will be taken to monitor for the presence of H28 while drilling. </p>

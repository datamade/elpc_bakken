Layers of anhydrite, salt, shale and limestone made up the remainder of the Charles Formation. Drilling rates varied from the very fast 0.25 min/ft rate in the salt to 1.0 min/ﬂ in the harder limestone. Total gas was in the 50-75 unit range. <br/>Base Last Salt 9,146’ 1WD 9,13 7’ TVD —6, 789’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Base Last Salt was encountered at a measured depth of 9, 146’, TVD 9,137’, 23’ high to the prognosis depth. Rate of penetration rates were consistently in the .25 to .50 min/ﬂ range. Samples presented a distinct salt facies approximately 30' thick. A deﬁnite transition to limestone occurred at the BLS as ROP decreased to 0.5 min/ft. <br/>Total gas was in the 100 unit range. Mission Canyon 9,341 ’ MD 9,332’ T VD -6, 984’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon came in a L/ID 9,341' and TVD 9,332', 28’ high to the prognosis. ROP became erratic in the top 200' of the Mission Canyon formation but settled down to a more consistent 0.5 min/ﬂ as the well bore deepened. Total gas <br/>remained in the 100 unit range. Lodgepole 9, 982’ MD 9,972’ TVD -7,624’ SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,982’, TVD 9,972‘, 16’ high to the prognosis. The pick of the Lodgepole Formation was made primarily based on a slight change in the coloration of the limestone sample along with a slight increase in gamma from30 to 35 API. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Penetration rates through the Lodgepole Formation were inconsistent, ranging from 0.25 min/ﬂ to 0.5 min/ﬂ. Formation samples in the Lodgepole exhibited a very consistent, very hard, light to medium gray limestone with a transition to a medium to dark gray in the lower part of the formation. KOP at MD 10,460' was reached at 345am on January 25, 2015. <br/>Total gas readings remained in the 100—200 until reaching the KOP in the Lodgepole formation. Oil shows improved in the lower portion of the Lodgepole and exhibited fair porosity. </p>

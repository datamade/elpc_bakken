    <p class="styleSans13.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Spotted Hawk Development LLC Avalanche 36-15 TF1 was one of three (3) additional wells drilled on a single pad (Avalanche Pad) located in S36 151N 95W. The Avalanche 36-15 TF1 was drilled as a single horizontal lateral with the primary objective being in the Three Forks/Bench 1 formation. Target depth for the lateral was 23’ into the Three Forks dolostone. This well is located on Lot 3 Section 36, T151N, and R95W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Avalanche 36-15 TF1 spudded on January 20, 2015 and reached a total depth of 15,531’ MD on February 14, 2015. This well was drilled using an invert based mud system for the vertical and curve before switching to saltwater for the lateral. Dan Griffin and Lynda Griﬂ‘m of Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided well site mud logging services beginning at a depth of 7,000‘ in the Opeche Formation through total depth in the Three Forks target zone. Thirty foot (30’) lagged samples were caught, examined and logged throughout the vertical and curve with 100’ samples taken in the lateral. Samples will be sent to Spotted Hawk Development LLC and NDIC. <br/>The prognosis for the Avalanche 36-15 TF1 proved to be consistently low to the actual tops encountered through the upper section of the vertical well bore. As the well deepened, the prognosis was exactly on the formation top depths. The Charles Salt came in 24' high to the prognosis and the Base of the Last Salt came in 23’ high. The Mission Canyon came in 28' high, the Lodgepole 16' high, and the top of the Upper Bakken Shale came in 8’ high to the prognosis. The top of the Three Forks came in on prognosis keeping the TVD landing at the prognosis depth of 10,942'. Casing was set at MD 11,210’. </p>

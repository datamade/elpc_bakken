Production is then choked back to 28/64" for the remainder of the ﬂowback period. <br/>3) At the end of a 48 hour period the well is turned over to the production equipment on location for normal operation. <br/>*Floback gas is ﬂared using a 98% combustion efﬁcient ﬂare stck.

This method relies on compression and refrigeration to remove C3+ products from the ﬂared gas stream. Based on the sites gas composition it is possible to reduce VOC emissions on site by nearly 55%, and reduce CO; by 20% using these methods, and reclaim the majority of the NGL components of the gas stream. Any remaining unprocessed gas volumes will be sent to 98% combustion efﬁcient ﬂare. <br/>7 Additional Notes: <br/>The economics of connecting to the nearest pipeline are not favorable, therefore Slawson is not expecting to put in a connection. Instead Slawson will evaluate the costs of setting additional stripping equipment or curtailing the well to 200 BOPD. <br/>                                 </p>

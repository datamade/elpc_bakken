Once BHA was changed out and bottom was reached 3000-6000 units of trip gas were circulated out with a 15-35 foot ﬂare observed. Lateral was resumed at 10:05 PM MST on September 4, 2014. At 19,180’ MD a trip was preformed to change out MWD tool on September 5, 2014 at 1:00 AM MST. Once MWD tool was changed out and bottom was reached 30006000 units of trip gas were circulated out with a 15-35 foot ﬂare observed. Lateral was resumed at 6:20 PM MST on September 5, 2014 after gamma was re-logged. At 19,000’ MD the dip was changed to 89.6 degrees for the remainder of the lateral while the bit worked ﬁom the Upper to Lower half of the Middle Bakken formation. The Britt 151102-4-9-1H Lateral reached a total depth of 20,824’ MD on September 6, 2014 at 6:20 PM MST. Drilling rates in the Middle Bakken formation ranged from 0.12—8.07 minutes per foot with an average of 0.6 minutes per foot The bottom hole location was projected at MD 20824 / INC 9200 / AZ 178.30 / TVD 10854.31/VS 10098.02 <br/>GAMMA Gamma readings throughout Lateral were consistent in magnitude and range compared to the readings encountered during the curve. Gamma readings in the Middle <br/>Bakken formation ranged between 55 and 101 API and averaged 79 API during the <br/>lateral The target zone of 1 l ’-15’ below the bottom of the base of the Upper Bakken Shale </p>

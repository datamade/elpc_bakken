Road Pinedale 2 82941 <br/>DETAILS OF WORK Hunt Oil requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03 55. Hunt Oil intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application fro Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal wilI be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from gettting inito the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of or suspend any obligation under any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Hunt Oil understands NDAC 43~02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Hunt Oil will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig. <br/>{A/FO <br/>     <br/>E] Drilling Prognosis Spill Report <br/>                        <br/>  <br/>I:I Redriliing or Repair Shooting <br/>Casing or Liner Acidizing <br/>Plug Well Fracture Treatment Supplemental History Change Production Method <br/>Temporarily Abandon Reclamation <br/>Other Suspension of Drilling <br/>    <br/>24-HOUR PRODUCTION RATE <br/>     <br/>          <br/>Oil Bbls Oil Bbls Water Bbls Water Bbls Gas MCF Gas MCF <br/>         <br/>  <br/>                                                                                        <br/>    <br/>   <br/>     <br/>   <br/>       <br/>. 0T1 ' ‘ Company Telephone Number Hunt Oil Com an 1900 North Akard Street City Zip Code Dallas , 1 Texas 75201—2300 <br/> /’ Printed Name <br/>" ' ‘4 Chad Conin - <br/>Title Date Senior Staff Drillin - En - ineer Au - ust 14th, 2014 <br/>Email Address cconin ' <br/>m4 W0 4r T0 <br/>FOR STATE USE ONLY <br/>E <br/>ENGINEERING TECHNICIAIx- <br/>  <br/>untoil.com <br/>    </p>

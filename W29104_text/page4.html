    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Curve <br/>Casing occurred from the 7th of November to the 8th of November at which time tanks were changed over to salt water and 7” casing was placed in two sections. The ﬁrst was <br/>HCP -110 LTC 26# 7” casing set at 5,508’MD, followed by HCP —1 10 LTC 32# 7” casing set at 9,503’. See cement report. <br/>Lateral 9, 594’ MD- 19, 659’ MD <br/>Returning to bottom at 7:38 PM on November 8th of 2014 initial samples circulated up showed the cement was still green. Operations were halted for 12 hours to allow cement to set. <br/>When drilling resumed the Upper Gamma Marker was observed at 9,594’ MD at a TVD of 9,320’. Gamma rose to 173 API and dropped to average 70-80 API. Gas out of the shoe and into the Upper Gamma Marker averaged 2,000 units. (Methane and propane were most prominent). Based on the Parshall 403 —3534H and the Upper Gamma Marker, waypoint 1 was set at 9,700’ MD between 9,320’ and 9,330’ TVD and extended to 11,000’ MD between 9,332 and 9,342’ TVD. <br/>Drilling ahead to 10,050’ MD samples consisted of a gray to light gray argillaceous dolomite with instant streaming to blooming green blue cuts and even bright green ﬂuorescence. Gamma averaged 120 API indicating a steeper than expected down dip and the well bore had not been able to achieve a position below the Upper Gamma Marker. In light of this waypoint 2 was issued effectively dropping the target window to between at TVD of 9,330” and 9,340’TVD at a measured depth of 10,100”, and extending to 11,000’ measured depth between 9,341 ’ and 9,351’ TVD. The Upper gamma marker was reached at 10,042’ MD (TVD 9,332’) yielding a local dip of 89.2 degrees. <br/>Once the Upper Gamma Marker was penetrated samples consisted of a cream to frosted tan, unconsolidated rounded dolomite. Gamma dropped to average 60-75 API while gas jumped up to average 3000 units while open to the gas buster. Heavy gases rose as oil became visible over the shakers. <br/>Reaching a measured depth of 10,3 50’, surveys were shot in 30’ intervals as the lateral turn began. The turn was to bring the azimuth from 287 degrees to 320 degrees for a total tangent curve of 60 degrees. The turn was completed at 11,3 75’ MD. While the curve was being built the wellbore dropped slightly out of the window reaching a TVD low of 9,353 .44’. During this portion of the well samples changed slightly from a tan color to tan gray sub angular, argillaceous dolomite with positive oil shows and traces of pyrite. Gas </p>

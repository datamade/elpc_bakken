Gamma became very consistent form 77 to 80 API indicating the wellbore may be low in formation. Waypoint 2 was revised upward to a TVD window from 9,338-9,348’ TVD. <br/>From 11,200’ MD to 12,600’ samples remained fairly consistent ranging from a frosted tan to gray in areas where gamma was lower than 70 API, to a gray to frosted gray argillaceous dolomite in areas where gamma reached 77 to 80 API. ROP through this area averaged 300’/hr. As we reached 12,450’ MD at a TVD of 9,352’. Gamma grew more consistent indicating the wellbore was low in the formation. A slide was put in place at 12600’ MD up however, did not yield enough to avoid a lower shale strike. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The lower shale strike occurred at 12,668’ MD (9,354.84’TVD). Samples showed only 5% lower Bakken shale and no change in differential pressure, weight, or ROP was observed. Corrective slides were placed to successﬁilly bring the well bore up in TVD. It was estimated that 28 feet of Lower Bakken shale was exposed. <br/>Aﬁer review of the strike structure showed a steep down dip of 89.1 degrees until approximately 10,300’ MD at which point the Middle Bakken began to level off near a dip of 89.75 degrees. Waypoint 3 was revised bringing the wellbore up in TVD between 9,344’ and 9,3 54’ TVD and extending to 14,000’ MD to 9,339’ and 9349’ respectively. <br/>Bringing the wellbore up to a TVD of 9,340’ at a measured depth of 13,648’, the Upper Gamma Marker was observed conﬁrming a dip near 89.8 degrees. Samples in the midsection of the Middle Bakken consisted of a tan gray to light gray sub rounded dolomite <br/>with diminishing oil shows (due to a mud weight of 98+) and gas averaging 1500 units. ROP maintained a speed of 300’/hr. <br/>Maintaining the target window from 14,100’ MD to 15,400’ MD gamma averaged 70 API while gas averaged 600 units. Samples showed little to no change indicating the wellbore was positioned just below the Upper gamma Marker. At 15,3 88’ MD the Upper gamma marker was re -examined conﬁrming a dip of 89.84 degrees. <br/>On November 11, 2014 at 10:50 AM the Parshall 404-3534H reached a TD of 15,820’ MD at a TVD of9,342.72’. </p>

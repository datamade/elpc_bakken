Upon abandonment of the herein authorized road, the reserved soil shall be salvaged from the road ditches, backslopes and fill slopes; gravel or scoria shall be removed; the roadbed shall be completely obliterated and recontoured to conform to the adjacent natural terrain; and the reserved soil shall be evenly respread on the disturbed areas. <br/>5. Revegetation: All disturbed soil surfaces resulting from construction, maintenance, or reclamation of the herein authorized road, shall be revegetated with a mixture of native perennial grasses listed in Exhibit "D" sufficient to prevent accelerated erosion and restore, as closely as possible, the original long-term productivity. The use of any other seed mixtures shall be subject to the prior written approval of the ND Department of Trust Lands. Reclamation shall not be deemed completed until erosion is controlled, the surface is revegetated with a mixture of native <br/>grasses, and written approval is issued by the ND Department of Trust Lands. f <br/>g tsuwortuicu-ms‘sunace oar-nae aymrsmgl emerald oil doc </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">ue to excessive differential spikes, drilling was suspended at 17.905' MD, at 1:30 pm November 13, 2014. TOH commenced. <br/>TOH. Ran wireline logs for cement bond and casing. Laid down tools, picked up tools, TIH. <br/>Relogged MWD GR starting at 17,842‘ MD. Maximum trip gas was 5,085 units, prior to routing ﬂow through the gas buster. <br/>Resumed drilling lateral at 5:30 pm November 14, 2014. <br/>ROP averaged 110-200 feet/hour on rotation. <br/>Background gas averaged 200-600 units, with connection gas averaging 1500 units, maximum of 2161 units. <br/>Strong petroliferous, dark brown- green oil shows continued to be observed in drill cutting samples. <br/>Bottomhole temperature was 269°. Gas detector was inspected and serviced: ice buildup removed from gas trap vent line. <br/>Performed dip calculation: 17,026' MD (11,035.13' TVD) vs 18,522' MD (11,040.75' TVD) = 89.785°. <br/>As the "D-E" GR signature was encountered, in conjunction with a corresponding dip calculation, the target was adjusted at 18,772‘ MD at 8:00 am November 15 2014. Target dip: 89.58°, transitioning into 89.69°. <br/>ROP averaged 80-200 feet/hour on rotation, 20-35 feet/hour while sliding. <br/>Background gas continued to increase and averaged 400-1,000 units, with connection gas averaging 1,800 units, maximum of 5,640 units. The wellbore dropped out of the bottom of the target zone at 19,031‘ MD, reentering the target zone at 19,222' MD. <br/>Oil content was 2%, according to drilling ﬂuid engineer. Bottomhole temperature was 294°. Gas detector was inspected and serviced: ice buildup removed from gas trap vent line and air ﬂow ﬁttings. <br/>The wellbore remained near the middle to lower half of the assigned target zone throughout the day. <br/>ROP averaged 80-210 feet/hour on rotation, 8-25 feet/hour while sliding. <br/>Background gas increased, and averaged 800-1,3 00 units, with connection gas averaging 2,600-3,500 units, maximum of 5,450 units. <br/>The wellbore reached the top of the assigned target zone at ~20,100‘ MD before responding to multiple downward slides. <br/>Calibrated gas detector; zeroed unit out and test gas bump of 1500+ units. <br/>Bottomhole temperature was 277°. <br/>The wellbore dropped towards the center of the assigned target zone. <br/>Background gas remained high, averaging 800-1,800 units. <br/>Connection gas averaged 3,400 units, maximum of 3,995 units. <br/>Due to down hole motor failure, drilling was suspended at 20,329' MD, at 6:30 am November 17, 2014. TOH commenced. Laid down tools, picked up tools. Proceeded to TIH. <br/>TIH. Washed to bottom ﬁnal two stands. Maximum trip gas was 8,716 units, prior to routing through gas buster. </p>

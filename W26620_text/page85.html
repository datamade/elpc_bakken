This pick was made with limited conﬁdence due to presence of a directional slide negating utility of ROP signature to make a precise identiﬁcation. <br/>Bottomhole temperature was 201.0 degrees. <br/>Base of Last Salt 9,4 78 ’ MD 9,4 71 ’ T VD -6,8 78 ’ SS <br/>The Base of Last Salt marker arrived one foot higher than prognosis, at 9,471' TVD. ROP following the BLS marker averaged 60-80 feet/hour on rotation. Background gas averaged 11-34 units, with no notable connection gas observed. <br/>Rival 9,651 ’MD 9, 644’ TVD -7, 051 ’SS <br/>The Rival Porosity Zone was identiﬁed at 9,644' TVD, which was eight feet higher than prognosis. <br/>ROP within the Rival averaged 60-70 feet/hour on rotation. Background gas increased slightly, averaging 22-34 units. <br/>Sherwood Porosity 9, 780’MD 9, 773’ T VD -7,180’SS <br/>The Sherwood Porosity Zone came in at 9,773' TVD, which was one foot lower than prognosis. <br/>ROP averaged 50-80 feet/hour. Background gas was minimal, and averaged 11 units. Connection gas averaged 120 units. Bottomhole temperature was 188.0 degrees. <br/>Lodgepole 10,187’MD 10,180’ TVD -7,587’SS </p>

Background gas increased and averaged 30-60 units. <br/>Connection gas averaged 130 units. <br/>Drilling suspended at 10,3 77' MD at 8:00 am November 1, 2014 due to downhole motor failure. TOH commenced. Laid down vertical BHA, picked up curve-building BHA. TIH with curve building assembly. Resumed drilling vertical at 9:30 pm November 1 2014. Maximum trip gas was just 99 units, however maintenance to shaker was underway when circulating at bottom. <br/>The curve target was lowered by four feet (to 11,051‘ TVD) prior to the start of the curvebuilding process. This target adjustment was made based on encountered formation tops observed on previous well on this pad. Further target adjustments were expected as MWD-GR <br/>correlations were calculated during the curve-building process. Started building the curve at 10,525' MD at 1:40 am November 2, 2014. <br/>The initial seven Lodgepole gamma signatures correlated against the previous well logged on this pad, calculating to the curve target trending lower. In response, the target was lowered 7' TVD, to 11,058' TVD. <br/>Background gas within the Lodgepole increased, averaging 50-70 units. Connection gas averaged 73 units. </p>

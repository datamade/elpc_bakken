Target assigned at 12,575' MD, at 5:20 am November 10, 2014. Target dip: 90.190. The wellbore reentered the assigned target zone at 12,616' MD. <br/>Background gas averaged 200-300 units, with connection gas averaging 400-800 units, maximum 971 units. ROP averaged 100-150 feet/hour on rotation, 20-35 feet/hour while sliding. <br/>A strong, petroliferous odor was noted at the shakers, with brown-to- gold oil sheen observed in samples. <br/>Gas detector was inspected and serviced; ice buildup removed from gas trap intake. Bottomhole temperature was 225.0 degrees. <br/>Performed dip calculation: 12,456' MD (11,045.04' TVD) vs 13,637' MD (11,043.54‘ TVD) = 90.073°, 13,011' MD (11,049.38' TVD) vs 14,085‘ MD (11,044.62' TVD) = 90.254°. No change was immediately made to the assigned target of 90.19°, with predictions of steepening structure expected within 1,500 feet. <br/>A later, very localized dip calculation yielded a dip of 90.198". ROP averaged 150-220 feet/hour on rotation, increasing to 250+ feet/hour for brief spans. ROP while sliding averaged 25-55 feet/hour. <br/>Background gas averaged 110-200 units. Connection gas averaged 300-450 units, maximum of 853 units. Strong petroliferous, dark brown oil shows continued to be observed in drill cutting samples. <br/>Another dip calculation revealed structure of 90.289°. In response to continued indications of formation structure climbing above 90.25 degrees, a target dip of 9043" was assigned at 15,514‘ MD, at 1:15 am November 12 2014. <br/>Gas detector was inspected and serviced; ice buildup removed from gas trap intake. <br/>At 10:45 am November 12 2014, 16,210' MD, a new target was assigned as per consultation with Petro-Hunt Senior Geologists. Target dip: 90.46 degrees, transitioning to 90 degrees and then 89.57 degrees. This target was prescribed based upon anticipated crest of dip reversal. <br/>Shortly thereafter, at 16,3 95' MD, assignment of a new target was necessitated due to arrival of the "G" packstone lobe. Directional driller was notiﬁed immediately and advised of target dip of 90°. GR detection as low as 21 API was observed starting at 16,317' MD (lagged). GR detection indicated that structure is in fact dropping, not merely ﬂattening (having passed over the crest, essentially). As such, prompt corrective action of targeting 898° was required, and reﬂected in a new target assignment at 16,470' MD. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">wellbore pointed up as the wellbore would drop in rotary and start to see the lower dirtier gamma from the start of the C to D faces transition. The wellbore began to head up section at a MD of 16,750' at 90.5 - 91 degrees. As the wellbore began to rapidly head up section the clean gamma from the top of the target window was seen indicating that the formation had ﬂatted slightly and the wellbore exited the top of the Middle Bakken target with slides done turning the wellbore around and dropping in TVD back into the target interval with a calculated dip of 90.2 degrees. Penetration rates with the new assembly averaged around 110 —— 130 ﬁlm while rotating and around 30 - 40 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 700 — 900 units while running through the gas buster with a 5’ to 10’ ﬂare seen while drilling. The samples seen from the Middle Bakken target interval continued to exhibit a cream gray tan/cream tan dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut with traces of limestone and siltstone present. <br/>Day 7 17,850’—19,900’ <br/>Drilling continued through the target window with the wellbore steadily tracking the Middle Bakken target interval with surveys averaging around 89.6 to 90.5 degrees. Around a MD of 18,900' the wellbore began to drop in rotary with inclinations around 89.5 degrees. As the wellbore began to drop in TVD the heat up from the C to D faces transition was seen indicating that the formation had begun to steepen up from 90.2 degrees to 90.4 degrees. Slides were done throughout the night and the wellbore began to build in TVD back into the Middle Bakken target window seeing the C faces repeat giving the formation a calculated dip rate of 90.1 degrees as the wellbore began to drop in rotary again towards the lower portion of the target window. Drilling continued throughout the day with slides done to work on keeping the wellbore pointed up to allow the wellbore to slowly build in TVD back into and continue to track the Middle Bakken target window to TD of the S lateral. <br/>Drilling continued through the Middle Bakken target window to 20,940’ MD. Total depth of the South lateral was called at 20,940’ MD for the Skedsvold #21—H with the wellbore ending in the upper portion of the Middle Bakken. The formation throughout the lateral had an overall estimated dip rate of 90.2 degrees. Total depth of the South Lateral was reached at 20,940’ MD at7200 pm. CST on November 12, 2014 with 9,667’ of open horizontal hole drilled. </p>

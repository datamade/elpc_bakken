Slides were done throughout the night to work on keeping the wellbore pointed down to drop back into the Middle Bakken target window. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 110 — 130 ft/hr while rotating and around 20 30 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 600 - 800 units with connection gases reaching as high as 4,445 units. The samples seen in the upper portion of the Middle Bakken target window continued to exhibit a cream gray tan/gray tan dolomite with traces of limestone and siltstone present and an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence. </p>

The assembly slowly built throughout the day between slides and the formation appeared to be running down section at 89.7 degrees. Slides were done throughout the night and the wellbore reentered the Middle Bakken target window at 15,000’ MD seeing the clean gamma from the A to C faces transition giving the formation a calculated dip rate of 89.89 degrees. At around a MD of 15,240’ MD the mud motor experienced multiple differential pressure spikes and at a MD of 15,291’ the decision was made to TOOH due to Mud Motor failure. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 110 — 120 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 30 ~ 40 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 400 — 600 units while running through the gas buster with a 5’ to 10’ ﬂare seen while drilling. The samples seen in the upper portion of the formation continued to exhibit a cream tan/light to medium tan dolomite with traces of limestone and siltstone present and an <br/>even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Day 5 15,291 ’ — 16,200’ MD <br/>The TOOH was completed with a new Bit, Mud Motor and MWD tool picked up. The TIH began until reaching bottom where trip gases were circulated out of the hole before drilling resumed reaching as high as 859 units while running through the gas buster with a 10’ —— 15’ ﬂare seen. Drilling resumed with the wellbore steadily dropping in through the target window seeing the lower dirtier gamma from the start of the C to D faces transition indicating that the formation dip had changed from the previous 89.7 degrees to 90.3 degrees. Penetration rates with the new assembly averaged around 100 — 130 ft/hr while rotating and around 30 — 40 ft/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 400 — 600 units. The samples in the lower portion of the formation exhibited a cream gray tan/gray tan dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. <br/>Day 6 16,200’ — 1 7,850’ MD <br/>Drilling continued with the S lateral with the wellbore steadily tracking the lower portion of the Middle Bakken target interval.

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Mission Canyon formation was encountered at a measured depth of 9,650’, true vertical depth of 9,629’, one foot low to prognosis. The top of the Mission Canyon was picked oﬁ‘ an increase in penetration rates as well as comparisons to the offsetting wells porosity benches throughout the Mission Canyon. Penetration rates throughout the majority of the Mission Canyon averaged around 120 — 140 ﬁ/hr with increases up to 160 ﬁlm seen throughout the different porosity benches. The samples throughout the upper 100' of the formation exhibited primarily a gray brown/gray tan limestone with trace to moderate anhydrite present and occasional dolomite mixed in. The remainder of the formation exhibited primarily limestone with trace amounts of cream to off-white anhydrite present Background gases averaged around 60 —— 80 units. <br/>Lodgepole 10,143’MD 10,121’ TVD -7,840’SS <br/>The Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a measured depth of 10,143’, True vertical depth of 10,121 ’, fourteen feet high to prognosis. The Lodgepole formation was picked at the base of the lower Mission Canyon porosity as well as a sample change from a cream gray tan limestone to a cream gray/light to medium gray limestone. Penetration rates throughout the formation down to KOP averaged around 120 - 140 ﬁ/hr with background gases averaging around 70 - 90 units. KOP was reached at 9:20 pm. CDT on November 1, 2014 at a measured depth of 10,450'. <br/>Curve 10,450' —— 11,293 ’ MD <br/>The curve for the South lateral was started in the Lodgepole Formation at a measured depth of 10,450' at 11:00 am. CST on November 2, 2014. An 8 3/4” Hughes bit and 2.25 degree ﬁxed mud motor were used to build the curve. The landing target for the Skedsvold #21-4H at the beginning of the curve was set at 10,949’ @ 90 deg. based oﬁ‘ the Lodgepole top and the ﬁrst LP marker. The Skedsvold # 150-101-4B-9—1H and the Skedsvold #21—4—3H were used for correlation purposes through the curve. Penetration rates at the beginning of the curve averaged around 70 - 80 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases through the Lodgepole formation averaged around 85 — 100 units. The lithology of the Lodgepole exhibited primarily a cream gray tan/light to medium gray limestone with occasional anhydrite and shale present. Gamma markers began to show that the lower portion of the Lodgepole had thickened slightly. After seeing this, the TVD landing target was lowered to a TVD of 10,950’. The remainder of the Lodgepole formation was drilled out and the False Bakken was encountered. <br/>False Bakken 11, 057' MD 10, 909’ T VD -8,628 ’ SS <br/>The False Bakken was encountered at a measured depth of 11,057’, true vertical depth of 10,909’, three feet high to prognosis. Aﬁer seeing the False Bakken top the TVD landing target remained at a true vertical depth of 10,950’ @ 90 degrees based off the isopaching from the False Bakken to the Middle Bakken target area in the oﬁ‘set </p>

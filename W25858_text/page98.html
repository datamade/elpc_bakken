While diilling the cuwe, gamma and sample correlations were used to aid in landing within the Middle Bakken. The initial target TVD was for landing the curve was 10,934’. While building the curve, the ROP was near lOOft/hr. <br/>Upper Bakken Shale: 10,987’ MD 10,889’ TVD -8,933 ’ SS </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Bakken Shale was drilled at a TVD of 10,889’. The shale was brownish black, with a slightly silty appearance. It was ﬁrm, slightly calcareous and subblocky to blocky. Occasional micro-pyrite was seen in the samples. The shale had spotty ﬂuorescence and a slow streaming cut. The penetration rate was less than 1 min/ft while in the shale. The background gas increased after ﬁrst getting into the shale to as high as 1,889 units, then gradually decreased to <br/>near 1,000 units. </p>

The samples were composed of siltstone. It was medium gray to tan in color. It was moderately argillaceous, calcareous to limey in part, and had poor induration. The siltstone had poor porosity, and interbedded dolomite. The dolomite was micro to very ﬁne grained, and limey and sucrosic in part. The samples had spotty dull yellow ﬂuorescence, and fast cloudy cuts. Background gas while drilling in the Middle Bakken Siltstone was near 800 units. Drilling within the Bakken continued to a measure depth of 1 1,183’. This was called TD of the curve at 2: 10 AM CT <br/>December 21, 2014. <br/>Lateral 11,183 ’—21, 765 ’ </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling of the lateral was started after seven inch casing was set at 11,162’, and the drilling fluid was changed from oil based to salt water. The cement and casing shoe were drilled out with a PDC bit and directional tools. Upon drilling out into open formation, the background gas was near 90 units. The curve was landed with an inclination near 88 degrees, at a TVD of 10,932’. While drilling out laterally, the decision was made to slowly come up in section. While drilling ahead, slides for azimuth were used to turn the well path from 151 to 180 degrees. The ROP was near 200ft/hr while rotating. The inclination remained below 90 degrees, until a survey depth of 1 1,382’. The inclination slowly increased to as high as 91.42 degrees, at a survey depth of 1 1,414’. Downward slides were then used to level out the inclination to near 90 degrees. <br/>Slides at the beginning of each stand were used to turn the well path for azimuth. The ROP while rotating was near 250ft/hr. An increase in metal shavings was seen in the samples near 12,150’. The azimuth turn was completed at 12,884ft, and the survey interval was increased from 30’, to 90’. The ROP decreased to less than lOOft/hr. The decision was made to trip out of the hole at a measured depth of 13,941 ’. The bit, mudmotor, shock sub, and agitator were all changed out at this time. Drilling resumed in the lateral after tripping in the hole and circulating out the trip gas. The ROP with the new BHA was near 250ft/hr. The background gas was near 400 units. In addition, a l-5ft ﬂare, was seen while diverting the flow through the gas buster. </p>

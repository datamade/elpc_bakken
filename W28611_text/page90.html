    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">A downslide was put in at 11,485’ MD to prevent the wellbore form exiting through the top of the target window. This slide would send the wellbore into the lower portion of the target window. 2 high side slides were put in at 11,823’ MD and 11,972’ MD. <br/>These slides and the rise in rotation would send the wellbore into the upper portion of the target window. A down slide was put in at 12,688’ MD to prevent the continued rise in the wellbore. This slide would send the wellbore through the base of the target window at 13,010’ MD. <br/>3 high side slides were put in at 12,908’ MD to bring the wellbore back up in the formation. The wellbore would re-enter the target window at 13,520’ MD. The rise in the formation would continue and send the wellbore into the upper portion of the target window. 3 downslides were put in at 13,602’ MD. <br/>These slides would send the wellbore back into the lower portion of the target window. Drilling would continue in this lower portion until the rise in rotation would send the wellbore rising at 14,625’ MD. The wellbore would exit through the top of the target window at 15,225’ MD. 2 downslides were put in at 14,768’ MD, with a third being needed at 15,398’ MD to send the wellbore back down in the formation. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling would continue in the middle portion of the target window until 16,717’ MD when a rise in rotation was seen. A downslide was put in at 16,917’ MD to level the wellbore off. This slide would send the wellbore dropping in the formation. <br/>Several high side slides were needed to send the wellbore back up in the formation starting at 17,417’ MD. The wellbore would exit through the base of the target <br/>window at 17,400’ MD and re-enter at 17,730’ MD. 2 downslides were put in at 17,858’ MD to level the wellbore off in the formation. <br/>Drilling would continue in the target window from this point until the rise in rotation would send the wellbore rising up and out of the target window at 18,700’ MD. 4 downslides were put in starting at 18,613’ MD to bring the wellbore back down in the formation and back into the target window. The wellbore would re—enter the target window at 19,240’ MD. <br/>A high side slide was put in at 19,466’ MD to level the wellbore off in the <br/>formation. The remainder of the well was drilled in rotation in the target window to the TD of 20,505’ MD, reached at 10:30 AM CST on Saturday, August 23, 2014. </p>

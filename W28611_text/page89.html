    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Bartleson 13—18—3XH curve was drilled with a Security MMDSSM 8.75” bit along with a Baker Hughes mud motor set to 2.4 degrees and an invert mud system. <br/>There was a 30’ rotation made from this point before the sliding for the curve commenced at the kick off point of 9,805’ MD. <br/>FALSE BAKKEN 10,391 ’ MD 10,280’ T VD -8,206’ SS <br/>At 10,391’ MD the False Bakken came in at 10,280’ TVD, 11’ low to prognosis. The gamma reached 141.36 API units while in the False Bakken. The samples for the False Bakken consisted of cream gray to gray tan, with blocky to platy limestone. The samples had weak milky yellow cuts with a peak of 202 units of gas seen in this interval. <br/>SCALLION 10,394’ MD 10,283 ’ T VD -8,209’ SS <br/>The Scallion was the next formation encountered. The scallion came in at 10,394’ MD and 10,283’ TVD, 8’ low to prognosis. The gamma cooled back down to 47.86 API units in the Scallion. The Scallion consisted of mostly cream buff Limestone with slow dull milky yellow cuts. Gas peaked at 2065 units of gas along with fair milky cuts. </p>

The gamma reached 684.02 units at this point. Background gas averaged 317.48 units, peaking 803 units. Samples in the Upper Bakken were black, carbonaceous blocky shale, with instant milky yellow cuts. <br/>MIDDLE BAKKEN 10, 443’ MD 10,311 ’ T VD -8,23 7’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at a MD of 10,443’ MD and 10,311’ TVD, 7’ low to the prognosis. The Middle Bakken was picked based on the change in samples and a decrease in gamma from 684102 units down to 62.95 units API. The Middle Bakken samples consisted mostly of a light to dark cream gray tan platy siltstone. Gas peaked at 1729 units of gas along with fair milky cuts. The curve was landed at a total depth of 10,623’ MD at 10,352’ TVD on Wednesday, July 30, 2014 at 1:30 PM CST. 7” intermediate casing was set to 10,608’ MD. </p>

The wellbore would begin rising gradually in the formation following the drilling of the shoe. A downslide was put in at 10,717’ MD to prevent the wellbore from rising into the upper portion of the target window. Drilling would continue in the lower portion of the target window until a deﬂection up was taken at 11,175’ MD. </p>

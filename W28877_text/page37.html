    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation’s Solberg 31-2TFH is located in the NWNE of Section 2 T156N R97W in Williams County, North Dakota, drilled as a multi well pad with the Solberg 41-2TFX, 41-2H, 31-2WH, and 21—2TFH. The Solberg 312TFH was the ﬁrst vertical and curve drilled on the Solberg 2 pad. The Solberg 3 l-2H is a horizontal well with the two mile lateral across sections 2 and 11, targeting the Three Forks formation. Bottom hole location is in the SESE of Section 11 T156N R97W. The Solberg 31-2TFH was spudded August 27, 2014 at 2:00 am and reached a total measured depth of 20,905’ on October 23, 2014 at 5:50 pm. Wellsite geological services provided by Jessica Stark and Jen Meidinger of Neset Consulting Service began at 7,200’. A Total Gas Detection system was utilized for gas analysis. Samples were caught every thirty feet throughout the vertical and curve and every ﬁfty feet throughout the lateral, as well as intermediate samples when necessary. One set of samples was washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. </p>

The lower Amsden consisted of light pink red dolomitic siltstone. <br/>Tyler 7,222 ’ MD 7,218’ TVD -4, 926 ’ SS <br/>The top of the Tyler marker was picked using gamma. The Tyler came in 15’ high to the prognosis. The ﬁrst sample in the Tyler was a red orange siltstone with poor porosity. As drilling continued the samples transitioned to a brick red ﬁssile shale. Overall the Tyler had poor porosity and little oil shows. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.23 to 1.83 minutes per foot and averaged 0.63 minutes per foot. Total gas ranged from 22 to 79 units and averaged 24 units. <br/>Kibbey Lime 7, 771 ’ MD 7, 768’ T VD -5,4 76 ’ SS </p>

The Charles came in 15’ low to the prognosis. Samples changed from a red orange sandstone to salt. A total of 3 salt beds, along with beds of dolomite, anhydrite, and limestone, were encountered in the Charles formation. Rate of penetration ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 minutes per foot and averaged 0.39 minutes per foot. Total gas in the Charles ranged from 22 to 146 units and averaged 54 units. </p>

A subsequent drop in gas was seen when the bit was brought down. There were no visible oil shows while drilling. Water weights were fairly high at 9.8 to 10 pounds in this section. Refer to Appendix A to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The bit entered this section 2’ below the top of target zone and leveled off following dip. At approximately 15,500’ MD a slight change in dip was seen and the bit came up to the top of target zone, locking in for 500’ until taking a bounce down at 16,500’ MD. At this point there were some unexpected reactions from the bit and control was slightly affected with the bit building to 2° over dip from 16,900’ until a series of aggressive slides ﬁnally stopped the ascent at 17,300’ MD. This area that gave us these control problems also showed some erratic gamma changes and ‘ratty’ differential pressures. With also seeing a corresponding increase of gas there is a good possibility the bit passed through a fractured area of zone. Aﬁer leveling off, the bit started to drop and reached the end of this section of drilling 2-3’ above the target zone. <br/>This section showed very similar gas readings to the previous section and increases and decreases can be readily seen with even small separations from the top of target zone. There were no visible oil shows through this section and water weights were kept at 9.9 to 10.1 pounds. Refer to Appendix B to see correlation of wellbore to oil and gas shows as well as water weight correlation. </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The bit entered this section trending below dip and leveled off on top of the hard streak at 17,650’ MD, remaining there until breaking through at 17,950’ MD. Aﬁer breaking through, the bit leveled off 3’ below the top of target zone until a bounce off of the lower hard streak brought it up to the top of target zone, scraping along underneath the top hard streak. At 19,450’ MD the bit came off the top of target and began to drop. Attempts to slide failed and at 19,774’ MD a trip was made for a motor failure. After getting to bottom the MWD failed and drilling continued to a depth of 19,825’ MD in an attempt to get signal back. After failing to ﬁx the issue the tool was wirelined out and back in. Drilling resumed with the bit still dropping until seeing another MWD failure. At 19,962’ MD the tool was wirelined once again. Drilling resumed with the bit dropping to the bottom of target zone where it leveled off brieﬂy and began to come up through zone, building on rotation, until taking a bounce off of the lower hard streak at 20,900’ MD Two small slides were put in to control the drop and the bit leveled off in the middle of zone. Drilling continued rotating out until reaching a TD of 21,486’ MI) at 12:20 am CT on November 10, 2014, showing the bit 3’ above the bottom of target zone. BHL ofthe lateral was 230.93’ FNL & 1,304.09’ FEL of Section 13 T150N R97W. </p>

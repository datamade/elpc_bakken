At 12,000’ MD Dip was changed to 90.0 degrees while bit tracked from the F marker to the base of the target window for the next 800’ MD. At 12,800’ MD Dip was changed to 89.9 degrees while the bit tracked the E marker for the next 1,000’ MD. At 13,800’ MD the dip was changed to 90.0 degrees for the next 1,500’ of MD while the bit tracked from the E marker to the upper half of the Three Forks formation. At 15,300’ MD the dip was changed to 90.2 degrees for the next 700’ of MD while the bit tracked from the base of the target window to the upper half of the Three Forks. At 16,000’ MD the dip was changed to 90.0 degrees for the next 500’ of <br/>MD aﬁer gamma markers showed the bit tracking from the base of the target window to just below the F marker in the Three Forks formation. At 16,794’ MD a trip was preformed to change out BHA due to slow penetration rates on January 30, 2015 at 1:30 AM MST. Once BHA was changed out the lateral was resumed at 5:00 PM MST on January 30, 2015. At 16,500’ MD the dip was changed to 90.1 degrees for the next 1,500’ of MD aﬁer gamma markers showed the bit tracking from the F marker to the target window in the Three Forks formation. At 18,000’ MD the dip was changed to 89.8 degrees for the next 1,000’ of MD while the bit tracked from the base of the target window to the upper half of the Three Forks. At 19,400’ MD a trip was preformed to change out MWD tool on February 1, 2015 at 6:00 AM MST. Once MWD tool was changed out and bottom was reached the lateral was resumed at 7:00 AM MST on February 2, 2015. At 19,000’ MD the dip was changed to 90.0 degrees for the remainder of the well while the bit tracked from the center of the target window to just below the F marker in the Three Forks formation. The State 154—102-25—36-10TFH Lateral reached a total depth of 20,309’ MD on February 2, 2015 at 9:20 PM MST. Drilling rates in the Three Forks formation ranged from 003—14.] 5 minutes per foot with an average of 0.64 minutes per foot. The bottom hole location was projected at MD 20309 / INC 87.00 / AZ 180.70 / TVD 10765.55 / VS 9771.66. </p>

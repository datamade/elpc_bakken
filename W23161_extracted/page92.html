Background gas ranged from 34—247 units with average of 129 units. ROP averaged 0.96 minutes per foot with a range from 047—] .5 minutes per foot. Gamma showed a range of 56—78 API with an average of 66 API. Typical samples were: SANDSTONE: Light medium gray, gray, brown gray, subangular to angular, argillaceous, poor sorting, calcareous, dolomitic cementation, fair inter-granular porosity, trace shale, fair brown oil staining, even yellow-green ﬂuorescence, slow thin streaming cut </p>

Background gas ranged from 84-393 units with average showing 163 units. Drilling rates below the top of the Lower Bakken Shale ranged from 0.43—48 minutes per foot with an average of 119 minutes per foot. Gamma ranged from 77-255 API with an average of 149 API. Typical samples were: SHALE: Black, dark brown, ﬁrm to hard, compacted, carbonaceous, heavy dark oil staining, trace dolomite, even dull green ﬂuorescence, slow streaming cut. <br/>Three Forks 11,078’ MD 10, 743’ TVD -8,596’ SS <br/>The Three Forks formation was picked at 11,078’ MD, 10,743’ TVD picked 19 feet higher than the prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and gamma ray. Background gas ranged from 28—1 18 units with average of 68 units, ROP averaged 0.83 minutes per foot with a range from 042—147 minutes per foot. Gamma showed a range of 49—88 API with an average of 67 API. Typical samples were: DOLOSTONE: Light teal gray, orange tan, light brown, dark gray, dark gray, pinkish, trace siltstone, soﬁ to semi-ﬁrm, argillaceous, slightly calcareous, slightly carbonaceous, dolomitic, chalky to fair induration, fair intercrystalline porosity, scattered yellow green to blue green ﬂuorescence, slow fair milky cut. The curve reached TD of MD 11150 / INC 90.00 / AZ 19250 / TVD 10751.05 / VS 659.18 at 5:00 AM MST on December 31, 2014. After casing was set at 11,137’ MD, the rig moved to next well to complete Lateral at a later date <br/>Lateral #1 11,150’ MD —— 20,309’ MD <br/>DRILLING <br/>Drilling of the lateral began at 10:10 PM MST January 25, 2015. The plan for the lateral was to target 7’-14’ below the top of the base of the Three Forks formation. Coming out of the shoe, the initial formation dip was projected at ~90.3 degrees and ~185_37 degrees azimuth. From the shoe to 12,000’ MD dip was held at 9015 degrees while dip calculations were made based off gamma markers in the Three Forks formation. Aﬁer drilling out of the shoe the bit tracked from the E marker to the middle </p>

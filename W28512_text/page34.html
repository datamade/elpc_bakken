The Britt 151-102-4-9-3H was spudded on July 16, 2014 with surface drilled and cased to be resumed at a later date. Patterson 320 spudded the Britt 151-102-4-9-3H on August 11, 2014 and reached a total depth of 20,633’ MD on September 22, 2014. Wellsite geological services began at 9,200 on August 14, 2014 at 3:50 PM MST. The initial phase of the Britt 151-102-4-9-3H is a vertical and curve landing in the Middle Bakken Formation on August 16, 2014. The single lateral well targeting the Middle Bakken Formation approximately 11’-15’ below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale was started on September 18, 2014. Thirty-foot samples were collected throughout the vertical and curve with ﬁfty foot samples collected in the lateral. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 9,200’ — 10,400’ MD </p>

Gas detection system was tested before logging depth with system functioning correctly. Drill rates before encountering the Base Last Salt ranged from 0.37-0.8 minutes per foot and averaging 0.48 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 118-168 units averaging 140 units. A typical sample was: LIMESTONE: Light gray, gray, dark gray, brown, tan, cream, crypto-crystalline, argillaceous, carbonaceous, moderate to well induration, dolomitic, poor inter-granular porosity, anhydrite, pale yellow ﬂuorescence, slow streaming milky cut. <br/>Base of Last Salt 9,330’ MD 9,325 ’ TVD - 7,031 ’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was picked 1 foot lower than prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and differential pressure. Drill rates below the Base of the Last Salt ranged from 0.37—2.87 minutes per foot with average penetration rate of 0.54 minutes per foot. Gas ranged between 112-236 units averaging 164 units. A typical sample was: LIMESTONE: Light gray, gray, dark gray, white, tan, cream, brown, crypto-crystalline, carbonaceous, soft and patsy, argillaceous, dolomitic, fair induration, poor to no inter-granular porosity, anhydrite, trace dead—dry oil stain, even spotted gold ﬂuorescence, slow thin streaming cut. </p>

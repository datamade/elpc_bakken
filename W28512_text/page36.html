    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Middle Bakken 11,1 79 ’ MD 1 0, 86 7’ TVD -8,5 73 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken formation was picked at 11,179’ MD, 10,867’ TVD picked at the same depth as the prognosis, based on sample changes, ROP, and gamma ray. Background gas ranged from 17—4131 units with average of 1503 units. ROP averaged 0.64 minutes per foot with a range from 018—107 minutes per foot. Gamma showed a range of 45—81 API with an average of 56 API. Typical samples were: SANDSTONE: Gray, gray brown to tan gray, subangular to subrounded, argillaceous, fair sorting, calcareOus, dolomitic, fair inter-granular porosity, light brown oil staining, patchy yellow-green ﬂuorescence, fast streaming broad cut. The curve reached TD of MD 11292 /INC 89.00 / AZ 177.00 / TVD 10876.54 / VS 731.26 at 6:30 PM MST on August 16, 2014. After casing was set at 11,253’ MD, the rig moved to next well on pad and Lateral was resumed at a later date. <br/>Lateral #1 11,292’ MD —- 20,633 ’ MD <br/>DRILLING <br/>Drilling of the lateral began at 12:00 PM MST September 18, 2014. The plan for the lateral was to target 1 1’—15’ below the bottom of the base of the Upper Bakken Shale. Coming out of the shoe, the initial formation dip was projected at ~90.0 degrees and ~178.51 degrees azimuth. From the shoe to 12,000’ MD dip was held at 90.0 degrees while dip calculatious were made based off gamma markers in the Middle Bakken formation. After drilling out of the shoe the bit worked its way up to the Upper half of formation. Slides were preformed to bring bit back down below the Ratty gamma marker. At 12,000’ MD Dip was changed to 90.55 degrees while bit tracked below the Ratty gamma marker for the next 1,000’ MD. At 13,000’ MD Dip was changed to 90.6 degrees while bit continued tracking from the Lower half of formation to just below the Ratty gamma marker for the next 3,500’ MD. At 16,500’ MD the dip was changed to 90.1 degrees for the next 500’ of MD after the bit tracked from the Ratty to the Cool gamma markers in the Middle Bakken. At 17,000’ MD the dip was changed to 90.0 degrees for the next 1,500’ of MD after gamma markers showed the bit tracking from the Lower half to just below the Cool gamma marker in the Middle Bakken formation. At 18,500’ MD formation started showing a downward trend with dip changing to 89.80 degrees for the remainder of the well while the bit tracked from the lower half to the Upper half of the Middle Bakken formation. At 19,253’ MD a trip was preformed to change out BHA due to inadequate build rates on September 21, 2014 at 2:30 PM MST. Once BHA was changed out and bottom was reached 5000—7800 units of trip gas were circulated out with a 10-30 foot ﬂare observed. Lateral was resumed at 5: 15 AM MST on September 22, 2014. The Britt 151-102-4-9-3H Lateral reached a total depth of 20,633’ MD on September 22, 2014 at 11:25 PM MST. Drilling rates in the Middle Bakken formation ranged from 003—166 minutes per foot with an average of 0.41 minutes per foot. The bottom hole location was projected at MD 20633 / INC 89.00 / AZ 183.60 / TVD 10846.27 / VS 10066.33. </p>

    <p class="styleSans25.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">microcrystalline, platy, calcareous cementation, siliceous cementation, dolomitic, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, trace pyrite, dull blue white ﬂuorescence, slow streaming white yellow cloudy cut. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The SC-Gene-154-98-0805H-2 was drilled as a north Middle Bakken lateral in the Truax ﬁeld. As the structure map indicated and past wells in the area had shown, formation dip was expected to change several times throughout the entire lateral. Dip was expected to be mostly ﬂat through the beginning portion of the lateral and then transition to a toe-up through the middle <br/>portion, while the last few hundred feet were expected to be ﬂat. <br/>Gamma signature and correlations were fair to begin and target was adjusted several times through the middle portion of the lateral. Formation clip was estimated at 90.2 to 90.3 degrees. Correlations remained difficult for much of the well. Even though formation dip changed several times throughout the lateral, overall wellbore position was estimated to be near the center of the geologic zone of interest for the majority of the lateral. <br/>Lithology made several color transitions as wellbore moved down, through the zone and then back up into geologic zone. Samples typically showed light gray to light gray brown dolomitic siltstone with dull blue yellow ﬂuorescence and a slow weak cut. Through most of the lateral, total gas typically averaged around 300 — 800 units with increases at connections. Well was drilled at an average target inclination of 90.26 degrees with average formation dip estimated at 90.3 degrees for the entire lateral. </p>

We found a good spot in the formation to drill and we were able to sustain a high rate of penetration. Gamma was from between 55 to 90 API units. Gas was between 250 to 1,200 units with increases over 10,000 units for connections. Samples did not change much and were typically; SILTSTONE: Medium gray, gray, light gray, cream gray, off white, dark gray, gray brown, microcrystalline, platy, calcareous cementation, dolomitic, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, dull blue white ﬂuorescence, slow weak yellow cloudy cut. <br/>Continuing to drill ahead past 17000 to 18,000’ MD the well bore started in the upper half of the target window. When targets were raised 4’ TVD and inclination changed to 90.5 degrees at 17,484’ MD or 6,000’ VS the well bore was drilled in the lower half of the target window. Penetration rates were from 200 to 350 feet per hour. Gamma was in the range of 60 to 90 API units. Gas was from 150 to 500 units, with increases over 10,000 units for connections. Samples did not change much and were; SILTSTONE: Gray, medium gray, light gray, cream gray, brown, dark gray, cream, white, off white, microcrystalline, platy, calcareous cementation, dolomitic, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, dull blue white ﬂuorescence, slow weak white blue cloudy cut. Enviro-Torq used to minimize torque and anti—foam agents, altered any potential oil shows. <br/>Continuing to drill ahead past 18,000” MD to 19,000’ MD the wellbore was drilled in the lower half of the target window. It was thought the formation was ﬂattening slightly. At 18,993’ MD or 7,500’ VS, targets were raised 3’ TVD and inclination was changed to 90.3 degrees. Rates of penetration were from 150 to 350 feet per hour. Gamma was in the range of 50 to 90 APl units. Gas was from 100 to 400 units with increases for connections. The typical sample was; SILTSTONE: Medium gray, light gray brown, light gray, gray, cream gray, off white, dark gray, gray brown, microcrystalline, platy, calcareous cementation, dolomitic, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, dull scattered blue white ﬂuorescence, slow streaming yellow cloudy cut. Enviro-Torq and the anti—foam agents used hampered any potential oil shows. <br/>Drilling past 19,000’ MD to 20,000’ MD the wellbore remained at the bottom of the target window suggesting well was at approximate dip of formation. Several slides were made in order to move towards the center of the window, but inclination consistently fell below 90.0 degrees. Correlations suggested fonnation was now showing signs of ﬂattening. Penetration rates were from 150 to 320 feet per hour. Gamma stayed between 50 and 90 API units. Gas was ﬁom 75 to 400 units with increases for connection gas. Samples continued to Show; SILTSTONE: Medium gray, light gray brown, light gray, gray, off white, dark gray, gray brown, white, microcrystalline, platy, calcareous cementation, dolomitic, moderate induration, friable, poor intergranular porosity, dull blue ﬂuorescence, slow weak yellow white cloudy cut. Heavy use of Enviro-Torq used to minimize torque and anti-foam agents, altered any potential oil shows, and also made samples difﬁcult to recover. <br/>Continuing to drill from 20,000’ MD to 21,226’ MD of lateral, we tripped out of the well at 20,439’ MD due to a mud motor failure. At 20,504’ MD we lowered targets 2’ TVD and changed the inclination to 90.0 degrees. Penetration rates continued to stay between 250 e 300 ft/hr. Gamma was between 50 to 90 APl units. Total gas was between 200 — 400 units with increases at connections. Final depth of the Middle Bakken lateral was reached at 21 ,290’ MD on March 6th, 2015 at 7:30 pm CST. A projection to bit showed wellbore ﬁnished approximately 18.4’ below the center of the drilling window. The typical sample in this interval was; <br/>SILTSTONE: Medium gray, light gray brown, light gray, cream gray, off white, dark gray, </p>

Background gas ranged from 157—7408 units with average of 2277 units. ROP averaged 0.69 minutes per foot with a range from 0.35—2.22 minutes per foot. Gamma showed a range of 40—78 API with an average of 58 API. Typical samples were: SANDSTONE: Gray to brown gray, dark gray, tan gray, subangular to subrounded, moderately argillaceous, fair sorting, fair calcareous/dolomitic cementation, fair intergranular porosity, fair brown oil staining, even yellow green ﬂuorescence, fair milky cut.

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">DRILLING <br/>Drilling of the lateral began at 1:55 AM MST September 11, 2014. The plan for the lateral was to target 11’-15’ below the bottom of the base of the Upper Bakken Shale. Coming out of the shoe, the initial formation dip was projected at ~90.3 degrees and ~181.64 degrees azimuth. From the shoe to 12,000’ MD dip was held at 90.3 degrees while dip calculations were made based off gamma markers in the Middle Bakken formation. At 12,000’ MD Dip was changed to 90.35 degrees while bit tracked between the Lower half of formation to the Cool gamma marker for the next 2,000’ MD. At 14,000’ MD Dip was changed to 90.4 degrees while bit tracked from the Cool to Ratty gamma markers in the Middle Bakken formation for the next 1,000’ MD. At 15,000’ MD the dip was changed to 90.45 degrees for the next 1,500’ of MD after the bit tracked from the Cool to Ratty gamma markers in the Middle Bakken. At 16,500’ MD the dip was changed to 90.3 degrees for the next 1,000’ of MD while the bit tracked the Ratty gamma marker. At 17,500’ MD formation started showing a downward trend with dip changing to 89.9 degrees for the next 1,000’ of MD while the bit tracked from the Ratty to cool gamma marker in the Middle Bakken formation. At 18,500’ NH) the dip was changed to 89.4 degrees for the next 1,000’ of MD while the bit was worked back below the Cool gamma marker to the Lower half of formation. At 19,500’ MD the dip was changed to 89.8 degrees for the remainder of the lateral while the bit was worked from the Lower half to the Ratty gamma marker in the Middle Bakken formation. At 20,434’ MD a trip was preformed to change out BHA due to Mud Motor failure on September 15, 2014 at 11:50 PM MST. Once BHA was changed out and bottom was reached 1000-3000 units of trip gas were circulated out with a 15-35 foot ﬂare observed. Lateral was resumed at 3 :05 PM MST on September 15, 2014. The Britt 151-102-4—9-2H Lateral reached a total depth of 20,748’ MD on September 15, 2014 at 5:45 PM MST. Drilling rates in the Middle Bakken formation ranged from 0.03e60.8 minutes per foot with an average of 0.39 minutes per foot. The bottom hole location was projected at MD 20748 / INC 89.10 / AZ 178.50 / TVD 10859.82 / VS 10065.14. </p>

It was spudded on 26 Dec 2014. Total depth of20,557' IVID; 10,400.33' TVD; 10,138.18' VS reached at 0920 hrs MST 07 <br/>Jan 2015. <br/>Meredith Remmich, Alan Chappell of Neset Consulting Service, Inc. provided geological services from a measure depth of 7,450’. One set of samples was collected in thirty foot intervals for the vertical and curve, and in one hundred foot intervals during the lateral. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Pason Gas <br/>Detection was utilized for gas detection. <br/>VERTICAL / CURVE WE'LLBORES 7,450’ — 10, 760’ MD </p>

TOOH due to low ROP from 8,096' MD at 0100 hrs MST 30 Dec 2014; resumed drilling vertical wellbore at 1020 hrs MST 30 Dec 2014. TOOH for curve assembly from 9,818' IVID at 0915 hrs MST 31 Dec 2014; resumed drilling at 2020 hrs MST 31 Dec 2014 and began building the curve at 9,828’ MD at 9,824’ TVD. The target was set at 10,3 83’ TVD, 10’ into the Middle Bakken. Curve ROP averaged 1.0 min/ﬂ (60 feet per hour) and total gas averaged 150 units with a peak recorded reading of 1270 units. The Middle Bakken TVD target window was established as an 8’ window, with the target top 5’ below the Upper Bakken Shale and the target bottom 7’above the Lower <br/>Bakken Shale, with a total Middle Bakken Member thickness estimated at 20’. 7” casing was set at 10,750’ MD and cemented. <br/>F ORMA T IONS Tyler 7,526 ’ MD 7,523’ T VD -5, 604’ SS <br/>The Tyler Formation was observed at 7,526’ MD (7,523’ TVD; -5,604’ SS), 18’ higher than the prognosis. The Tyler top was identiﬁed by GR signature and rate of penetration (ROP). ROP averaged 0.6 minutes per foot (100 feet/hour). There were no signiﬁcant gas recordings. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Tyler Formation. </p>

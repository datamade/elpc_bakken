Total ROP in the Middle Bakken (curve and lateral) averaged 0.7 minutes per foot. Background gas aveaged 650 units in the Middle Bakken with no signiﬁcant gas peak. No unexpected hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Middle Bakken Member. <br/>A representative sample: <br/>DOLOMITE: Light brownish gray, light brown, light gray, microcrystalline, arenaceous, silty, calcareous, microsucrosic, platy in part w/trace laminations, moderate induration, poor intercrystalline porosity, scattered pale greenish yellow ﬂuorescence, moderately rapid streaming foggy greenish yellow cut. <br/>LATERAL WELLBORE 10,760’MD ~20,557’ MD <br/>Drilled out of casing at 1450 hrs 03 Jan 2015 and began tracking the target window at 90.0 to 90.2 degrees in the lower half of the target window. Background gas through the ﬁrst part of the lateral averaged 150 to 200 units. With samples being mainly DOLOMITE: Light brownish gray, medium brown, trace very light gray, microcrystalline, arenaceous, silty, calcareous, microsucrosic, platy in part (light w/dark laminations), moderate induration, poor intercrystalline porosity, even dull greenish yellow ﬂuorescence, rapid streaming cloudy dull greenish yellow cut. At 11700’ MD the bit began building up from the bottom of the target window to the upper half of the target window. Once we had the bit pointed back down we were able to calculate a dip of 90.2 degrees. At this point we let the bit driﬂ back up towards the top of the target window and took a deﬂection down at 13100’ MD and 13600’ MD. Then there was a decision made to drop down to see the D facies. The bit encountered the D facies at 14000’ MD and we had average background gas of 200 to 250 units through this part of the lateral. Samples description through this part of the lateral were DOLOMITE: Medium grayish brown, medium brown, microcrystalline, silty, arenaceous, slightly calcareous, microsucrosic, platy in pan (tan gray w/no laminations), moderate induration, poor intercrystalline porosity, rare massive pyrite, scattered dull greenish yellow ﬂuorescence, rapid cloudy pale yellow cut. The bit stayed in the D facies until 16800’ MD and we moved back up into the target window. Then the bit drifted to the top half of the target window and tracked formation dip until 17800’ l\/ID at this point it was determined that the formation dip changed to a 8989.5 to 89.6 degrees. Then we dropped to the bottom of the target window once again and it was determined that the formation dip had changed to 90.0 degrees. Then the bit built up and we got back to the top of the target window at 18900’ MD and we began to track the formation dip again at 89.6 degrees. Samples through this last part of the lateral were DOLOMITE: Medium brown, light brown, light brownish gray, microcrystalline, very arenaceous, silty, calcareous, microsucrosic, platy in part (trace staining) moderate induration, fair intercrystalline porosity; scattered unconsolidated quartz sand; even dull yellow ﬂuorescence, instant streaming cloudy dull greenish yellow cut. Then there was a decision to move down into the lower part of the target window and we dropped down through the target window and <br/>6 </p>

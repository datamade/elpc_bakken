The meter factor will represent the most recent valid meter factor based on quarterly master meter or tank proving <br/>8. Measured daily well LACI' volume will be the measured oil volume that is delivered to the commingled LACI', as recorded by the dedicated well coriolis meter, times the meter factor. Measurement will be done continuously. Meter data will be stored and archived. <br/>9. Measured monthly well LACT volumes will represent the sum of the prior months measured daily well LACT volumes. <br/>10. The measured monthly pad LACT volume will represent the sum of the measured monthly well LACT volumes from each well on the pad. <br/>11. The custody transfer pad LACT volume will represent the actual volume sold through a LACT as measured by the LACT metering and sampling system. <br/>12. The monthly well LACT sales volume will be calculated by multiplying the custody transfer pad LACT volume times the measured monthly well LACT volume divided by the measured monthly pad LACT volume. <br/>After LACT installation, the water volume per well will be calculated as follows: <br/>1. The meter factor will represent the most recent valid meter factor based on quarterly master meter proving. <br/>2. Measured daily well volume will be the measured water volume that is delivered to the commingled tank battery, as recorded by the dedicated well meter, times the meter factor.

The measured monthly pad volume will represent the sum of the measured monthly well volumes from each well on the pad. <br/>5. The custody transfer pad volume will represant the sum of the actual volume transferred through a LACT as measured by the LACT metering system. <br/>6. The monthly well expense volume will be calculated by multiplying the custody transfer pad <br/>volume times the measured monthly well volume divided by the measured monthly pad volume. <br/>7. Well expense will be calculated based on the monthly well expense volume. </p>

At 13,300’ MD the dip was changed to 90.0 degrees for the next 1,200’ of MD while the bit tracked the center of the target window in the Three Forks formation. At 14,500’ MD the dip was changed to 89.8 degrees for the next 1,500’ of MD aﬁer gamma markers showed the bit tracking from the top to the base of the target window in the Three Forks formation. At 16,000’ MD the dip was changed to 90.0 degrees for the next 2,000’ of MD aﬁer gamma markers showed the bit tracking from the top of the target window to just below the F marker in the Three Forks formation. At 16,020’ MD a trip was preformed to change out BHA due to slow penetration rates on January 13, 2015 at 10:00 AM MST. Once BHA was changed out and bottom was reached 120—240 units of trip gas were circulated out. Lateral was resumed at 11:20 PM MST on January 14, 2015. While continuing to drill lateral it was observed that the gamma signature had been very erratic since last trip. At 17,490’ MD a trip was preformed to change out MWD tool due to gamma signature on January 14, 2015 at 8: 10 PM MST. Once MWD tool was changed out and tripped back in, the decision was made to re-log gamma from 16,020’ MD to 17,490’ MD. Once ﬁnished the lateral was resumed at 5:50 AM MST on January 16, 2015. The bit drifted below the F marker from 17,400 to 18,000’ MD with slides preformed to work it back into the target window. At 18,000’ MD the dip was changed to 89.7 degrees for the next 1,000’ of MD aﬁer gamma markers showed the bit being worked back above the E marker to the top of formation. At 19,000’ MD the dip was changed to 89.9 degrees for the next 500’ of MD while the bit tracked from the top of formation to center of the target window in the Three Forks formation. At 19,193’ MD a trip was preformed to change out BHA due to inadequate build rates and close proximity to the top of the Three Forks formation on January 17, 2015 at 6:00 PM MST, Once BHA was changed out and bottom was reached 150-230 units of trip gas were circulated out. Lateral was resumed at 11:30 AM MST on January 18, 2015, with slides preformed to work the bit back into the target window. At 19,500’ MD the dip was changed to 90.0 degrees for the remainder of the well while the bit tracked from the center of the target window to just below the F marker in the Three Forks formation. The State 154—102-25-3 6-9TFH Lateral reached a total depth of 20,328’ MD on January 19, 2015 at 11:00 AM MST. Drilling rates in the Three Forks formation ranged from 0.02—1147 minutes per foot with an average of 0.64 minutes per foot. The bottom hole location was projected at MD 20281 / INC 87.00 / AZ 180.50 / TVD 10770.21 IVS 9687.10 </p>

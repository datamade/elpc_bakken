Background gas ranged from 28-320 units with average showing 119 units. Drilling rates in the Lower Bakken Shale ranged from 018—322 minutes per foot with an average of 0.67 minutes per foot. Gamma ranged from 84-255 API with an average of 129 API.

The curve reached TD of MD 11127 / INC 8850 / AZ <br/>16370 / TVD 10750.72 / VS 552.69 at 4:40 PM MST on January 7, 2015. After casing was set at 11,004’ MD, the rig prepared to begin Lateral. <br/>Lateral #1 1 1,12 7’ MD — 20,328 ’ MD <br/>DRILLING <br/>Drilling of the lateral began at 11:45 PM MST January 9, 2015. The plan for the lateral was to target 7’-14’ below the top of the base of the Three Forks formation. Coming out of the shoe, the initial formation dip was projected at ~90.3 degrees and ~178.42 degrees azimuth. From the shoe to 12,200’ MD dip was held at 90.3 degrees while dip calculations were made based off gamma markers in the Three Forks formation. Aﬁer drilling out of the shoe the bit worked its way up to the top of the target window in formation. At 12,200’ MD Dip was changed to 9065 degrees while bit tracked from the top of the target window to the F marker for the next 500’ MD, At </p>

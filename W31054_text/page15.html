Planning: Oasis has invested a great deal of time and energy in the development plan for 2015/2016 — with a special focus on efficiency. The rig count in the area requires a certain number of pads to yield an optimum pace of development for the corridor. Three AndersMadson pads are needed to accommodate the planned rig schedule. <br/>Flooding concerns: Oasis has committed to raising the pad an additional 2’, with a 3’ dike, to alleviate any concerns regarding high water in the area. This will bring the perimeter elevation of the pad to 5’. <br/>Included are two photographs that illustrate the flooding potential of the AndersMadson well pad in an extreme flooding scenario. The photos show where the water line would be in relation to the proposed top of dike elevation. <br/>The photos show a water elevation 1884’. Oasis will elevate the pad surface to 1882’, with a top of dike elevation of 1885’. In the event of a reoccurrence of extreme flooding, the pad would still be protected to an elevation that would inundate the surrounding area. As this area is 10’ higher than Co. Road 29, discharge to Lake Sakakawea would be inevitable. <br/>SWPPP & SPCC: The location will be compliant with storm water pollution prevention plan requirements during all phases of construction, drilling, completions and production. Consistent with SWPPP best practices, drainage will be re-routed around the location. Erosion controls will be employed, as appropriate, around the site to reduce erosion and the resulting sediment contamination to freshwater runoff during weather events. The location will be subject to a flood contingency plan similar to the one provided for the Harrier location. Finally, an SPCC plan will be submitted within 6 months of the last well on the pad being drilled. </p>

The final location of the CTB will be on a site with a higher elevation or on a currently existing pad, at the discretion of the NDIC. The existing Leanne pad to the west is the probable <br/>location for the AndersMadson CTB. </p>

Roggenbuck 34—24—2H is a Middle Bakken well located in the SWSE of Section 24 T153N R93W in Mountrail County, North Dakota. The initial phase of the Roggenbuck 34-24-2H is a vertical and curve, landing thirteen feet into the Middle Bakken. It was then re-entered as a single lateral well in the Middle Bakken. The Roggenbuck 34-24-2H spudded March 5, 2015 and reached a total depth of <br/>18,670’ MD on March 18, 2015. </p>

Thirty foot lagged samples were collected. All samples were washed, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota and at Whiting Oil and Gas Corp. in Denver, Colorado. <br/>Vertical 8, 750’ — 9,980’ MD <br/>Drill rates averaged 113 minute per foot throughout the vertical section. Gas averaged 196 units. <br/>Base Last Salt 8,898 ’ MD 8,89 7’ TVD -6, 665 ’ SS <br/>The Base of the Last Salt was encountered at 8,897 ’ TVD. Base of the Last Salt was picked by last sample with salt present, and the gamma marker. ROP averaged .87 min/ﬁ. Gas averaged 171 units. Typical samples were: <br/>LIMESTONE: Gray tan, light gray, gray brown, cream gray tan, ﬁrm to hard, tight, micro to ﬁnely grained, fragmental, slightly argillaceous, trace anhydrite, no to poor intergranular porosity, spotty dull yellow ﬂuorescence, slow faint cloudy yellow cut. <br/>Mission Canyon 9,075 ’ MD 9,074 ’ TVD -6, 842 ’ SS <br/>Mission Canyon was picked from lithology change and the gamma marker. ROP averaged 1.17 minutes a foot. Gas averaged 212 units. Typical samples were: <br/>LIMESTONE: Light tan to medium tan. light brown, cream to cream tan, light to medium gray, ﬁrm to hard, microcrystalline, moderately argillaceous, scattered dark gray laminations, trace anhydrite, little to no interganular porosity, scattered dull yellow ﬂuorescence, weak cloudy fast streaming cut. <br/>We had to TOOH at 9,670’ MD at 4:30 am on Mar. 10 to change out tools. We got back to bottom and resumed drilling at 1:30 pm that same day. </p>

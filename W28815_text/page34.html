    <p class="styleSans496.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">The divert oil tanks, labeled on the Process Flow Diagram, are intended to receive diverted oil from the LACT units. The LACT units will not open the divert vale to ship down the pipeline until a valid BS&W (Basic Sediment & Water) signal is received from the skid oil sampler. Because of this delay, a discrete amount of oil will always flow away from the LACT skids, even though the oil is of pipeline quality. In these routine diversions, the oil is immediately re- introduced back into the suction header, where the oil is sold across the custody transfer meter without being metered twice by an allocation meter. The divert tanks are plumbed in parallel to allow for the LACTs to divert to one tank while the other tank re-delivers its oil. <br/>However, in the circumstance of oil that truly fails to meet the pipeline specifications, the oil must be returned to the beginning of the battery process flow for re—treatment. This re-treatment is intended to remove <br/>whatever contaminants were carried through the treater into the well's dedicated tanks. Since this oil is being re-routed back to a point upstream of the allocation meters, and will thus be metered twice, knowledge ofthe oil and water volumes in the divert tank is required to ensure accurate subtraction from the allocation meters. <br/>The divert tanks are to be installed with tank gauges that contain an oil/water interfacial float. The divert tanks will not be pumped off to re-treatment until such time has allowed the liquid phases to separate and form the interface from which the interfacial height, along with the overall liquid column height, can be determined. Respective oil and water volumes are then calculated based on tank diameter. As a redundant backup to this method, an initial divert oil liquid height can be gauged, the recycle pump started, and a tank height re—gauged when oil enters the recycle pump. By subtracting the two liquid heights minus the volume of the suction piping to the recycle pump, the volume of the water and a volume ofthe oil can be determined manually. <br/>Given that the battery’s oil is commingled downstream of the allocation meters, any sub-grade oil passing through the allocation meters will presumably contaminate any oils in the suction header at that time. The total volume of sub-grade oil, therefore, is greater than the volume of oil that has contaminated the batch. in other words, the volume of oil in the divert tank will be greater than the sub-grade oil from the individual treater that contaminated the batch. For this reason, the divert oil must be allocated to all of the wells in production at that time, based on percentage comparisons of each well’s production. Although the allocation meters have the Capability to monitor fluid conditions (e.g., density and gravity) simply allocating all of the divert oil to the well that delivered the sub-grade fluid would not be accurate. <br/>  </p>

ND <br/>The samples that were very saturated with envirotorque caused very poor sample quality and therefore the accuracy of sample descriptions was compromised. The geologist and mudlogger attempted to wash the envirotorque from the samples using soap and citra-solve but the envirotorque could not be washed away. We had dull- bright yellow hydrocarbon ﬂuorescence in the samples between 5%- 60% until the samples became saturated with envirotorque. We had weak to fair slow to immediate slightly too moderately bright blue/white difﬁlse cuts. Ronsonol was used to cut samples and then View under a UV ﬂuoroscope. <br/>4.1 Oil Shows <br/>At the possum belly, we had between trace to 10% light to dark green/yellow to dark green/brown oil when they began adding envirotorque. <br/>4.2 Gas Shows <br/>The background gas from when we drilled out of the 7” intermediate casing at 11492’ MD to a trip at 13611’ MD averaged between 150 units to 575 units. After the trip at 13611 MD, we began going thru the gas buster and our background gas averaged between 125 units to 525 units and gradually increased to TD of 20560’ MD. A trip at 13611’ MD, due to a motor failure, produced 287 units of trip gas thru the gas buster with a 2’- 3’ gas ﬂare; a trip at 13691 ’ MD, due to a MWD tool failure (gamma probe), produced 340 units of trip gas thru the gas buster with a 2’- 4’ gas ﬂare; a trip at 16931’ MD, due to a motor failure, produced 502 units of trip gas thru the gas buster (there was no ﬂare because the igniter was not working); a trip at 18865’ MD due to a motor failure, produced 842 units of trip gas thru the gas buster with a 6’- 12’ gas ﬂare; a trip at 19555’ MD, due to a MWD tool failure (gamma probe); produced 880 units of trip gas thru the gas buster with a 5’- 15’ gas ﬂare and a trip at 19555’ MD, due to a MWD tool failure (pulser), produced 652 units of trip gas thru the gas buster with a 5’- 10’ gas ﬂare. While going thru the gas buster we only saw a barely lit ﬂare to almost 2’ gas ﬂare and this was only during some connections. The mud weight for the lateral was between 9.8 and 10.0+. At TD, the bottoms up gas was 630 units. A chart showing the cross section of the wellbore with the rop, gas, gamma ray, oil shows and mud weight data can be found in Figure 1. <br/>PAGE18 </p>

A ultra sonic CBL was run on 03/25/2015. Based upon the results of the CBL it was determined in conversation with the NDIC that a squeeze job would not be efficient because of the cement that the CBL did show. Because of the lack of cement across the salt section of the wellbore the NDIC agreed to allow SM Energy to run a produciton tie-back string in the well to add mechanical strength to that portion of the wellbore. The well was then placed on artifical lift. The tie-back string was run on 03/31/2015. The 7" x 5 1/2" production tie-back annulus will be pressure monitored. At the time the well is P&A'd the <br/>production tie-back string will be pulled. <br/>Redrilling or Repair <br/>Casing or Liner <br/>Plug Well E] Fracture Treatment Supplemental History E] Change Production Method Temporarily Abandon E] Reclamation <br/>Other unired CBL and production tie-back string <br/>    <br/>24-HOUR PRODUCTION RATE <br/>              <br/>      <br/>   <br/>           <br/>        <br/>     <br/>  <br/>  <br/>Company Telephone Number SM Ener y Company (406 245-6248 FOR STATE USE ONLY Address . °  59103 I 2WD l <br/>       <br/>            <br/>Stephen Bri - gs Production Engineer April 30, 2015 <br/>Email Address sbriggs m-energ .com <br/>By A TIEROLEUM meme - <br/>      </p>

    <p class="styleSans11.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">the entire target window. Two off-set wells (Holst 1-33H and J eriyote 4-32-5TFH) were used for isopaching the curve landing target. Holst 1-33H was used as the primary off-set well as it was drilled on the same pad. Due to the curve landing into an up-dip with a large curve radius, 2’ of structural rise was expected. The original target of 10,076 was raised 4’ early in the curve because markers were suggesting a slightly higher target and accounting for the anticipated 2’ structural rise. The target was later raised by another 4’ after the Upper Bakken was encountered at a shallower depth than expected. With markers coming in at signiﬁcantly higher depths, a thick packstone or shoal was expected to be encountered in the Middle Bakken. Once the wellbore moved into the Middle Bakken the Hot Gamma Markers was encountered just 4’ into the formation and, as expected, a shoal was present. Sincc shoals in the area are so unpredictable, the target window was changed so that the base of the shoal was the target center which allowed for 6’ of target window below the shoal rather than just 1’. The change in the target window gave an ideal target (target base) of 10,066’ TVD. When the curve reached 90° it was just 1’ above the target at 10,065 ’ TVD. After reaching 90° an additional 400’ was drilled to extend the wellbore past the <br/>500’ setback in section 33. Drilling stopped at 10,772’ MD at 2:15 pm CDT on September 2, 2014 and 7” casing was run. <br/>Upper Bakken 1 0,144 ’ MD 1 0,028 ’ T VD -8,122 ’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was encountered at 10,144’ measured depth and 10,028’ true vertical depth. The isochore thickness of the shale was found to be 18’ during the curve. The thin Upper Bakken Shale was likely the result of landing into a steep up- dip and the presence of an 11’ thick underlying packstone. The drilling rate increased from about 44fph to 71fph as the bit entered the shale. Formation gas increased immediately while encountering the Upper Bakken with a surge in formation gas reaching 1,751 units. Formation gas averaged 727 units. Samples from the Upper Bakken were described as a black to brown black, organic rich, blocky shale with very dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a strong milky blue white blooming cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 10,196 ’ MD 10,046 ’ T VD -8,140’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at 10,196’ MD and a TVD of 10,046’. Upon drilling into the Middle Bakken, ROP slowed to an average of 39fph and formation gas dropped to an average of 400 units. The ﬁrst sample from the Middle Bakken was described as an argillaceous dolomitic siltstone. Particle size and oil shows increased once the middle and lower Middle Bakken were encountered. Formation gas and oil shows were relatively good below the Hot Gamma Marker. Upon drilling into the target window an 11’ thick packstone (shoal) was encountered. Samples were generally described as a gray tan silty and dolomitic sandstone with milky diffuse to slightly streaming cuts. Samples from the top of the target window showed more prevalent calcitic cement than underlying stratum. The bottom half of the target window was softer, more argillaceous, and interbedded siltstone was more common. The curve segment was completed at 2: 15 pm CDT on September 2, 2014 at 10,772’ MD. <br/>Lateral #1 NENE 10,761 — 13,534 ’MD <br/>The NENE lateral or ﬁrst lateral began after drilling through 7” casing with a 6” NOV DSSl6M type bit at 10,761 ’ MD and then entering open formation. The drilling ﬂuid remained oil based mud for the lateral. Targets were initially projected ahead with an angle of dip of 906° which then slowly transition into a steeper angle of dip near 908° as the wellbore’s azimuth turned east, towards the true dip of the formation. </p>

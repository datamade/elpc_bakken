This depth was determined by drilling signatures and analysis of samples. Above the Last Salt, the Greenpoint Anhydrite showed distinctive slower drilling which was useful in determining stratigraphic position. ROP through the last salt bench averaged lOOfph. <br/>The kick off point (KOP) for the curve and a preliminary target for the curve landing were calculated using the depth of the BLS. An estimated isopach thickness of 1,642’ from the BLS to the expected Middle Bakken target provided a preliminary target of 10,07 6’ TVD and the planned curve radius of 477’ provided a KOP of 9,5 99’ TVD (actual KOP was last kelly down before the calculated depth). The calculations were based on landing the curve at the target base. <br/>Mission Canyon 8,646 ’ MD 8,644 ’ T VD -6, 753’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon Formation was seen at 8,646’ MD. Its depth was estimated from drilling signatures. Subtle changes in lithology were also useﬁil in determining the depth of the Mission Canyon. ROP in the formation averaged 69fph while formation gas averaged 160 units. The highest gas readings were detected high in the formation directly below the impermeable anhydrite units. Near the top of the formation, samples were less carbonaceous and signiﬁcantly more anhydritic than underlying stratum. The rate of penetration was slightly slower in the anhydrite units. Samples showed subtle changes in clay and carbon content several times before reaching the top of the Lodgepole Formation. <br/>Lodgepole 9,226 ’ MD 9,224 ’ T VD -7,318 ’ SS </p>

The most distinctive change was ratty drilling signatures from leaving the elastic Mission Canyon limestone and entering the more crystalline Lodgepole limestone. It was not only the subtle changes in lithology and drilling rates that deﬁned the formation but also differential pressure, rotary, torque and weight on bit. Drill rates through the formation in the vertical segment averaged 70fph while gas averaged 140units with a range from 107 units to 205 units. Samples often had spotty to patchy yellow green ﬂuorescence with slow blooming to <br/>streaming cuts. Shortly after encountering the Lodgepole, KOP was reached at 11:00 am CDT on August 31, 2014 at a measured depth of 9,581’. <br/>Curve 9,581’ - 10, 772’MD <br/>The curve process began aﬁer tripping out to add an Ulterra U516M type bit, a ﬁxed 2.25° DDC motor and MWD tools. Drilling resumed at 9,581 ’ MD at 12:15 am CDT on September 1, 2014. The original assembly was used for the remainder of the curve and it averaged 43 fph. The lower Lodgepole was found to be more argillaceous, silty, and carbonaceous than the overlying Lodgepole. The best oil shows were also in the lower Lodgepole. During the curve, formation gas within the Lodgepole was near <br/>170 units before encountering a more carbonaceous stratum near the False Bakken where gas averaged close to 600 units. <br/>The depths of Lodgepole and Bakken gamma ray markers were utilized for isopaching the Middle Bakken curve landing target. The calculations were based on landing the curve approximately 19’ into the Middle Bakken at the target base. The target base was preferred for revealing the gamma proﬁle of </p>

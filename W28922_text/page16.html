During the curve, formation gas within the Lodgepole was near 72 units before encountering a more carbonaceous stratum near the False Bakken where gas reached 1,013 units. <br/>The depths of Lodgepole and Bakken gamma ray markers were utilized for isopaching the Three Forks curve landing target. The calculations were based on landing the curve approximately 22’ into the Three Forks Formation at the target center. Two off-set wells, Howo 5-33-4TFH and Howo 8-33-4TF2H were used for isopaching the curve landing target. Both off set wells were drilled on the same pad, but Howo 8-33-4TF2H was the primary well as it is nearer to Howo 4 than Howo 5. A preliminary target of 10,174’ TVD was originally picked based off the Base of the Last Salt’s TVD compared to that of Howo 8’s, which was 4’ lower and an additional estimated 4’ structural difference from Howo 8 to Howo 4. As drilling continued, the Mission Canyon appeared to thicken, resulting in a target change of + 6’ for a TVD of 10,180’. Gamma markers throughout the Lodgepole on average had come in ab0ut the same as Howo 8 and Bakken markers a couple feet higher, suggesting targets to be raised. With an estimated 4’ structural difference still in mind, targets were raised 3’ to 10,177’ TVD which was the last target adjustment The curve landed 1’ higher than planned at a TVD of 10,176' with an inclination of 856° at 7:00 am CDT on November 16, 2014. <br/>Upper Bakken 1 0, 063 ’ 1WD 10, 019 ’ TVD -8,128 ’ SS <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale was encountered at 10,063’ measured depth and 10,019’ true vertical depth. The isochore thickness of the shale was found to be 17’ during the curve. The drilling rate increased from about 34 fph to 37 fph as the bit entered the shale. Formation gas increased immediately before encountering the Upper Bakken with a high of 1,474 units. A sample from the Upper Bakken was described as a Black, brown black, firm to hard, blocky, well compacted, heavily carbonaceous, gritty, very poor porosity, hard, light tan crystalline limestone in part, very dull yellow green ﬂuorescence, strong milky blue white blooming cut. <br/>Middle Bakken 10, 087’ MD 10,051 ’ T VD -8,145 ’ SS <br/>The Middle Bakken was encountered at 10,087 ’ MD and a TVD of 10,051’. Upon drilling into the Middle Bakken, ROP increased to an average of 41 fph and gas dropped to an average of 60 units. Formation gas and oil shows were relatively good in the Middle Bakken. Samples were generally described as a gray tan silty and dolomitic sandstone with milky diffuse cuts. A sample from lower in the target window showed more prevalent calcitic cement than overlying stratum and interbedded siltstone was more common. <br/>Lower Bakken 10,165’ MD 10,102’ TVD -8,196’ SS <br/>The Lower Bakken Shale was encountered at 10,165’ measured depth and 10,102’ true vertical depth. The isochore thickness of the shale was found to be 51’, as expected. The drilling rates increased from 41 fph to 82 fph once the wellbore entered the shale. Formation gas increased slightly after encountering the Lower Bakken with a high of 125 units and an averaged 78 units. Samples from the Lower Bakken were described as a black to brownish black, very </p>

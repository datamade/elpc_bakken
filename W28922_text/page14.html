This depth was determined by drilling signatures and analysis of samples. Above the Last Salt, the Greenpoint Anhydrite showed distinctive slower drilling which was useﬁil in determining stratigraphic position. ROP through the last salt bench averaged 83 fph which slowed to 49 fph and became erratic in underlain limestone and anhydrite units. <br/>The kick off point (KOP) for the curve and a preliminary target for the curve landing were calculated using the depth of the BLS. An estimated isopach thickness of 1,723’ from the BLS to the expected Three Forks target provided a preliminary target of 10,174’ TVD and the planned curve radius of 477’ provided a KOP of 9,697’. The calculations were based on landing the curve at the target center. <br/>Mission Canyon 8,616’ MD 8,615 ’ T VD -6, 709’ SS <br/>The Mission Canyon Formation was seen at 8,616’ MD. Its depth was established due to gamma data from the MWD tool. Subtle changes in lithology and drilling signatures were also useful in establishing the depth of the Mission Canyon. ROP in the formation averaged 43 fph while formation gas averaged 78 units. Near the top of the formation, samples were less carbonaceous and signiﬁcantly more anhydritic than underlying stratum. The rate of penetration was slightly slower in the anhydrite units. Off-set wells showed indications of a more porous interval with signiﬁcant increases in formation gas. Near 8,830’ MD formation gas increased slightly to 89. Samples showed subtle changes in clay and carbon content several times before reaching the top of the Lodgepole Formation <br/>Lodgepole 9,218’ 1WD 9,217’ T VD -7,311 ’ SS <br/>The depth of the Lodgepole Formation was encountered at a MD of 9,218’. As the Lodgepole was encountered, a lithology change from a brown carbonaceous limestone to a predominantly gray crystalline and argillaceous limestone was identiﬁed. The most distinctive change was ratty drilling signatures from leaving the clastic Mission Canyon limestone and entering the more crystalline Lodgepole dolomitic limestone. It was not only ROP and gamma that deﬁned the formation but also differential pressure, rotary, torque and weight on bit. Drill rates through the formation in the vertical segment averaged 42 fph while gas remained relatively invariable at 72 units. Samples often had spotty to patchy yellow green ﬂuorescence with slow blooming to streaming cuts. After tripping out to add a Haliburton MMDS 5M type bit, a ﬁxed 2.5° DDC motor and MWD tools at a measured depth of 9,67 5’, KOP was reached shortly after at 5:45 pm CDT on November 14, 2014 at a measured depth of 9,703’. <br/>Curve 9, 703’ - 10,435’MD The curve process began immediately at 9,703’ MD at 5:45 pm CDT on November 14, <br/>2014. This assembly was used for the remainder of the curve and averaged 42 fph. The lower Lodgepole was found to be more argillaceous, silty, and carbonaceous than the overlying </p>

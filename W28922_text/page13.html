The drilling rig, CanElson #41, began drilling on November 4, 2014 and ceased drilling after the lateral reached a total depth of 20,044’ on November 30, 2014. The bottom hole location is located in the SW‘/4 SW‘A of Section 4 T151N R92W. <br/>Howo 4-33-4TFH landed the curve and drilled laterally within the First Bench of the Three Forks Formation (Late Devonian) within the Williston Basin. The vertical and curve segments were drilled with an 83/4” bit and cased with 7” intermediate casing to a measured depth (MD) of 10,435’. The lateral extended another 9,609’ to a total depth of 20,044’. It was drilled with a 6” bit and cased with 4 1/2” liner. The drilling ﬂuid was oil based mud for the vertical and curve segments but during the lateral it was substituted with brine. <br/>Wellsite geological services began within the Kibbey Formation at a MD of 7,800’. Thirty foot lagged samples were collected during the vertical and curve, and ﬁﬁy foot lagged <br/>samples were collected in the lateral. Samples were cleaned, catalogued, and saved for archive at the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library in Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br/>Vertical 7,800’ - 9, 703’ IUD <br/>Logging services began in the Kibbey Formation at a measured depth of 7,800’ at 9:45 am CDT on November 11, 2014 aﬁer tripping into the hole with a new bit. The vertical segment was drilled with a HTC MM65D type bit which was added at 7,126’ MD. The primary olT-set well was Howo 8-33—4TF2H as it was drilled on the same pad as Howo 4—33-4TFH. The samples collected within the Kibbey Formation were generally described as a light brown to red brown, slightly calcareous, dolomitic shaly siltstone. Formation gas in the Kibbey Formation averaged 61 units with the highest reading of 64 units. A Pason chromatograph gas detection system was used to monitor gas. The Charles Formation was encountered shortly after logging services began. <br/>Charles 7,916 ’ MD 7,915 ’ TVD -6, 009’ SS <br/>The top of the Charles Formation was encountered at 7916’ measured depth (MD) when a relatively massive salt unit, indicative of the Charles top, was encountered. Lithology identiﬁed in the Charles included salt, anhydrite, mudstone, crystalline limestone, and dolomitic limestone. Fast and consistent penetration rates deﬁned the Charles’ salt benches fairly well. Along with gamma data, drilling signatures such as differential pressure, weight on bit, rotary and torque were also useful in determining the depths of the salts with indications of easy drilling. Penetration rates averaged 57 fph throughout the Charles Formation but up to 84 fph in the salts. Formation gas readings were fairly consistent at about 63 units, however, slight surges in gas were at times detected directly below impermeable evaporate layers. </p>

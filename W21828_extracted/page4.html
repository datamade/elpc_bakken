Oil will be sold via a commingled battery and truck run tickets. Water will be measured via a commingled battery and truck run tickets. <br/>Oil sales volume per well will be calculated as follows: <br/>1. The oil well test volume will represent the summation of three days (72 hours) ofoil production from one well through a dedicated 3 phase separator and dedicated tank battery. Oil volume <br/>will be measured by corioilis meter or tank measurement. 2. Pad oil well test volume will be the summation of the oil well test volume from each well that <br/>produces into the associated commingled tank battery. <br/>3. Monthly sold oil pad volume will represent the sum of the prior month’s run tickets as measured by the purchaser, for all well sin the commingled tank battery. <br/>4. The allocated monthly sales oil volume will represent the sum of the oil well test volume divided <br/>by the Pad oil well test volume times the Monthly sold oil gad volume. 5. The allocated monthly sales oil volume will be the basis for allocated revenue to each well. <br/>Water volume per well will be calculated as follows: <br/>1.

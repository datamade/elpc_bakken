Oil and water will be continuously measured in a combined liquid phase via a Coriolis meter and NOC (net oii computer). Gas will be measured continuoust via an orifice~plate or cone meter. After the individual weli liquid volumes have been separately measured, liquid from each 2—phase separator will dump into a bulk three phase separator. Oil will dump from the 3-phase separator into tanks or to a pipeline LACT (lease automated custody transfer}. Water wiil dump from the 3-phase separator to tanks or a pipeline LACT <br/>The oil sales volume per well will be calculated as follows: <br/>1. The meter factor will represent the most recent vaiid meter factor based on quarterly master </p>

The meterfactor will include a correction to standard conditions based on <br/>proving data, measured fluid temperatures and pressures. Measured daily well volume will be the measured oil volume as recorded by the coriolis meter. <br/>The measured daily well volume will be corrected to standard conditions via the net oil computer. Measurement will be done continuously. Triangle personnel will verify the NOC (net <br/>oil computer) measurement daily. Measured meter data will be stored and archived. Measured montth well volumes will represent the sum ofthe prior months measureddiily volumes times the meter factor. <br/>The measured monthly pad volume will represent the sum ofthe measured monthly well <br/>volumes from each well. <br/>The custody transfer pad volume will represent the actual volume sold through a LACT or tank gauges and trucks. <br/>The monthly well sales volume will be calculated by multiplying the custody transfer pad volume times the measured monthly well volume divided by the monthly measured gad volume. <br/>Well revenue will be calculated based 0n the monthly well sales volume. </p>

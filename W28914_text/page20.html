The EN-VP&R-154-94-2536H-2 was a Middle Bakken multiple cross section lateral running southwest starting in Section 24 and ending in the southeast corner of Section 36. The EN-VP&R-154-94-2536H-2 surface location was set in Section 24 T154N R94W, in Mountrail County, North Dakota. The surface spud date with the surface casing rig was on October 14, 2014, with the vertical hole spud date with Nabors BOl starting November 9, 2014. EN-VP&R-154—94-2536H-2 reached a total measured depth of the veitical hole at 10,185 MD on November 1 1, 2014 at 5:30 pm CST. Starting at the end ofthe vertical hole a build curve was drilled into the Middle Bakken fonnation landing at 1 1,046’ MD on November 14, 2014 at 12:07 am CST. An eight and three quarter-inch well bore was drilled in both the vertical hole and build curve using an invert mud system. The Middle Bakken lateral was drilled using a 5.875” drill bit while using a salt water based mud system EN-VP&R-15494-2536H-2 Middle Bakken lateral began on December 5, 2014 at 11,046‘ MD. The EN-VP&R154-94-2536H-2 Middle Bakken lateral reached a total depth of 20,71 1’ MD on December 8, 2014 at 10:55 pm. Neset Consulting well site geological services began at 8,100’ MD just above the Kibbey Lime formation, thirty foot lagged samples were caught from 8,100’ to 1 1,046’ ending in the Middle Bakken formation for the straight hole and build curve. During the Middle Bakken lateral 100' samples would be caught from 11,046‘ to 20,711’ MD. Total Gas Detection wireless system was utilized throughout the vertical, build curve, and lateral sections of the EN— VP&R-154-94-2536H-2. <br/>Vertical Wellbore </p>

    <p class="styleSans14.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Wellsite geological services began at 8,150' MD just above the Kibbey Lime formation. Multiple formations would be recorded before reaching KOP including the Charles, Ratcliffe, Rival, and Lodgepole formation. The Kibbey Lime was recorded off of a gamma marker decrease and lithology change from tan to brown sandstone to light brown to tan limestone. The Kibbey Lime top was recorded at 8,188’ TVD and would be drilled through at 8,346' TVD where the top of the Charles formation was recorded. The top of the Charles formation mainly consists of large sections of hard salt. Drill rates would increase in these sections as well as gamma count decreases in order to locate most salt sections. Sections of limestone interbedded with gummy anhydrite sections would make up the remainder of the Charles. At 8,951 ’ TVD the Charles ended and the Last Salt formation began, which is mainly an extension of the Charles Salts but serves as an indicator of the last salt marker throughout the remaining formations to be drilled. The Last Salt formation is used as an early landing marker for the build curve in this area of North Dakota as well as Lodgepole markers. The Last Salt formation was 28' thick and the Base of the Last Salt was recorded at 8,989' TVD. A slight transition section between the Base of the Last Salt of 39' was drilled before reaching the Ratcliffe formation at 9,028’ TVD, and was mainly made up of dark gray to light brown limestone with moderate amounts of anhydrite beds included through the formation. The Ratcliffe formation was drilled over 141' and the top of the Rival formation was reached at 9,169' TVD. Rival formation lithology continued with limestone, cream to light gray brown to tan in color, with dolomite and anhydrite layers. The Rival was drilled until reaching the Lodgepole formation at 9,725' TVD. The Lodgepole is marked by several progressive LP markers to aid in landing the build curve in case of any </p>

The Lodgepole was determined off of the pre—detennined Lodgepole gamma marker and subtle color change in samples. Four Lodgepole markers were recorded before reaching kick off point at 10,185' MD. KOP was reached at 5:30 pm on November 11, 2014. The rig then pulled out of the hole to pick up the build curve assembly. <br/>Build Curve <br/>The EN-VP&R-154—94—2536H-2 build cuwe began on November 12, 2014 at a measured depth of 10,185’ in the mid portion of the Lodgepole formation and was drilled with an average drill rate of 50-70 ft/hr while sliding and rotating. The Lodgepole consisted of soft to ﬁrm limestone, that is also light gray, gray, and light gray brown in color. Landing estimations ﬂuctuated as high as 10,647' TVD and as low as 10,694' TVD throughout the Lodgepole formation with the original projected TVD set at 10,656' TVD. The ideal landing was set at 1 0, 664 ’ T VD once recording the top of the Middle Bakken formation at 10, 639’ T VD. <br/>Shortly after beginning the curve the directional team noticed that the motor was not performing to expectation and was not yielding the build rates needed to land at the targeted landing point. This was discussed with the Company Man, and it was decided to evaluate the performance of the motor after each survey in order to make as much progress as possible. <br/>The Upper Bakken Shale formation was encountered at the base of the Lodgepole formation at a MD of 10,695' and a TVD of 10,604'. The lithology of shale was black in color and very carbonaceous with fair yellow oil shows. The top of the Bakken shale was 4' low from projection which projected the estimated landing to 10,659' TVD. The shale was entered at approximately 59 degrees and exited at approximately 65 degrees. After 58' MD and 27' TVD the base of the Bakken Shale was reached and the top of the Middle Bakken was encountered at a MD of 10,768' and TVD of 10,639', projecting landing at 10,664‘ TVD. Lithology moved from carbonaceous shale to light brown to brown to light brown gray sandstone. Shows maintained fair quality with yellow cuts. Drill rates decreased slightly and averaged 50-60 ft/hr while rotating and sliding. At this point the motor was yielding very poor build rates. The directional team noted that the motor would not be able to provide build rates necessary to land 25’ into the Middle Bakken. A lower landing was cleared by the Operations Geologist with the understanding that the lateral would begin by drilling back up to the original landing point. <br/>The EN-VP&R-154-94-2536H-2 build curve was landed at 11,046' MD and 10,681.08’ <br/>TVD on November 14, 2014 at 12:07 am. CST. The rig proceeded to ream the curve wellbore and trip out to lay down build cuwe tools before picking up 7" casing. </p>

Initial targets were set at 90.0 degrees based off the EN VP&R 154-94-2536 H-l Three Forks lateral. The center target line was set 17’ above landing location. The directional team drilled up to the base of the target window over a course of 750’ before starting the 30 degree azimuth turn 11,785’ MD to move due south from 150 degrees to 180 degrees. Thirty foot surveys were taken through the duration <br/>of the turn, as required by North Dakota state requirements. The ideal geological window targeted a drilling line 25' into the Middle Bakken formation with a hard line set at 40'. The turn was completed at 12,750’ MD and the directional team returned to taking ninety foot surveys for </p>

Slides were done to stop the wellbore from building in rotary and allow more rotary drilling to TD of the S lateral. The wellbore continued to build in rotary through the target window and exited the top of the target interval with the wellbore ending in the upper portion of the Middle Bakken. TD of the South lateral was reached @ 20,510’ at 12:35 am. CDT on September 24, 2014. TD was called at 20,510’ MD for the Skedsvold #21-4-3H with the wellbore ending in the upper portion of the Middle Bakken. The formation throughout the lateral had an overall estimated dip rate of 90.03 degrees. Total depth of the South Lateral was reached at 20,510’ MD at 12:35 am. CDT on September 24, 2014 with 9,236’ of open horizontal hole drilled. </p>

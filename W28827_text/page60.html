After entering the upper portion of the target interval the upper clean gamma bench was seen indicating that the formation had a slight down dip of 89.98 degrees. Drilling continued throughout the day with the wellbore steadily tracking the lower half of the Middle Bakken target window building slightly in rotary reaching the upper portion of the target window seeing the A to C transition with the clean gamma indicating that the formation had begun to head down section at around 89.9 degrees. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 120 —— 150 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 30 - 50 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 700 — 1100 units with connection gases reaching as high as 1,706 units. </p>

Slides were done throughout the day to continue working on keeping the wellbore slightly above dip to continue tracking the lower half of the Middle Bakken target interval with the formation dip set at 90.1 degrees. Aﬁer worldng on a slide for direction the wellbore began to rapidly build in TVD and head up section at 91.5 degrees and exited the top of the target window seeing the A/C contact. After seeing this slides were done to work on keeping the wellbore pointed down below dip to drop the wellbore in TVD back into the top of the Middle Bakken target interval. As the wellbore would reach the top of the target window it would deﬂect and begin heading back up section at around 91 to 91.5 degrees. Slides were done again and the wellbore began to head down section at 88 degrees. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 130 - 150 ﬁ/hr while rotating and around 30 - 50 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Background gases averaged around 400 — 800 units. <br/>Day 5 17,400’ — 19,250’ MD </p>

    <p class="styleSans12.0000<enum PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL of type PangoWeight><enum PANGO_STYLE_NORMAL of type PangoStyle>">Drilling continued with S lateral with the wellbore dropping in TVD through the formation at 88 degrees and dropping back into the Middle Bakken target interval seeing the A to C contact giving the formation a calculated dip rate of 89.98 degrees. Slides were done after reaching the middle of the target interval to level the wellbore out and continue tracking the lower half of the Middle Bakken target window. Throughout the rest of the day the wellbore consistently tracked the middle to lower portion of the target window. Penetration rates throughout the day averaged around 130 — 150 ft/hr while rotating and around 30 — 50 ﬁ/hr while sliding. Backgron gases averaged around 400 — 700 units with connection gases reaching as high as 1,156 units. The samples seen throughout the target window continued to exhibit a cream tan/light to medium tan dolomite with an even dull yellow green ﬂuorescence and a slow faint streaming to cloudy yellow green cut. </p>
